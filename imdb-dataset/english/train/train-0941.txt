<START> this is a totally delightful and unexpected film you start by following a young person who hopes to get into the qualifying football game between bahrain and iran if iran win they will get into the 2006 world cup in germany the problem is the young person is a girl and girls or women for that matter are not allowed into football matches to sit with men what follows is a wonderful comedy played with consummate skill by a small ensemble cast the film explores the absurdity of restrictions on the freedom of women and for that matter the young soldiers who have to corral them there are some excellent set pieces not least when one of the girls must go to the toilet and of course the stadium has no toilets for women the camera work is of the simplest and in some ways this story could have been told as a stage play yet it is the small scale that gives the film its bite great cinema no probably not great entertainment for sure
<START> first of all sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie nothing less than this available the film fails in every department be it screenplay direction characterization or acting br br 1 to start with the name of the movie is really c class though the movie itself match up to the name 2 amitabh bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character 3 in sholay gabbar singh has reward of 50 000 on him which was convincing here in aag the figure was 100 crores for babban amitabh bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero's and had only few men bikes to commute with all automatic guns making a sholay like movie in mumbai type setup in modern time doesn't look convincing 4 as for nisha kothari somebody needs to tell her that she doesn't know acting why is ram gopal verma casting her again and again 5 mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do 6 sushant singh and rajpal yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie 7 legendry role played by lila misra mausi of basanti in sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some gangu mummy ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie enough of stupid characters in your movie like shiva and aag 8 should not say anything about modern jai and veeru pathetic to the greatest extent br br to summarize i was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic please don't waste money and time on this movie i think watching aap ka surror which i thought was the worst movie possible would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters bad songs and miserable direction br br thanks saurabh
<START> very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves i can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write this film simply smacked of the real world the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter the live in relatives and their quarrels the troubled child who gets knocked up and then typically drops out of school a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it 2 thumbs up
<START> you know all those letters to father christmas and jesus that are sent every year well it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them as bizarre settings go it's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is dead letter office having said that this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one if it was royal mail most letters get this sort of treatment anyway i haven't been in this flat for two years and we're still getting letters for a mr wang some female priest of the church of latter day i've never heard of you and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company br br dead letter office the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up follows the story of alice miranda otto who grows up in a seriously divided home writing to her absent father she only learns in adulthood that her letters haven't been delivered for one reason or another so logically she gets a job at the d l o and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding chilean immigrant frank lopez george del hoyo slowly she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self contained world of the dead letters office to its knees br br nothing against this film but i was reminded of the god awful heather graham film committed while watching this however this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again that ain't difficult for a start this film is much more logical true the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel it is also well acted both otto and del hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they'll never find while other characters are peripheral at best part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed the other part is that when you consider australia's draconian immigration policy i e if you don't speak english rack off such a story is unlikely to take place in reality the other characters sadly also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd ball stereotypes br br despite that dead letter office is certainly something a little different it might not be to everyone's taste but i liked it yes it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes it's nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy duty swearing and nudity no chance of that in an australian film there ain't any major laughs there's no bullet time and the characters are usually one dimensional but it's the story that counts here and while it's not earth shattering in its magnificence it's a pleasant enough way of passing the time it's the movie equivalent of a sheryl crow cd nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn't really miss it if it wasn't there
<START> i first saw this movie when it was released in the u s in 1984 i have seen it many many times since what strikes me about the film is the incorporation of the art of the rehearsal into the lives of the characters and visa versa throughout the movie the two intertwine and at times one is never too sure if one is watching the lives of the characters or a scene from a rehearsal this continues up to the climax of the film all these years later my friends and i still love to debate whether or not carmen is really stabbed at the end from the reactions of the other characters to the stylized murder it is open to debate the passion of the dance the quality of the acting the love of art and the brilliance of the performances all combine to create a superb movie that once again blends and twists the line between life and art
<START> it's a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their rollicking kids i felt like instead of a movie ticket i should have been given a nambla membership br br based upon thomas rockwell's respected book how to eat fried worms starts like any children's story moving to a new town the new kid fifth grader billy forrester was once popular but has to start anew making friends is never easy especially when the only prospect is poindexter adam or erica who at 4 1 2 feet is a giant br br further complicating things is joe the bully his freckled face and sleeveless shirts are daunting he antagonizes kids with the death ring a crackerjack ring that is rumored to kill you if you're punched with it but not immediately no the death ring unleashes a poison that kills you in the eight grade br br joe and his axis of evil welcome billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos once discovered billy plays it cool swearing that he eats worms all the time then he throws them at joe's face ewww to win them over billy reluctantly bets that he can eat 10 worms fried boiled marinated in hot sauce squashed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich each meal is dubbed an exotic name like the radioactive slime delight in which the kids finally live out their dream of microwaving a living organism br br if you've ever met me you'll know that i have an uncontrollably hearty laugh i felt like a creep erupting at a toddler whining that his dilly dick hurts but fried worms is wonderfully disgusting like a g rated farrelly brothers film it is both vomitous and delightful br br writer director bob dolman is also a savvy storyteller to raise the stakes the worms must be consumed by 7 pm in addition billy holds a dark secret he has an ultra sensitive stomach br br dolman also has a keen sense of perspective with such accuracy he draws on children's insecurities and tendency to exaggerate mundane dilemmas br br if you were to hyperbolize this movie the way kids do their quandaries you will see that it is essentially about war freedom fighter and freedom hater use pubescent boys as pawns in proxy wars only to learn a valuable lesson in unity international leaders can learn a thing or two about global peacekeeping from fried worms br br at the end of the film i was comforted when two chaperoning mothers behind me looked at each other with befuddlement and agreed that was a great movie great now i won't have to register myself in any lawful databases
<START> one of the best movies out there yeah maybe the cinematography wasn't the greatest but an excellent plot and concept great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas something different from the usual movies and great fun one of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies post world war 3 and fighting in gigantic robots the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth while the sets are not amazing but simple and worked for the overall look of the film this movie is very hard to find on dvd but also on vhs check it out cause i have loved it since it came out not a mainstream flick and not like anything you've ever seen take a look and think like a child it's a great view and very fun
<START> but the opposite sorry bud i completely understand how you can be dragged into a film because you relate to the subject and you have this film is terrible the main character would give any charlie brown subtitler a run for his money he just constantly mumbles which is always a laugh most scenes just feel awkward with characters more often than not gazing across to another with a look of its your line now then i will react best british comedy please buddy have a strong word with your bad bad self at the end of the day the sun goes down and this film is awful i mean well done to the people involved they have made a film and maybe motorbike enthusiasts may be into it but people that still live here on earth with an actual sense of humour will struggle with this more than smiling at the christmas present they're nan bought them was that overly harsh i do apologise

<START> thhe2 is entertaining in that you'll laugh a lot and cringe and probably say oh sh t and get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumb s or things along those lines but i don't know if its really worth seeing i was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who don't seem to know the first thing about combat br br yes there was more violence gore and a higher body count than the first one but i am still am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is and not a good ridiculousness like dead alive or feast my time would have been better spent watching aja's remake for the 5th time br br so go for some laughs or go for some gore but don't go hoping to come out of it satisfied

<START> vampires vs zombies starts with the breaking news that the unidentified disease that is spreading across america leaves the sufferer with homicidal cannibalistic tendencies travis fontaine c s munro his teenage daughter jenna bonny giroux listen to the radio as they drive along the isolated backwoods roads to try escape the disease when travis runs over a guy who i assume is meant to be a zombie slightly further down the road he stops to help julia brinke stevens her teenage daughter carmilla maratama carlson who are waving at the side of the road at this point there is also a third teenage girl named tessa melanie crystal sitting in the back of julia's car bound gagged to me this situation would seem strange but travis like the trooper he is takes it all in his stride agrees to 'take' carmilla off julia's hands well i don't know actually so with a complete stranger travis drives off leaving julia tessa carmilla seems like a nice girl but she turns out to be a vampire she likes to bite people turn them into vampires oh she's partial to a bit of lesbianism too travis carmilla jenna continue to travel while some guy who calls himself the general peter ruginis who appears to be some sort of vampire killer probably has something to do with it all but the film is such a mess it doesn't really matter i really don't know how to carry on this plot outline as my head hurts just thinking about it br br co edited co executive produced written directed by the supremely untalented vince d'amato vampires vs zombies is one of the worst horror films ever therefore one of the worst films ever period the script by d'amato was apparently based on a classic story entitled 'carmilla' by sheridan le fanu he should sue is an absolute mess the holes in the plot logic are so big you could drive a tank through them what is the disease that turns people into zombies why is carmilla a vampire who is julia to her who the hell is the general what does he want where are travis jenna going how can travis run a man over yet not have the slightest bit of human emotion over it what's with the mental ward at the end there are also some confusing unnecessary dream sequences just to annoy the viewer even more there are just so many things wrong with this film the narrative doesn't make a blind bit of sense the concept is terrible never really explained properly plus it's incredibly boring i have not one positive thing to say about vampire vs zombies not one forget about any vampires fighting zombies because it just doesn't happen tell me again why is this film called vampires vs zombies br br director d'amato has served up one of the most incompetent rubbishy badly made poorly thought out excruciatingly painful viewing experiences ever made vampires vs zombies really has no redeeming qualities at all there is not one single aspect that i can praise the gore is really fake looking there are some blood splats which look like red water some really cheap staking effects a half decent climax where the zombies feast on carmilla's jenna's intestines this fairly gory scene is probably the best part of the whole wretched film but it only lasts for a couple of minutes in no way makes up for the other turgid 85 br br the budget on vampires vs zombies must have been small in fact did it even have a budget because most of it is set on a road in a couple of cars this is one of the most badly made horror films it's been my misfortune to watch the entire thing just sucks the acting is predictably awful i mean awful br br there isn't much else left to say vampires vs zombies is easily one of the worst films ever made the v next to the title on the imdb's main page for vampires vs zoimbies indicates that it went straight to video well that's far too good for this pile of crap as it deserves to go straight on the nearest fire
<START> in a near future the ordinary man above any suspicious from the suburb morgan sullivan jeremy northam is hired by digicorp a huge corporation to be assigned as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors sunways along his training morgan is brainwashed assumes a new identity of jack thursby and travels to boring lectures in one of them he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious rita foster lucy liu who advises him that nothing is how it seems to be morgan acknowledges a new reality where he does not know who can be trusted br br the unknown cypher was a great surprise for me this movie has not been released in brazil but the engaging and exciting story is quite complex with many plot points and with great screenplay direction and performances in the very last twist i recalled arnold schwarzenegger's total recall this movie certainly deserves to be watched more than once and i really did not like the last scene when the independent spy disposes the disputed disc in the sea in only know the director vicenzo natali from the fantastic cube and this second work i see is also stunning my vote is eight br br title brazil not available
<START> i work with children from 0 Â 6 years old and they all love the doodlebops the doodlebops are energetic vibrant and appealing once they start singing ''we're the doodlebops we're the doodlebops we're the doodlebops oh yeah come and join the fun because we're laughing and we're singing all day it is almost impossible not to join them in song the doodlebops brings the viewer into a world of color and fun each show is an adventure the doodlebops do not try to change the world with preachy messages all they do is have fun while sorting out everyday life challenges that the young child may relate to the doodlebops is an refreshing high action alternative to regular children's television programs
<START> revolt of the zombies is bad there is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie it is dull lifeless poorly acted and poorly scripted i've often complained that the original dracula is a little slow for my taste well this movie makes dracula look like a roller coaster ride the 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutes br br the story an expedition is sent to cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through zombification one man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him once this happens he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences that's it that's the whole story br br for most of the movie i was trying to figure out where i had seen the male lead he looked so familiar i had plenty of time to think this over nothing was happening in the movie just before the zombies revolted it hit me it was dean jagger i had seen him recently as the general in white christmas this is how i entertained myself throughout most of the movie br br i'm just glad i didn't buy the dvd for this movie king of the zombies is on the other side and it's a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie for what it's worth i'll give it a 2 10 i won't go to 1 10 because believe it or not i've seen worse
<START> i was very surprised how bad this movie was nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far i was hoping for a rerun of hero but this is much much worse br br this movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place no believable characters even within the cartoonish world of kung fu movies these characters are ridiculous virtually no plot and ridiculous story twists br br this movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child every time you think your silly battle makes some sense they invent another ridiculous twist that makes no sense ah ha you only think you've got me with your super powers and 10 000 ray guns but i ate my vitamins laced with plutonium and teflon so your ray guns don't work and i'm invulnerable to your super powers tap tap no trade backs infinity plus one children can continue with this lunacy because they don't really care whether anyone is listening because they are having a fun time however for the viewer especially the adult viewer this long movie is worse than a bout with bad gas br br spoilers ahead note to kung fu movie makers a if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on pcp in which case your kung fu is not strong b if you repeatedly fall on your back which has a knife in it it will hurt more and do more damage unless it is a fake prop c when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife you die especially in ancient china where there isn't a kaiser permanente around the corner d kung fu fights don't last for hours while 3 feet of snow falls and e sometimes it is worth while explaining your characters and their motivations br br in any event go watch hero again because at least within its own little world it is comprehensible
<START> dutch schultz aka arthur fleggenheimer was a real person and his rather nasty life is fairly well documented this movie which purports to depict his life should have used a fictional character because the overdramatized events are too strong a departure from the facts and the chronology not only that it ignores some interesting details which other versions have included such as the public relations fiasco in upstate n y and his religious conversion it is true that he was executed by luciano lansky et al but that's as far as it goes the exploding plate scene which represents luciano carrying out the execution of bo weinberg in his own home assisted by his own mother is rediculous also there is the scene in which dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to legs diamond it just doesn't work the character of mrs fleggenheimer doesn't work either this movie does not need a doting jewish mother for comic relief the lame representation of legs diamond was humorous enough i'm sure the man is turning in his grave and by the way dutch did in fact personally kill people but he was not rambo or 007 the scene in which he wipes out the brewery is absurd i don't know maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and i just didn't get it
<START> a hilarious and insightful perspective of the dating world is portrayed in this off beat comedy by first time writer director peter m cohen the story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local diner to confer about their dating woes we meet brad a good looking wall street playboy with a quick wit and sharp tongue zeek a cynical sensitive writer jonathan a sexually perplexed nice guy with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation and eric the married guy who cherishes his weekly encounters with his single friends in hope for some enlightenment to his boring and banal married existence the trials and tribulations of the men's single lives in new york are amusingly expressed mirroring that of sex in the city and hbo's new comedy the mind of married man and bring an astute light to scamming the story takes a twist as the three singletons meet mia wittily played by amanda peet and all fall for her she seduces them each with her uncanny ability to conform to the personalities' they exhibit when they come to realize they have all met and fallen in love with the same woman they chose her over their friendship whipped is a realistic portrayal of the dating world one that the critic's failed to recognize in plain language they missed the point the protagonist's here are caricatures of real people the exaggerations are hysterical mixing satire and humility and are not to be taken as seriously as the critic's disparagement suggests see this movie you'll laugh from start to finish
<START> slaughter high is perhaps the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s it is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout that being said it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula a group of young men and women get killed one by one gruesomely until the final showdown br br the reason why slaughter high stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more over the top marty the killer has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates they electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girl's locker room shower jabbed at his crotch with a javelin and to top it off rigged his science lab experiment so it could disfigure him br br so the victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get when they reunite years later at a high school reunion put on by marty himself you realize they haven't matured all that much they're a bunch of sociopaths br br it is mind boggling why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion which by the way is held at a school that has since fell into disrepair and who would think it's a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers as well as marty's on display there are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film the ending makes little or no sense and the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how april fool's day works the movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noon br br in all the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre despite all of its flaws it is hard to understand why it hasn't yet found its way to dvd when so many other run of the mill slasher flicks are graced with special editions
