<START> i felt obliged to watch this movie all the way through since i had found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own but i came close many times to turning it off and just writing off the money i had paid for it if you are a fan of gore and sadism this movie is ok if there is one thing that the makers of this film know it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a sickening effect if that doesn't thrill you then stay away br br this movie is shot on a home video camera with grade school props and terrible actors it's dubbed from german but even allowing for that the sound is awful this film is about as budget as budget gets except for the aforementioned special effects if they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and guts the film might have been a little more enjoyable br br the story is about three men that land on an island inhabited by an army of tin masked sadists they are captured and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape i call this a story in the loosest sense since it is really a series of scenes of torture and combat strung together by inane obscenity filled dialog br br there is nothing whatsoever redeeming about this movie unless you like mindless gore consider yourself warned
<START> we actually watched this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time maybe we'd missed something nope what's missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction i actually went back to robbin's novel to see if i could find the problem and i discovered that what i thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy headed junk br br so the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there absolutely nothing works not a blessed thing some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots all of the actors look at least uncomfortable angie dickenson looks positively mortified except for rain phoenix who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is the dialog is one long unwavering cringe scenes don't make sense from second to second and the connections between them are nonexistent and yet the movie stumbles blindly on convinced that it is saying something profound br br this is too bad to even be funny it is simply excruciating gus van zant has done other good to great movies which i encourage you to see and i'm happy he survived and appears to have learned from this mess
<START> robot jox tries hard but is fundamentally a series of fight scenes strung together robot against robot man against man man against woman the premise had potential but it seems the script wasn't really given the couple of more drafts it needed still it was fairly good for a science fiction action movie part of it was because the script was by joe haldeman for those who aren't familiar with the name haldeman wrote the award winning science fiction novel the forever war it's considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels right up there with robert heinlein's starship troopers and john steakley's armor and this movie is really more like a giant powered battle armor movie rather than giant robots it's closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the travesty that was paul verhoeven's starship troopers which bore only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based on br br despite some assumptions this really isn't based on homer's iliad a couple of names are all they had in common achilles having his robot's foot blown off had no parallel in the iliad which didn't include achilles' death nor was the ancient achilles a noble warrior he was the mightiest but also vengeful and petty even the robot jock killed off in the first scene doesn't fit he was named hercules while the greek iliad would have had herakles br br the effects were fairly good for the time and the budget true it wasn't comparable to terminator 2 a year later but that movie cost ten times as much the stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers in the empire strikes back and return of the jedi better in fact than a lot of ray harryhausen animation which is highly regarded but quite dated br br don't bring high expectations into this and you probably won't be disappointed it's better than a lot of other low budget flicks and even some big budget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects but far worse scripts
<START> the only show i have watched since 90210 why did they discontinue it it was the only show that captured the essence of hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all the least they should do is release it on dvd br br i checked out similar shows but nothing has come close the cast had incredible chemistry and i looked forward to each episode with much anticipation br br they made a big mistake by pulling that show if anyone has any info regarding where i can obtain a dvd of north shore please post a few lines here thanks aloha
<START> this movie was so good leon phelps is hilarious i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of cognac
<START> it takes patience to get through david lynch's eccentric but for a change life affirming chronicle of alvin straight's journey but stick with it though it moves as slow as straight's john deere when he meets the kind strangers along his pilgrimage we learn much about the isolation of aging the painful regrets and secrets and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation richard farnsworth caps his career with the year's most genuine performance sad and poetic flinty and caring and sissy spacek matches him as his slow daughter rose who pines over her own private loss while caring for dad rarely has a modern film preached so positively about family
<START> not to be confused with the above average supernatural thriller the sentinel the sentinel was a big bore of a movie for me not delivering the consistent action a couple of critics promised on the back to me it seemed like everyone was halfassing it and only there to make some quick cash because this felt very much like a made for tv film the sentinel is a rehash of several better films like in the line of fire this does not have any originality in it and watching michael douglas run around felt kinda silly in my opinion the main problem besides it's unoriginality had to be the poor pace i often got distracted while trying to view this movie while looking how much run time was left more then once not only the miscasting with eva longoria who couldn't convince worth a lick br br performances michael douglas is usually a dependable actor here is obviously going through the motions he does not convince as a man on a run or a secret agent his chemistry with bassinger was also off i'm a big fan of kiefer sutherland but here he is only ok nothing more then that he tries to come across as a gruff but managed to be more bland then anything else and to be honest he didn't seem that interested eva longoria parker is pretty mediocre she does not convince in her role and was pure eye candy kim basinger is pretty terrible as the 1st lady she looks bored to tears and her role is a throw away more then anything else martin donovan has a big part in the end but not enough to matter for me br br bottom line the sentinel is yet another political thriller that bored me to tears it's too old too tired and most importantly the lack of effort sucked not recommended br br 4 10
<START> despite the lavish production numbers and wonderful costumes this film is a chore to watch the murder mystery plot is just a vehicle to mount the musical numbers on but it often brings the proceedings to a staggering halt besides not being very involving although there has obviously been a lot of money spent on them the numbers are badly staged and poorly photographed it's obviously a pre code film because the girls often wear very little clothing and there's even a song singing the praises of marijuana the performances are all one note although it's nice to see carl brisson in a musical but when victor mclaglen as the police lieutenent lurches into view for the umpteenth time on the hunt for clues you may want to throw in the towel or at least fast forward to the next number pity the patrons who were trapped in the cinema on its release though
<START> whoa boy br br ever wanted to watch a documentary about a megalomaniacal jerk ruining his own life and alienating everyone around him well they exist in many forms but have you ever wanted to watch said documentary about one who didn't ultimately succeed in doing anything despite everyone's praises about how much of an artistic genius he is well you could probably just grab a camera and find someone like that in any local scene i know they're everywhere and i don't even follow the local scene or you could save yourself the trouble by spending money watching this tripe br br the premise is good and honestly it's not as if the filmmakers knew precisely where it was going considering that's one of the difficulties of doing a documentary we are made to follow two bands the brian jamestown massacre lead by anton and the dandy warhols lead by courtney i've heard of the dandy warhols before watching this movie not so the brian jamestown massacre why well from this documentary's perspective because the brian jamestown massacre's intergroup dysfunction refused them the ability to really make it in the music industry however instead of this becoming an analysis of the two separate bands and how one was able to succeed the focus becomes much more on anton and his insanity br br because see anton is a genius because he plays rock music he really understands the evolution of music because he plays rock music with a lot of different instruments his music is considered post modern retro but the future because it's rock music he wants to bring out a revolution through rock music okay so let's face it twenty minutes in and this is one of the stupidest kids i'd care to watch a documentary about br br the documentary itself doesn't really lend itself to showcasing any of anton's talent because in the nature of editing down 2000 hours of material into a quarter short of two hours we don't really have the time to focus on that so instead we watch anton the genius the socio maniacal loser be a jerk for the two hours and are just told to understand that he made really great music whether he did or not i won't know because its not like the documentary had enough time to prove it what i do know is that then we're left with a story about some self centered obnoxious twerp running around the country calling himself a god of music and doing nothing to back it up why even bother watching that people like anton don't deserve the attention they seek the hope and admiration of all those different people and especially a post failure paean to lost potential this movie plays like a two hour rough cut vh1 special for a reason he goes on and on about the music but it's all about the image and the attention look at the guy look at how he dresses look at how he acts look at how he tries to create controversy because he can't afford marketing br br honestly the only interesting character in this film is joel and that's because of anyone in this documentary joel is the only person who seems to have any fun maybe it's because he's the tambourine man the rest of them are all rock stars they deserve our attention and admiration and interest and engagements they are out there to save rock and roll do you remember when the white stripes were supposed to save rock and roll yeah that was because of anton and it's selfish of them not to mention me anton as an inspiration what a load people like anton are best left forgotten this documentary explains why mainstream music is so dull because music execs have to deal with people like anton for a living and ultimately can only really throw their support behind someone safe and passionless thanks a lot anton your antics ruined music for everyone you touched whatever the opinion to the contrary is and if people in the know about anton disagree and he really was a genius it still shows how bad this documentary is that it cuts it down that way br br polarisdib
<START> a lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a grisham novel altman creates a suspenseful gothic atmosphere but the script is weak sporting a southern drawl branagh is convincing as the lawyer and davidtz is alluring as the object of his desire downey is likable as a private detective duvall has a small role which does not allow him to do much with his weird character hannah and berenger round out the impressive cast after an interesting setup the film bogs down and does not really deliver on its initial promise but altman is always worth a look
<START> i'm guessing the writers have never read a book of any kind much less a dickens novel and certainly not david copperfield and that they based their screenplay on another poorly written screenplay possibly an adaptation of copperfield though just as likely anything else from which they randomly discarded about a third of the pages and then shuffled the rest along with some random pages from a screenplay that someone's eighth grade nephew had written for an english class and for which he had received a failing grade br br if the casting was a bad joke e g richards as kramer playing micawber which it was then the direction and acting were the poorly delivered punch lines getting beyond kramer as micawber if possible ham was such a complete ogre hunch back and all that i was half expecting at some point to see him being pursued by an angry pitch fork and torch wielding mob of villagers uriah was almost as much of a clown figure as micawber mr murdstone evoked about as much terror as that muppet vampire from sesame street the actor playing older david was i believe actually a woman in any case looking perpetually as if he wished he could find a mirror to see how pretty he looked and fancied that he looked quite pretty indeed he could scarcely convince us that he was writing with a quill pen and while we're on that subject in one of the many gross inaccuracies perpetrated by the half wit producers of this embarrassment in the unnecessary shots of david writing his story he appears to be somewhere between 18 and 21 years old when he should be in his forties perhaps the greatest transgression although it's difficult to choose was the invented showdown between david and murdstone as he courted a third wife in switzerland preceded of course by the invented death of murdstone's second wife while they were at it it is a wonder they didn't send heep to the guillotine and have him deliver sidney carton's famous last words it couldn't have made things much worse really it might have been far far better br br there are literally thousands of small and large sins against literature throughout this miscarriage of art and anyone who watches it runs the risk of severe and permanent damage to all aspects of their sensibility
<START> visually interesting but falls flat in the originality department this tedious excercise in technique wears thin after the opening battle jude law has the charisma of burnt toast but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue i have ever seen on the big screen in fact the script is so poor that it keeps taking you out of the film and had me thinking about work bills my dogs etc there are many moments that scream bluescreen paltrow is as wooden as they get this could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp my only complaint on the technique is that black white film sorry computer would of helped because it looks like turner colorized black and white just a big dull clichÃ© mess i would rather break my femur than sit through this endurance test again
<START> this film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural cuban town the year of the castro revolution it is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love br br the names cuba libre and cuban blood are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film dreaming of julia makes much more sense it has more in common with european cinema than with rambo and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to people's daily lives and pursuits that fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in cuban history br br the excessive use of the voice over narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator could br br the comparisons to cinema paradiso and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love br br the revolution like the film julie never seems to have an ending
<START> as a long time red sox fan i just had to go see the movie it was great while there can never be enough live footage from the miracle 2004 red sox season there were great shots of some of my favorite red sox players while the movie is certainly a chick flick it has enough baseball footage from the amazing 2004 red sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 movies of all time i especially enjoyed the red sox fans that were part of ben's baseball family the scene where ben is meeting with his buddies on draft day to determine who will get seats to certain games is hilarious a must see if you are looking for a wholesome movie to watch with your spouse date or significant other especially if you are a baseball fan and even more especially if you are red sox fan
<START> this is a romantic comedy where albert einstein played wonderfully by walter matthau and his cronies play match maker to his niece meg ryan and a talented auto mechanic tim robbins the interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrific supporting cast of well recognized character actors this movie is cute and fun a feel gooder hearty recommendations
<START> i have watched 3 episodes of caveman and i have no idea why i continue except maybe waiting for it to get better br br to me this show is just pumping itself off the commercials with no real humor as we sat around watching these shows we all speculated on what was going to happen br br the episode of the woman cave woman with a attitude was actually a big yea right for us she's crude in a theater and acts tough to strangers and truth be told she needed a slap br br i consider myself a pretty good reviewer taking in everything but i must say cavemen is comparable to the old show my mother the car i give it a 2 only because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money on it
<START> ok the plot is wait you got me there is no true discernible plot here just a string of optically fogged sex scenes strung together by scenes of photographers taking pictures of pretty ladies sometimes a combination of the two then a demon comes around kills the men rapes and kills the women and waxes poetic about the meaning of life moronic special effects bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside you get what you expect from a film with a title like this i guess it would have to be someone's cup of tea just not mine as i have yet to see a good kazuo 'gaira' komizu directed film br br dvd extras subtitled interview with director kazuo komizu part 1 part 2 is on the entrails of a beautiful woman dvd and theatrical tailer br br my grade f

<START> i was reviewing some old vhs tapes i have and came across the tv show john denver the muppets a christmas together this made me go to my computer and look it up to see if i could find a dvd version of this show to buy i was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on dvd the show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show i have the record and the cd but i would love to buy a dvd version of this show the tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading the sound is not as good as the cd there is also a few other songs not put on the cd as a fan of john denver and of the muppets a dvd of this show would really be a good seller if you don't have the cd it is a wonderful chritmas collection of songs taken from that show the album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on
