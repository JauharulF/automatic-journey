<START> i watched the first series avidly but wondered whether i'd go back again after a lengthy break from it however i tuned into episode one of series 2 and was hooked all over again this really is excellent telly ground breaking stuff like mission impossible back in the 1960s the characters are well rounded and expand as the series goes on they change as they adapt some more readily than others to their new surroundings but they cleverly remain strictly in character and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for someone whom you wouldn't have thought you could ever feel sorry for when something really crushing happens to them i hope there will be many years of 'lost' to look forward to and i don't actually mind all that much if i never get answers to all the mysteries
<START> the last time i saw the movie i was around seven years so my opinions might be jaded over time at the time i enjoyed the filming that switched between cartoon and live action at the time i felt sad for the blue camel and his sad life also i felt glee when after captain contagious kidnapped the heroine a princess or toy shepherdess the tables the were turned on him unfortunately the producers never decided to transfer this movie to vhs so all i have are twenty year old memories i am sure that if i saw the movie again i would consider it corny and sappy but i really enjoyed it the movie at the time
<START> eye in the labyrinth is not your average giallo and to be honest i'm not really sure that it really is a giallo but giallo or not despite some problems this is certainly a very interesting little film i'm hesitant to call it a giallo because the film doesn't feature most of the things that make these films what they are but many genre entries break the mould and this would seem to be one of them the film doesn't feature any brutal murders as many giallo's do but this is made up for with a surreal atmosphere and a plot just about confusing enough to remain interesting for the duration the plot seems simple enough in that it focuses on a doctor who is murdered by julie his patient who for some reason she sees him as her lover and father and is offended when he walks out on her we then relocate to a big house lived in by a number of people but nothing is really what it seems as there are a number of secrets surrounding various events that happened before julie's arrival br br the film seems to be professing something about how the mind is like a labyrinth this never really comes off and i preferred to just sit back and enjoy what was going on rather than worrying about what point if any the film is trying to make eye in the labyrinth is directed by mario caiano the director behind the excellent night of the doomed some years earlier he doesn't create the atmosphere as well in this film as he did in the earlier one but the surreal aspects of the story come off well and the mystery is always kept up which stops the film from becoming boring the film stars rosemary dexter who provides eye candy throughout and also delivers a good performance most of the rest of the cast aren't really worth mentioning with the exceptions of adolfo celi who is good as the villain of the piece and alida valli whom cult fans will remember from a whole host of excellent cult flicks the film does explain itself at the end which is lucky as i'm sure i'm not the only viewer who was more than a little confused by then overall this may not be classic stuff but its good enough and worth seeing
<START> i thought it was an extremely clever film i was very pleased with it and truly couldn't' ask for more i actually own the film because i didn't return it to someone which i should do but i really want to keep it due to how much i enjoyed it also the fact i don't own too many foreign films and this is a first now i personally love finnish stuff so that definitely added to how much i enjoyed it but overall its worth watching however if you're not into the whole trying to understand finnish or read subtitles bit then this film is not for you br br 9 10 for sure
<START> bored and unhappy young babe zandalee a winningly sultry and vibrant performance by luscious brunette knockout erika anderson feels trapped in a stale and loveless marriage to failed poet and decent yet dull businessman thierry martin a solid and credible portrayal by judge reinhold zandalee has a torrid adulterous fling with sleazy and arrogant artist johnny collins deliciously played to the slimy hilt by nicolas cage can the relationship between thierry and zandalee be salvaged or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed director sam pillsbury and screenwriter mari kornhauser lay on the tawdry soap opera style histrionics something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences the plot goes gloriously off the rails in the laughably histrionic last third the dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar sample line i wanna shake you naked and eat you alive better still this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity the gorgeously statuesque anderson looks smoking hot in the buff and sizzling semi pornographic soft core sex scenes johnny and zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight the tart'n'tangy new orleans setting adds extra spice to the already steamy proceedings with his long scruffy black hair greasy mustache foul mouth and coarse manners cage's johnny is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing romantic lead to ever ooze his way onto celluloid the cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity anderson cage and reinhold all do respectable work with their parts with fine support from joe pantoliano as zandalee's merry flamboyant homosexual friend gerri viveca lindfors as theirry's wise perceptive mother tatta aaron neville as friendly bartender jack and steve buscemi as a funny blithely shameless thief walt lloyd's sharp and gleaming cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look the flavorsome harmonic score by pray for rain likewise hits the spot a delightfully campy and seamy riot
<START> it started out slow after an excellent animated intro as the director had a bunch of characters and school setting to develop once the bet is on though the movie picks up the pace as it's a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 pm we had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son bullies helping others mind over matter when you don't want to do something br br of special note is the girl who played erica erk hallie kate eisenberg the director kinda sneaks her in unexpectedly and when she is on screen she is captivating she's one of those hey she looks familiar faces and then i remembered that she was the little girl that pepsi featured about 8 years ago she was also in paulie that movie about the parrot who tries to find his way home br br ms eisenberg made many tv and movie appearances in '99 00 but then was not seen much for the next few years she's now 14 and is growing up to be a beautiful woman her smile really warms up the screen if she can get some more good roles she could have as good a career or better than haley joel osment another three named kid actor but hopefully without some of the problems that osment has been in lately br br anywhozitz according to my 8 y o son who just finished reading the story the film did not seem to follow the book all that well but was entertaining none the less the ending of the film seemed like a big setup for some sequels how to eat boiled slugs escargot kid's style which might not be such a bad thing it was nice to take the family to a movie and not have to worry about language violence or sex scenes br br one other good aspect of the movie was the respect fear engendered by the principal mr burdock boilerplate movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons while he has one particular goofy scene he ruled the school with a firm hand it was also nice to see andrea martin getting some work
<START> first the cgi in this movie was horrible i watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the scifi channel at the end when the owner of the park gets killed it's probably one of the worst examples of cgi i have even seen even night of the living dead had better animation br br that said the movie had almost no plot why were they on that island in particular well it wasn't stated in the movie and why would the people keep coming into the cat's area makes no sense br br one thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting in what could be called a b made for tv movie movie the acting was very good parry shen stood out in particular br br if you have absolutely nothing to do on a saturday watch this movie it may be good for some memorable quotes
<START> i had no background knowledge of this movie before i bought it but it sounded cool and i've been wanting to see a really kick butt viking movie for awhile now alas this film was not what i was looking for i had hoped for the best but instead was delivered a boring nordic soap opera that seemed to drag on too long despite its 84 minute running time the film's premise is intriguing enough it's about a viking warlord who defies his god and odin is so enraged that he curses the warlord's son named barek to death and rebirth as a berserker this barek guy is then forced to live enraged insane and violent lifetime after lifetime the movie is filmed competently enough with some rich cinematography and quasi good performances by the actors but again i found myself bored and questioning when this dribble would end the filmmakers had a chance to make something rather entertaining and semi unique but they dropped the ball perhaps it could've been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in such as gratuitous nudity and lots of gore i mean we are talking about berserkers here aren't we vikings were supposed to be bad enough what with all the raping and pillaging so aren't berserkers supposed to be even more extreme all in all unless you're a fan of the young and restless etc or are yourself in fact an insane berserker who likes self torture i'd probably steer clear of this drab piece of celluloid
<START> back in 1997 do i remember that year clinton bans cloning research the unfortunate death of princess diana the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets this was also the big year in the release of titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster i don't think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans 85 of them being teenage girls i was 12 years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong of course i grew up and didn't watch the film since i was 14 a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for 5 99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now was it worth the hype was it really the best movie of all time was that leonardo's real nose ok i know that's silly to say but i did re watch the film being completely honest here titanic is a great movie best movie of all time no just depends on your idea of a good movie but titanic delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage br br the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude wearing the heart of the ocean dated the day the titanic sank 101 year old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing she and her granddaughter elizabeth lizzy calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater in 1912 the upper class 17 year old rose boards the ship with her fiancÃ© cal hockley and her mother ruth dewitt bukater both of whom stress the importance of rose's engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt bukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upper class rose and her mother are financially broke distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern before she leaps a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first class formal dinner of the rapport building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance music and beer in third class but after cal's servant informs him of rose's whereabouts' rose is forbidden from seeing jack again however after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven year old daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea rose defies him and her mother asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean an engagement present from cal after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time they go to the deck of the ship br br they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg after overhearing the ship's lookouts discussing how serious the collision is rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal meanwhile cal discovers rose's nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jack's pocket upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him jack and rose return to the top deck cal and jack though enemies both want rose safe so they persuade her to board a lifeboat but after realizing that she cannot leave jack rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ship's first class staircase jack and rose return to the top deck the lifeboats have gone and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down br br so does titanic live up to it's hype i still say that this is a great movie to watch i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie but it has great acting amazing effects a well written story and still looks flawless love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of leo's baby face or kate's amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special it will always hold a special place in my heart it has too seeing that i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released but all that aside i do recommend this movie it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day br br 10 10
<START> this was a big disappointment for me i think this is the worst mastroianni movie ever made cosmatos tries too hard to make this movie a masterpiece and that makes this movie a typical art movie i give 4 10 for this movie
<START> this movie was so very badly written the characters had no depth they should have never made a movie of this my 11 yr old son could write a better screenplay then hyung rae shim br br the only actor that didn't suck was the zoo guard he was the only funny and believable one of the lot br br i love movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt but this one was up there on my lame list at number 2 number 1 being demonicus br br for those of you who actually thought this was a good movie you are in serious need of brain surgery br br most of the creatures in the movie weren't even dragons so why did they call d war
<START> sÃ¥ som i himmelen as above so below that very special point where divine and human meet i adore this film a gem yes amazing grace br br i was so deeply moved by its very human quality i laughed and cried through a whole register indeed several octaves of emotions br br mikael nyqvist Ã­s brilliant as daniel a first rate passionate performance charismatic and powerful his inner light and exceptional talent shines through in every scene every interaction in every meeting i was totally mesmerised enchanted and caught up the story which is our collective story the story of life itself br br the film was also so inclusive of many archetypes messiah wounded child magical child artist teacher priest abuser abused victim bully divine fool all the characters so real and true to life all awakened great fondness and compassion in me br br it is a real treat to see such a thought provoking yet thoroughly enjoyable entertaining film oh mustn't forget the heavenly choir of angels and breathtakingly beautiful sound br br thank you all this swedish film will surely captivate people world wide brilliant
<START> my roommates i nearly shorted out our tv from the numerous spit takes we did while watching this hilarious piece of 1970s self important pseudo zen dreck i'd read about this campfest for ages and scanned my local late night tv listings for years in search of this elusive turd several years ago our local abc affiliate was known for showing cool flicks for its late night weekend flick ie frogs night of the lepus etc then one day it happened at 1 40am on a saturday night over 5 years ago there it was we had over 15 folks over and the flick did not disappoint br br see andy griffith as the silliest most unthreatening bad guy since jaye davidson in stargate br br see william shatner sport a variety of things atop his head that only faintly resemble human hair or anything organic for that matter br br hear jaw droppingly inane 1970s psychobabble that makes chicken soup for the soul sound like bf skinner br br feel content that any decade was better than the 70s br br for those still reading the plot surrounds a bunch of middle class mid level a holes who decide to suck up to their s head boss griffith by joining him on a cross dessert race that spans california mexico they all wear leather jackets looking more christopher street than anything else along the way they stop at a cantina get drunk smoke joints the sight robert mike brady reed smoke a joint is an image you won't soon forget start a fight attempt rape and just act like a bunch of suburban middle class jack offs although i have an excellent copy that i taped off tv i wish this one would be released on video so the whole world could enjoy its half baked goofiness
<START> william cooke and paul talbot share director writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth and a scroungy town tramp named ralph gunnar hansen of leatherface fame wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire br br one tale is the old retread of the hook two teens on lover's lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed they stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s t as they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off one of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for christmas who can't wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about satan claus the fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies br br without a big budget for special effects campfire tales gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse a bit corny but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale the acting is understandably not award worthy cast members include tres holton courtney ballard h ray york johnny tamblyn walter kaufmann kevin draine david avin and paul kaufmann
<START> there are a few spoilers in this comment br br contrary to the comments i just read by nativetex4u and a few others i really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series br br i am a judson mills fan but also a huge chuck norris fan and while i'll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being aired br br the opening fifteen minutes with deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed i do fail to see how that many professionals weren't able to hit a moving target but the action was definitely there and deke being the hero had to survive br br as for the comment about needing to get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs this movie was not originally scheduled by cbs for a january airing and filming was completed in may of 2001 a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the u s br br if the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it maybe they would have realized the plot of the story rashid a bin laden like character planned to set off a nuclear device in the united states the president's man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem br br perhaps the writer should actually watch the movie before attempting to comment on it br br
<START> this show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on television i mean the acting is great the suspense the drama the comedy it has everything and with such a simple story a plane crashed on an island the characters are great and evangeline lilly is hot matthew fox once again shows us what a great actor he is josh holloway is so great jorge garcia is hilarious i could go on and on also the unexpected plot twists the back stories of the characters the music that is at the end of every episode j j abrahms has once again proved what an excellent writer and producer he is i mean this is better than alias and i loved alias whoever isn't watching this show should definitely consider getting the dvd's and watching it because they are missing something great this show could possibly be the best show in television history
<START> surely one of the best british films ever made if not one of the best films ever made anywhere script cinematography direction and acting in a class on their own this film works on so many levels so why is it completely unavailable on tape dvd never shown on tv why is it hidden away when it is regularly shown at the national film theatre in london to packed houses
<START> this is the second film i've seen of ida lupino as a director after 53's the hitch hiker i think this one was a better film then that one this one has a girl who is about to get married and she is then sexually assaulted and doesn't like everyone looking and talking about her so she runs away and and is taken in by a family i think leonard maltin's review is right only to give it 2 and 1 2 stars
<START> i caught this movie on ifc and i enjoyed it although i felt like the editing job was a little rough though it may have been deliberate i had a little bit of a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a little bit of a pulp fiction style non linear plot presentation it seemed a little forced though i certainly think that the movie is worth watching but i think it could have used a little cleaning up some scenes just don't seem to make sense after others br br i'm surprised to see the rating here as low as it is it's not outstanding but it doesn't have any really serious problems i gave it a 7 10 the movie did show at least that laurence fishburne can act when he wants to they must have just told him not to in the matrix movies
<START> this film is too skeletal it's a fairly low budget film i hope which excuses it somewhat but the lack of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot hurts it too much phillips is quite believable in his role as a torn apart son of a well off family who's searching for himself though his family is er well a little too white but the rest of the cast is grasping at straws every moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama and there are way too many sub plots which is an obvious sign of plot deficiency they needed filler i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who isn't either a hard core phillips fan or who has absolutely nothing to do 4 10
