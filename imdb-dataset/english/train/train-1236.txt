<START> the movie opens with a flashback to doddsville county high school on april fool's day a group of students play a prank on class nerd marty when they are punished for playing said prank they follow up with a bigger prank which par for the course in slasher films involving pranks on class nerds goes ridiculously awry leaving marty simultaneously burned by fire and disfigured by acid for the sake of being thorough fast forward five years where we find members of the student body gathering at the now abandoned high school for their five year class reunion we find out that it is no coincidence that everyone at the reunion belonged to the clique of pranksters from the flashback scene as all of the attendees are being stalked and killed by a mysterious jester mask clad murderer in increasingly complicated and mind numbingly ludicrous fashions it doesn't take sherlock holmes to solve the mystery of the killer's identity as it is revealed to be none other than a scarred marty who has seemingly been using his nerd rage and high intellect to bend the laws of physics and engineering in order to rig the school for his revenge scenario the film takes a turn for the bizarre as marty finishes exacting his revenge on his former tormentors only to be haunted by their ghosts marty is finally pushed fully over the edge and takes his own life finally the film explodes in a crescendo of disjointed weirdness as the whole revenge scenario is revealed to be a dream in the first place as marty wakes up in a hospital bed breaks free of his restraints stabs a nurse and finally disfigures his own face br br the script is tired and suffers from a terminal case of horror movie logic the only originality comes from the mind numbingly convoluted ways that the victims are dispatched the absurd it was all a dream ending feels tacked on it's almost as if someone pointed out the disjointed nature of the film and the writer decided then and there that it was a dream br br technically speaking the film is atrocious some scenes were filmed so dark that i had to pause the film and play with the color on my television the acting is sub par even for slasher films i can't help but think that casting was a part of the problem as all of the actors look at least five years older than the characters they portray which makes the flashback scene even more unintentionally laughable their lack of commitment to the movie is made obvious as half of them can't bother to keep their accents straight through the movie br br all of this being said if you like bad horror movies you might like this one too it isn't the worst film of the genre but it's far from the best
<START> before the release of george romero's genre defining night of the living dead zombies were relatively well behaved creatures they certainly had much better table manners in the old days but social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the movie going public judging by this film none whatsoever br br the story is about an expedition to cambodia whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication one of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army br br this film is basically a love triangle with zombies but seeing as this is a 30's movie the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesh eating variety we think of today they seem to respond to mind control rather than insatiable appetites and quite frankly the 'revolt' is somewhat underwhelming too the whole thing is really very dull aside from the lack of horror there isn't any over the top melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained it seems unlikely that this could've provided much entertainment even 70 years ago see it if you have to see everything with 'zombie' in the title but otherwise i would advise skipping this one
<START> lorenzo lamas stars as jack solider kelly an ex vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from backwoods rednecks atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that ron palillo is third billed and yet has 3 minutes of screen time and even those aren't any good overall a terrible movie but the scenes with lorenzo lamas and josie bell hanging from a tree bagged and gagged are worth a few unintentional laughs followed by an improved sequel
<START> i just saw dick tracy and i thought it was terrible the paintings in the background of the cities looked awful also the mob characters looked too weird warren beatty didn't do an awful job as dick tracy but it was definetely not one of his better performances madonna should just stick to singing glenne headly did a good job in this movie i gave this movie a 2 10 just because of the amazing acting by al pacino it wasn't a high note in his career but he still did a good job
<START> one of those thank god i don't live there documentaries this one tells of two warring factions in colombia guerrillas and paramilitaries and the surrounding peoples of medellin br br guns drugs and death run rampant the guys no older than 22 not in the middle of fighting a war are in jail the girls Â not women girls Â always react the same way when one of them is killed with tears and screaming you scratch your head what did they expect really i don't know what's more disturbing the nightly shoot outs and civil unrest or that everybody just seems to passively accept things as are or seeing that boy drinking what is obviously not his first beer being all of what 10 if you were to take these any of these young men out of their situation and put them some place where they had the opportunity to do more be more how many would choose not to stay br br based on this documentary all i'm afraid
<START> demi moore's character in the movie was selected for the seals because of her looks that was a bad start and the movie went down from there the plot was totally unbelievable the will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough this movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required br br trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence the differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting
<START> very smart sometimes shocking i just love it it shoved one more side of david's brilliant talent he impressed me greatly david is the best the movie captivates your attention for every second
<START> i'm a belgian and grew up in the sixties most of the us series were shown over here original language with subtitles and batman was one of the first i was keen on unfortunately over here it caused a panic hysteria amongst the mothers because batman was considered as too violent geez compare the innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays so because of my the over protective mothers from the 60s i only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes i got so frustrated i started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards still got them to compensate i even got the view master slides i had an urge to see the caped crusader all kids need some kind of hero br br years later i finally got the chance to see the re runs as an adolescent and i enjoyed it tremendously the tongue in cheek acting would have escaped me when i would've watched it as a kid but i understood it at the age of 17 yeah i've watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they haven't released the series on dvd to my knowledge br br this evening i enjoyed return to the bat cave it was a delight to watch because it was full of trivia and inside jokes to see adam and burt was a delight and this tv movie is simply fantastic in every aspect they play themselves as they played their parts in the series br br congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic feast i'm gonna watch it again my advice to all batman fans is see it rent it lend it from a friend buy it i'd never expect myself to rate this as 9 10 very well done
<START> kirstie alley looking a bit slimmer but only a bit is in this mess along with a man who is a macguyver lookalike bleached blond hair and all the premise of the movie is about an older woman 50 who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot there is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for kirstie's character and why this is included is a mystery the actor who portrays kirstie's brother is so wooden and miscast it was torture to watch their scenes what is there to say about this film avoid it
<START> i saw this movie in 1976 my first year of living in new york i went on to live there for the next 26 years but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small tv movie it was part of a pbs series as i recall and i've never forgotten it br br there are no sex scenes to speak of just delicate moving extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement all set within a conservative boston i think world war 1 environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war and did not seek out a career and financial independence frances lee mccain is superb in the role of career photographer and i have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail br br there has to be a video of this movie sure it should be on dvd but surely at least a video
<START> i have to say although this movie was formulaic throughout with a plot stolen from films like friday the 13th i know what you did last summer this movie wasn't that bad in fact it wasn't as bad as most of the horror films hollywood has released recently the killings although at times a little too imaginative were in most instances just that original the cast was mediocre which is to be expected from low budget features but much better than what that much bigger studio artisan lions gate has been offering my only real complaint that wasn't due to the film's budget which must have been small was the contrived twist ending i'm sorry but this is what put this film in the bad category for me the ending was just stupid and tacked on before that i was a little bored but actually enjoying it 4 10
<START> kol space prisoner on space death row manages to hijack a space shuttle and escape to the woods of america where he along with some new found friend try to escape from the 'alienator a female cyborg killing machine made one year after the best movie of fred olen ray's career hollywood chainsaw hookers this one can't help but feel like a bit of a letdown just as low budget as that earlier film but not nearly as fun as i had with it none of the actors really stood out at me the film is alright for the undiscriminating viewer during a rainy saturday afternoon but that's pretty much all it's good for br br my grade d br br where i saw it showtime thriller
<START> since it has been some years since i reviewed this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in dept but first some insider notes from a movie critic br br this animated series is one of those that i grew up with it made my childhood joyful it made it awesome miss some of this stuff today that we clearly don't see as much as we did back in the days well on to the review br br talespin or luftens helte which it is called in denmark is a great animated series it is much like chip and dale ducktales and a lot of those old ones so it has that weird feeling surrounding it i cannot remember this series as much as i would like to remember it br br but in my opinion it was very great it came with some kind of message not that wild of a message however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgiven br br now i don't want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons today we see something like ed edd and eddy or anything else weird like that we have all these new or nearly new shows like hannah montana or something like that yet i feel like that we don't have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days br br now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like talespin being released again to the tv screen instead of all the new ones give me back my childhood cartoons give them to the kids i have some day give them again
<START> oh man why six degrees is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone if focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions br br when i first heard of this show it didn't caught my attention at all it seemed too ordinary actually then i saw some episodes and loved it first of all the characters they are all well written and different from each other there's a alcohol addicted a woman whose fiancÃ©e cheats on her a woman who just lost her husband a driver who has a troubled brother and so on unlike what we're used to most of the characters interact with each other in casualties like in our daily routines great my favourite ones are mae carlos and whitney br br then the cast they are all great jay hernandez from hostel shows here his acting habilities in a more 3d character than his previous work as paxton the other ones give great performances too specially campbell scott who plays steven and bridget moynahan who plays whitney br br well when i came to imdb after watching some episodes i couldn't believe that it got cancelled seriously i can't understand the low ratings br br it's too bad it didn't have more than one season it would really be a good show to follow
<START> i thought i should qualify my position after reading other reviews the movie is not great but it has a lot of great elements the lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great the story is slow and weak but entertaining the acting is bad but no worse than you will find on the syfy channel the music is pretty good and the gore is good it has the great leather face in the film and is produced by bruce campbell i watched the complete movie and while mostly predictable it was still enjoyable the women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being brooding and creepy the movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence appropriate for children 13 and up there was no sex scenes i gave it 7 out of 10 and i think that is fair i would watch it again if i had nothing better to do the gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film the devil is quite creepy
<START> lost is the best tv series there is first of all it has great actors and wonderful directing the writing is a very controversial issue because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary but after season 3 the writing became highly complex for instance who is jacob why are there polar bears on the island what's the fog how did the island disappear who is richard alpert a lot of people think that the writers are lost and that they have raised a lot of questions and mysteries that they can't explain i believe these people are wrong i have confidence in the writers i think that if the mysteries are revealed from now all the charm of the series will be gone anyway lost is undeniably the greatest tv series and it will continue to be for a long time
<START> this is a german film from 1974 that is something to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond that i can't really tell you their purpose or even what the purpose of the movie is i can tell you that there's several women who also moonlight as servants at this particular castle who strip put on body paint and gyrate to bongos like they were at the goth kit kat klub though and that seems to be a good portion of the run time of this film yeah there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires and there's some girl on girl stuff etc but the main focus seems to be the painted babes gyrating away in the basement i did rather like the eye rolling of one of the main housekeepers devil worshipers that lent an authenticity to the proceedings and made her even more evil looking was that wanda the evil lesbian as billed in the credits no matter if you aren't too picky about your lesbian devil worshiping movies you might like this otherwise it's pretty dull stuff and i couldn't even finish it i was so bored 3 out of 10
<START> although i had heard this film was a little dry i watch whatever scott bakula is in at the start of this film i had high hopes for the classic cheesy but enjoyable scott gets girl ending and until 20 minutes before the end it was going great the plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very clever i kept my fingers crossed that it would work out and it would all be some horrible misunderstanding right up until when the credits rolled and i realised that there was not going to be a happy and contented ending unfortunately i was left regretting that i'd watched it and hurriedly putting on some quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the great scott
<START> as is often the case films about self loathing characters do not usually make for good drama 'downloading nancy' is no exception it's supposedly based on a true story about a woman who's murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet br br the protagonist is nancy maria bello who is married to albert rufus sewell albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar restaurants unlike most human beings albert has virtually no positive attributes except for his ability to be successful in the business world throughout the film albert has a grim and dour expression on his face he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes when his wife asks for sex he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead br br nancy is equally one note as a character not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film her self loathing takes the form of self mutilation and a result she's forced into therapy however she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made br br finally nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet he's sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot it's revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them the children's mother no longer wants anything to do with him br br nancy's plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her there's a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club it seems that louis has a two fold plan in going to see albert 1 berate him for his treatment of nancy and 2 enjoy the beating he receives it takes awhile before louis will reveal nancy's fateÂfirst he forces albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future nancy's fate of course is that louis finally ended up choking her to death but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some 'feelings' for her we soon learn that louis is imprisoned for life for nancy's murder br br what exactly are we to take away from a film such as downloading nancy are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence is that the main point of the film is sympathy for nancy actually warranted i don't think so the film's writers create a straw man in the character of albertÂsomeone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for nancy's decline but are people so one dimensional in real life i think not they have the repulsive louis a man who makes a living by inflicting pain come over and berate albert for neglecting nancy furthermore his expressions of love towards nancy before he kills her is supposed to show his 'sensitive side' br br in the end it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film they are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence that downloading nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography
<START> i admit not being that fond of oliver as a young child it's long and the story is a little slow moving because of all the musical numbers as a teenager i discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself rather than thinking of it as an adaptation of oliver twist think of it as a celebration of the classic story the adaptation is loose at best but really if you're watching a musical you ain't there for the story br br the music is the core of this movie and an overwhelming majority of it is stellar and very catchy most or all of the cast was involved in the stage version of the musical and it shows in their performances and i consider this a plus the performances are all in a more stagey style of acting typical of much older films and they are very entertaining the exception is the kid playing oliver whose job seemed to be to look cute and stay out of the real performers' way br br fagin and the dodger are the real stars of this movie oliver reed also does a fantastic job maintaining an intimidating screen presence as the menacing bill sykes even sykes' dog bullseye puts on a good performance br br this movie isn't for everyone people who hate musicals will despise it as will those who take musicals too seriously nitpicking over faulty historical details or mistaking exaggerated stage type acting for bad acting will ruin anyone's enjoyment just sit back and enjoy the entertainment it's much better if you remember that as a musical it's a fantasy loosely organized around the book not a strict adaptation
