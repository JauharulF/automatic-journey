<START> contrary to most other commentators i deeply hate this series br br it starts out looking interesting with mysterious aliens and giant robots and i kept my hopes up until the very last episode at the end of it i still didn't understand what the alien attacks were all about maybe i missed something who knows and realized that i had sat through 26 episodes consisting mainly of the characters' own self hating selfishness and self pitying it actually flips between alien robot fights and these dark depressing blinking on and off scenes where one or more characters can just say or shout i hate me you it 10 12 times in a row br br i can't really see either shinji or asuka two of the main characters showing growth or change nor can i see any of the other characters learning or growing either for that matter i wanted to kick them and tell them to get a bloody life during the first episodes and the feeling didn't change during the last ones shinji truly possesses the kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry rather than charitable and asuka is such an infuriating know it all that i wanted to smash the tv screen every time she came into view oh and more than anyone else these two hate everything and say it veeeeeeeery often br br i'm otherwise a big fan of animÃ© and manga and never before have i disliked one so much i read that the series creator writer wrote this while suffering from a depression and i can believe that it made me depressed to watch it is that the aim of this series i'm honestly asking is it designed to make the viewer confused and annoyed and if suffering from a depression why just not write a book or biography about it instead of mixing it up with aliens and mecha's this alien war plot as far as i could tell lead to absolutely nowhere br br finally since i'm truly fascinated by how many people claim to love this patchwork of dead end plots i can't help but wonder how many of them actually find it good and how many say they do because they've been told it is
<START> shaggy scooby doo get a clue it's like watching a much loved relative in the final throws of a degenerative illness clearly the work of people with no soul no love or respect for the original work what in the name of all that's holy were they thinking of it seems they were trying to go all post modern and ironic instead it's just abysmal swill what's the point in taking up a successful franchise like 'scooby doo' if you just going to flush it down the toilet my son loves the original series and even some of the spin off movies but he can't stand this drivel and let's face it you can't argue against the tastes of a seven year old
<START> i'm writing this 9 years after the final episode was aired and i am still reeling from the impact wildside has had on me br br it has effectively gone where numerous other cop dramas have gone and succeeded but it took it further and didn't stray from the realism of the streets often portraying life events and characters down to a t br br i am sorely missing this series instead we have are given the stupid underbelly which is over dramatised and acted creating a whole load of american esquire garbage br br wildside stayed true to the uniqueness of sydney and for that i am truly indebted to this wonderful series the acting was a grade and it's a shame to see only a few actors have furthered their career whilst others have faded into obscurity br br i don't want australia to forget this wonderful piece of their television history thus i ask the abc to release the complete series on dvd not the first three give this series the ending it deserves
<START> watching josh kornbluth 'act' in this movie reminds me of my freshman tv production class where the 'not funny' had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were br br obvious is the word that comes to mind when i try to synopsize this wannabe comedy the jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed the delivery is painfully bad ouch the writing is simply dorkish it is akin to a bob saget show br br watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long saturday night live skit post belushi br br i hated this movie and want my money back
<START> the sea is watching has been made from an original akira kurosawa script and it is indeed a lush and warm film watching it will be a pleasure br br kei kumai as director is certainly no equal to the old but everlasting master particularly the mass scenes in the beginning of the film has some terrible acting but the overall mood and scenery is very enjoyable another thing that is missed here kurosawa always managed to let the characters be so much more then what they are actually showing and doing br br probably that was his magic on set while shooting and just maybe this script was not fully up to par yet br br maybe we just miss the eye of the master br br this is one lovely and sweet film but it is no kurosawa to expect that might well be very silly
<START> i don't really know whether cabin fever is supposed to be a joke or a film but as far as i know it's much closer to being a joke than anything else a few years ago the community of horror film makers decided to take a new step and make fun of the genre thus giving birth to the scream series a list was given in scream of all the stupid things horror film characters will do that are predictable and the characters in scream ended up doing exactly the same things which added a lot of humor and irony to this analysis of the genre and led to hope that horror films from now on would show a bit different either full of irony towards the genre self derision towards the film itself or at least different in their dramatic process than all the old films that responded to the same tired criteria in seeing cabin fever alas many will see how unoriginal serious pretentious boring and even not scary some supposedly scary films are now even a few years later first of all this film lacks originality in a way few others do it has been said several times how little imagination horror directors have today remaking remakes of foreign sequels but setting the film in a cabin in the woods just doesn't seem to be an hommage to anything it seems to be simply a ripoff whoever wishes to be surprised by other factors of the film's story won't be once again we are dealing with a film whose characters are all in their early twenties who won't think rationally when placed in front of a problem will rather argue for hours and pick up fights than try to think and do something about it not much excitement there either for the umpteenth time in a horror film they are tempted to kiss make love and just basically have fun all sorts of things that don't really make them any different than any other horror film victims seen previously secondly this film is unimaginatively serious every situation the characters are in every dialog every situation in the film is treated with such seriousness that any viewer with a little sense of derision will be relieved when some characters finally end up dying nothing in the way the film is directed written or acted shows any sign of humor or sarcasm which is quite amazing considering the film is about an invisible never heard of before flesh eating virus no laughs please i won't even bring up the acting since there are no actors in this film the cast was most certainly hired for being friends or neighbors with the director thirdly and this will strike whoever has seen a good horror film before the screenplay is absolutely empty nothing really happens some actions are repeated several times let's try to get help nothing makes sense either in the facts the psychology of the characters or even the hilariously lame last sequence of the film which is probably supposed to be funny according to the director and screenwriters in the end i will only remark that a horror film is supposed to have something scary in it gallons of fake blood whether they are being vomited squirted from severed limbs or simply dripping from wounds never were enough to scare an audience such major features as screenplay ideas and even cruelty are requested for whoever claims to have shot something scary if i wasn't considering it to be a total failure i would agree to reckon that the film has one talent it is filthy disgusting to watch yet being grossed out and being scared are two very different feelings let it be known br br i would like to encourage anyone a tad curious or interested in seeing this film to check older major horror films first why not from the 60s the 70s the 80s films made by wes craven dario argento sam raimi stanley kubrick david lynch roger corman william lustig john carpenter it might not only give a good definition of what is scary or self derisory horror but also convince viewers that new isn't necessarily better a good example related to the film is the few tracks composer angelo badalamenti provided for this film even although they are unmistakably close to his previous compositions they are below anything he has ever done before
<START> i have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the wrinkle in time chronicles my dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading a winkle in time and would think what an amazing movie this would make sadly enough that screenwriter failed changing characters throwing in lame humor and all out destroying the plot i know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie but why can't you stay true to the book why must you change the way characters think and act for those of you who have not read the book pick it up find a soft couch and let your imagination run wild
<START> this film is really only bill maher's interpretation of religion there are several funny moments and some interesting points but don't go into this expecting an even handed discussion of religion this is what i consider to be the worst kind of documentary everything is arranged ahead of time and in editing to provide you with the opinion of the director rather than letting you make your own decision br br editing it's very chopped up inter spliced with clips from pop culture and the media to reinforce the point the interviewee barely has a chance to finish a sentence before he is interrupted by the editing the only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what bill maher wants them to say once someone deviates from the gospel according to maher they get edited br br interviewees they are meant to represent the absolute most extremist religions from the tv evangelical to the ultimate jewish stereotype to a truck stop chapel seriously a truck stop chapel he's picked the worst money grabbers the heavy extremists and those who don't have the budget to say no to pick on and when he does get a good person to interview he edits the hell out of them br br stereotyping all religions are portrayed as stereotypes especially hard hit are the muslims during the muslim segment he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before interrupting them either himself or through editing in pieces with suicide bombers all muslims are portrayed as gun toting extremists through the editing and none of the people interviewed is edited fairly br br ending the message at the end is incredibly heavy handed and while it is an interesting idea it's not presented with fairness to the countless people who are not religious extremists bill maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground this literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and that it will destroy the world he also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid br br with the faults to the film it has some good points and the humor while very unfair is actually funny but know going in it is a very one sided view bill maher's view of religion he's not discovering anything he's telling you what he thinks br br 4 10 some good moments but heavy handed with an extremely irresponsible documentary style
<START> i watched the show 10 years ago and loved it am now in possession of the dvd and was watching the series and waiting for scenes i knew were in the show when lucas confronts gail in his house and realized it was missing all of a sudden i was watching the seduction without the lead up then i went on line to check out all the bios of the stars and came across the comments about the shows being out of order thank you but there seems to be some conflict some comments state strangler number 19 then triangle 20 when another had them around the other way and also potato boy 5 and dead to the world 6 were reversed as well can someone clarify
<START> the girl from missouri arrives in new york city knowing exactly what she wants to amount to something solid by marrying a millionaire without losing her virginity with her knockout good looks she quickly catches the eye of the playboy son of a tycoon but by staying true to her virtue will she also discover true love br br jean harlow sizzles in this excellent little comedy with her platinum hair gorgeous accouterments she is a dazzler but her beauty should not obscure the fact that she was also a very good actress she has rightfully earned her spot at the very top of the hollywood pantheon br br an excellent cast gives harlow fine support lionel barrymore as the wily old tycoon wise to harlow's ways handsome franchot tone as his son smitten with love raucous patsy kelly stealing her scenes as harlow's sidekick debonair alan mowbray as a well mannered english lord elderly clara blandick as barrymore's feisty secretary hearty hale hamilton as a rich man with an eye for the ladies muscular nat pendleton as a lifeguard who catches kelly's flirtatious eye and lewis stone unforgettable in a small role as a bankrupted businessman br br it should be noted that this film was produced soon after hollywood's production code was instituted a comparison with red headed woman made two years earlier would be fascinating in which harlow's character goes after the same ends but uses very different means
<START> i loved this movie it is rare to get a glimpse of post partum vietnam and this movie sans combat scenes and exciting bombs and gunfire did it i had no idea i'd be so affected by it what an amazing look at how alien vets feel it was tough to watch quite frankly we all understand the fighting and the apocalypse now type of drama but this is so so different what happens when they come back and try to live a life they can't it made me very aware of a large group of men that are rattling around lost in america not able to relate can't sleep can't have love affairs can't deal with normal society they feel totally apart this is a huge tragedy and one that isn't addressed enough yeah we've changed our attitude about vietnam vets we like them now but so what it doesn't seem to have made any difference to them it's too late so it was a great film but i cried a lot i have no other criticisms
<START> i'm 14 years old and i love this cartoon burt reynolds and dom deluise make a great pair this movie is really funny and i love the songs my favorite songs are you can't keep a good dog down and that song about sharing i think it's called what's mine is yours this was the last movie with judith barsi who played the voice of anne marie my favorite character is charlie but i find itchy's voice is so fun to hear although some scenes i actually found scary i still have a hard time watching the scene with charlie's dream and carface scares the crap out of me other characters like king gator i found really funny the ending was adorable and was actually sad made me cry a little i give this movie 7 10
<START> my favorite movie genre is the western it's really the only movie genre that is of american origin and despite sergio leone no one does them quite like americans br br right at the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is winchester 73 it was the first pairing and only black and white film of the partnership of director anthony mann and actor james stewart it was also a landmark film in which stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a straight salary from universal many such deals followed for players making them as rich as the moguls who employed them br br anthony mann up to this point had done mostly b pictures noir type stuff with no real budgets just before winchester 73 mann had done a fine western with robert taylor devil's doorway that never gets enough praise i'm sure james stewart must have seen it and decided mann was the person he decided to partner with br br in this film mann also developed a mini stock company the way john ford was legendary for besides stewart others in the cast like millard mitchell steve brodie dan duryea john mcintire jay c flippen and rock hudson would appear in future mann films br br it's a simple plot james stewart is obsessed with finding a man named dutch henry brown and killing him why i won't say but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of james stewart on screen anthony mann reached into jimmy stewart's soul and dragged out some demons all of us are afraid we have br br the hate is aptly demonstrated in a great moment towards the beginning of the film after stewart and sidekick millard mitchell are disarmed by wyatt earp played by will geer because guns aren't carried in earp's dodge city there's a shooting contest for a winchester rifle in dodge city and the betting favorite is dutch henry brown played with menace by stephen mcnally stewart mitchell and geer go into the saloon and stewart and mcnally spot each other at the same instant and reach to draw for weapons that aren't there look at the closeups of stewart and mcnally they say more than 10 pages of dialog br br another character stewart runs into in the film is waco johnny dean played by dan duryea who almost steals the film this may have been duryea's finest moment on screen he's a psychopathic outlaw killer who's deadly as a left handed draw even though he sports two six guns br br another person stewart meets is shelley winters who's fiancÃ© is goaded into a showdown by duryea and killed her best scenes are with duryea who's taken a fancy to her she plays for time until she can safely get away from him guess who she ultimately winds up with br br there are some wonderful performances in some small roles there ain't a sour note in the cast john mcintire as a shifty indian trader jay c flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and rock hudson got his first real notice as a young indian chief even john alexander best known as 'theodore roosevelt' in arsenic and old lace has a brief but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both mcnally and stewart stop at different times br br mann and stewart did eight films together five of them westerns and were ready to do a sixth western night passage when they quarreled and mann walked off the set the end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films
<START> i avoided watching this film for the longest time long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over hyped over blown overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz and i wanted nothing to do with it i never watched it in the theatre i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards even though i had never seen it then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest one of the girls spoke about this movie it was so great she said you really felt like you were on the ship nonsense i thought i shared my feelings with my fellow judges one looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real titanic the movie must have done something right to get her so interested well maybe thought i then it finally appeared on pay tv ok i thought i'll give it a look see i didn't want to like it and i didn't i loved it what a great movie br br where to start first the directing my high school public speaking contestant was right james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic you don't just watch it you really do feel it then the performances the lead performances from kate winslet as rose and leonardo dicaprio as jack are excellent winslet's being the superior i thought but both were good they had their rich girl poor boy characters down to a perfect t i thought in my opinion though stealing the show was frances fisher as rose's mother she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack then the details i'm no expert on the sinking of the titanic but i have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance very impressive indeed then the song who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dion's performance of my heart goes on br br problems well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that i just don't accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class i know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed i thought when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats br br a minor quibble though this is truly an excellent movie my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre where i think it would have been so much more impressive br br 9 10
<START> i like many die hard trekkers or trekkies i don't care suffered through seven seasons of star trek voyager dreaming of a better show when it was over lamenting the end of deep space nine in 1999 prayers answered enterprise is fantastic fresh perspective radically different characters stunning new visuals a pop song for the intro i was shocked i can't think of anything i didn't like sign me up for 10 seasons of this show star trek is back voyager nobody misses you keep on trekkin' br br
<START> the amazing mr williams stars melvyn douglas who did five films in 1939 one of which was ninotchka with garbo his co star was joan blondell maxine who also did five films that year three of which they made together douglas is lt williams and he and his co horts are presented with a dead body and they must figure out what really happened viewers will recognize his co workers the actors clarence kolb donald macbride don beddoe always played positions of authority senators bank presidents policemen this who dunnit has a flair of comedy to it the policemen are always throwing jabs at each other and even williams and his girlfriend are battling verbally some fun gags williams even takes the man they arrested along on a date with his girlfriend there's a lot of fun stuff in here so get past the slow beginning and wait for the funnier stuff later on don't want to give away any spoilers so you'll have to catch it on turner classic movies director alexander hall made mostly comedies and was reportedly engaged to lucy at some point
<START> if it were not for the oh so gourgous natassia malthe this b movie would not have been worth one sector of my tivo disk space in what low rent back lot warehouse was the supposed space port filmed in continuity people it's a basic principle in real movie making by night an alleged space port and by day night and day on a space station a warehouse people please the only thing i will commend this movie for is the wardrobe dept for continuously keeping natassia in those tight shape revealing outfits even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the outfits that she obviously spent some time getting into each day of filming the sci fi channel would have been better off showing spaceballs at least there would have been some real humor in watching something so unbelievable br br p s michael ironside please fire your agent asap you are so much better of an actor to be even associated with this level of movie making
<START> run away from this movie even by b movie standards this movie is dreadful it is also insidious in it's theme the main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are cool and worth admiring people who treat others with respect are losers guncrazy is a movie that speaks for the disenfranchised a lot better than this movie see it instead br br no normal kid would do what trent does state troopers do not work as they do in this film etc seeing this movie makes you realize why writers use the hooker with a heart of gold cliche mija is a completely unsympathetic hooker who yes has had a terrible life however she is such a terrible person the audience cannot identify with her br br usually there is one thing a movie can be recommended for in this case there is none it is such a ridiculous movie it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters the acting is adequate by b movie standards and the direction presents nothing new or interesting
<START> the cover of the box makes this movie look really good don't be fooled splatter university came out in 1984 which was the last good year for horror but this movie sucks the characters are so annoying only the teacher is cool there is like no plot to this movie who the hell would ever produce this waste of a film br br spoilers up ahead br br the teacher dies in this and it was a female we all know that we must have a female surviver if you're going to break the rules do it in a good horror flick not this waste
<START> this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen it is not funny it is not interesting and should not have been made
