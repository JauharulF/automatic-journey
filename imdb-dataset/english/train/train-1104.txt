<START> of the three remakes on w somerset maughan's novel this one is the best one and not particularly because what john cromwell brought to the film the film is worth a look because of the break through performance by bette davis who as mildred rogers showed the film industry she was a star finally her struggles with jack warner and his studio paid off royally br br the film is dominated by mildred from the start we realize from the beginning that mildred doesn't care for philip and never will she doesn't hide her contempt for this kind soul that has fallen in love with the wrong woman he will be humiliated by mildred again and again as she makes no bones about what she really is br br poor philip carey besides of being handicap is a man who is weak when he tries to cling onto mildred she rejects him it is when mildred returns to him when she is frail and defeated that he rises to the occasion overcoming his own dependency on this terrible woman who has stolen his will and his manhood br br bette davis gives a fantastic portrayal of mildred this was one of her best roles and she ran away with it her disgust toward the kind philip is clear from the onset of their relationship when she tells him she washes her mouth after he kisses her is one of the most powerful moment in the movie leslie howard underplayed philip and makes him appear even weaker than he is frances dee reginald denny alan hale and reginald owen are seen in minor roles br br this is bette davis show and don't you forget it
<START> i first saw ice age in the subiaco cinemas when it came out back in '02 i was only 13 at the time but even then i liked it it had some sort of warmth br br we've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it it never gets boring this is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3d animations made at the time the characters have no particular 'home' which they leave they are nomads and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch br br also each individual character on the surface appear to be just putting up with each other but they're really all good friends as well all of the characters have their own charms even the bad guys sid the sloth is charming in his annoying over affectionate and naive sort of way manny is adorable in his depressed reclusive character and so on and so forth br br another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation all the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay giving the film an artistic edge br br another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie is that gender means very little there are hardly any female characters but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film due to this there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age br br all in all ice age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before shrek 2 and the incredibles came out
<START> one of the most heart warming foreign films i've ever seen br br the young girl is an amazing talent stellar performances by her doggie the old man the king of masks and liang the living boddhisatva br br spoiler the deplorable treatment of children especially females is disturbing br br loved the music the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story br br this is a must see enjoyable family film although not for very young children would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version
<START> moonwalker is absolutely incredible what else can i say michael jackson is the true king of pop rock and soul moonwalker has everything great story line fantastic music great visual effects and of course it has michael jackson
<START> as the celebration of christmas has evolved through the years whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other that has somehow slipped past one ebenezer scrooge merchant and money lender in 19th century london br br as his nephew points out to his uncle he doesn't keep christmas in any way because scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug the humanity in scrooge was driven out long ago he's a hard case a whole lot like his 20th century counterpart mr potter of bedford falls new york br br but as charles dickens told this tale redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit scrooge and show him how br br a christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century great britain as oliver twist was the characters in this film are middle and lower class the cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in oliver twist but they are having to struggle to stay up there still love and happiness radiate their home no thanks to the guy bob cratchit works for br br like george bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much ebenezer scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world br br patrick stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of scrooge but george c scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film the meanness of him but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change scott joins a fine tradition of people like reginald owen and alastair sim who've both done great interpretations of scrooge br br among the supporting roles i particularly enjoyed david warner as bob cratchit and edward woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of christmas present br br according to imdb this is one of 32 versions of a christmas carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best
<START> that is the only thing i can positive to say about this movie cleveland is the star i've been there and never saw the city look this good beautiful river and cityscapes br br this movie moves ahead at such a pace they hope you won't notice the lack of real world relevance people running around and shooting guns without any consequence for example there is a shoot out at rob lowe's character's house two cars are stolen and yet the cops don't show up there till much later in the movie murder for hire never looked so implausible br br whoever wrote this movie should be on the receiving end of one the movies countless stray bullets many of the actors in this movie are so much better than this i check the date of the movie just to make sure it wasn't written during the writers strike but alas this was not the case this movie is currently in rotation on universal's hd channel unless you want to drool of over lowe there is no reason to watch it
<START> i thought this move was very good there were a few things that were less than perfect but overall i was quite surprised the courtroom scene in the end seemed a little unrealistic but was real enough to be entertaining i found that the movie communicated the hardships of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it being a military pilot i could relate to many of these parts
<START> spoilers this is a gripping movie about grifters but who is conning who here when does the hunter turn into the prey this gritty dark movie is slow moving and seductive it pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path only to waylay you just as you think you are safe br br it has a riveting script with good acting at least from the leads i didn't notice the background music but it was never jarring so it must have been done right br br i was very surprised that i liked this movie because i don't usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end
<START> bela lugosi is great as usual but the movie is nothing compared to dracula he is probably the only one that played a perfect part in this movie but not even a legend like lugosi could save the badness of the idea of this movie and unlike most old unspenseful horror films this movie doesn't set the mood very well even at its worst any of bela's movies is only mediocre though
<START> okay the recent history of star trek has not been good the next generation faded in its last few seasons ds9 boldly stayed where no one had stayed before and voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise so when they announced a new star trek series i did not have high expectations and the first episode broken bow did have some problems but overall it was solid trek material and a good romp br br i'll get the nits out of the way first the opening theme is dull and i don't look forward to sitting through it regularly but that's what remotes are for what was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room they need to cut that nonsense out br br but the plot was strong and moved along well the characters though still new seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect the vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before with a slightly ominous theme i particularly liked the linguist who is the first star trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears they seemed to stay true to trek lore something that has been a significant problem in past series though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields the instant invention of technology that can fix anything and the inevitable plethora of time travel stories anyone want to start a pool on how long before the borg show up br br all in all the series has enormous potential they are seeing the universe with fresh eyes we have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series how did the klingons go from just insulting to war how did we meet the romulans how did the federation form and just who put earth in charge why is the prime directive so important if they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes this will be an interesting series br br my favorite line zephram cochran saying where no man has gone before not no one

<START> dark angel is a futuristic sci fi series set in post apocalyptic seattle centering on max jessica alba a genetically enhanced young woman on the run from her creators br br the dark angel universe is absorbing not as much as say buffy but absorbing nonetheless with an interesting and believable set of characters certainly it is not for everyone but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable series out there dark angel is criminally overlooked and under rated and was unfortunatly canceled after only 2 series which was a great shame as this had the potential to become a great series although its 42 episodes are only 10 shy of long running bbc sci fi comedy red dwarf as it is dark angel remains unfinished so seek it out and if you want more lobby fox to make another series
<START> this long winded film turns out to be less about berkowitz and his effect on nyc but more about painting caricatures of a certain group of italian americans known locally as guidos the problem is that guidos are uninteresting no matter what kind of story or setting they are immersed in they are already living caricatures so lee only amplifies them rather than simply portraying them br br when someone has a caricature done of themselves they don't go home and say hey let's make the ears and nose even bigger that's what lee has done in this film the most interesting characters in the film are the two adrian brody and jennifer esposito who wish to escape the guido lifestyle top it off with an uninteresting storyline for the characters particularly john leguizamo's and you get a nice film to fall asleep by especially considering it's lengthy run time br br one more strike against it for someone proclaiming to be a yankees fan and has grown up in new york spike lee should know how to spell phil rizzuto which is spelled incorrectly in the closing credits
<START> i'm into bad movies but this has nothing going for it despite what the morons above have said it is not funny i know comedy and underground movies but this is so boring that the director writer should be prohibited from ever directing anything but local cable access ever again to love movies and comedy is to despise this film i may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was if you like this movie you are a pothead as sober there is nothing here zero if you need to compare underground movies see kentucky fried movie or early john waters the movie starts by defining satire and i defy anyone to show me the satire the rule for comedy is this if it's funny you can say or do anything but if it's not funny you are not satirical you are not edgy you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny zero
<START> i was utterly disappointed by this movie i had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations i expected a drama with more intense character development but that never happens in the movie daniel day lewis is a good actor but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe i tought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie i would rate his performance 6 out of 10 br br acting 6 out of 10 direction is 5 out of 10 script is the worst 2 out of 10 br br i deleted the movie from my dvr at 70 mins into the movie much better movies out there than this
<START> why is this movie not in the 250 best this movie looks still astoundingly fresh 56 years after its production but it could only have been made at the aftermath of w w ii because of the perception of the nearness of death people were more aware that life could be stopped at one unexpected moment and what after life i liked the scene at the end with the judgment and all people of all nations gathered the phlegmatic judge abraham sofaer a typical british judge doctor reeves roger livesey defending peter carter david niven and also june kim hunter against the american prosecutor abraham farlan raymond massey i there is a reason why it is an american it is all so imaginative michael powell wrote directed and produced this astonishing movie which is a real tour de force the message of the movie is clear in the universe the law is the most important but on earth nothing goes beyond the love between humans the way in which this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any hollywood movie could ever make
<START> i thought this was an utterly charming film the story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of john waters pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places edward furlong does well in the lead but the best performances are by his grandmother mink stole a hilarious cameo and of all people patty hearst i think the reviewers are way off base on this one they seem to be taking pecker's worst valuation of his work as gospel when i think the film pretty clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist
<START> we have all been asking ourselves why don't they remake the slasher films that were only ok instead of remaking the ones that were great already that way they can only make it better well with prom night they have remade the average but trashy fun 80s jamie lee curtis film and made it even worse its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens hence no violence etc the knife in this slasher flick is blunt the director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window the cast who include britney snow who was superb in hairspray try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared more annoying is how the death scenes are handled we will hear the attack but wont see it it also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered im guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids yet in pours the money from americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office slasher movies are a lot of fun but in prom nights case it made me want to download the original i've seen scarier oc and dawsons creek episodes
<START> how sad to see the beautiful and talented tina louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a film tina still looked fit and attractive but for some reason seems truly frightened i can understand her fear fearing that this 3rd rate stinker would somehow be released to the general public also i'm a fan of the likable adam west again as with tina adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age his acting here is passable but the script is so bad that it's difficult to even listen to the dialog br br the movie is a rip off of the classic brando biker flick the wild ones out law biker gang is out of control in a small hick town the bikers here look like a motley group and i sure wouldn't want them to date my sister the acting is stiff and wooden and the story plot is as old as sand hellriders is hell to watch
<START> docteur petiot starring michel serrault is a brutal story about a brutal man a doctor who heals the sick in occupied france even if their ability to compensate is not there yet he preys on the weakest amidst the populace the imagery and cinematography are superb and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story he is the perfect psychopath seductive and altruistic intelligent and caring calculating and murderous a movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer kudos to mr serrault for his chilling portrayal
