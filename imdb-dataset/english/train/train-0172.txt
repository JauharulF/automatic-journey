<START> kurt thomas stars as jonathan cabot some kind of a gymnast who trains for a special game which involves being hunted by a group of ninjas but those ninjas won't stand a chance especially since cabot is a gymnast taken as a whole gymkata is one helluva bad movie the atrocious acting the god awful script and really incompetent directing make the quality below human standards however this movie is so terrible it becomes really really funny i mean with dialog such as i know i'll outsleep them or ha your through only add to the mock value that gymkata more then obtains besides it's wisely the only movie that has are hero a gymnast who finds things to swing on in the heat of the moment
<START> i had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summer the end result was just two scenes in the movie the location was sylvan lake in the black hills bring the wagon stop the wagon etc so this dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed the local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real yes doris animals were hurt during filming i think the ending was copied by jack nicholson in the shining a great western social comment from the 50's this should be in the same class as high noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like blackboard jungle or rebel without a cause was for 50's youth
<START> i saw this in the theater and i instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video i am a big nut for sci fi action flicks though anyway br br without giving any of the story away it is worth seeing if you like sci fi without requiring much thought the story is basic and the plot is very good worth your time to see br br maybe they will make a sequel br br 8 out of 10
<START> based on elmore leonard this is a violent and intelligent action film the story a business man is blackmailed by some 3 criminals roy schieder does great job as the leading character and special credit's got to go to john glover who plays sort of a naughty psychopath i must mention that the villains characters are very complex and interesting something that is very rare for an action film also features some beautiful and sexy women most notable are kelly preston as the young bate for schieder's character vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three blackmailers i'm glad to say that ann margaret still hasn't lost it this lady is a true babe don't look at the rate of this film i really don't know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and under rated film you will enjoy it that's a promise recommended a
<START> at the name of pinter every knee shall bow especially after his nobel literature prize acceptance speech which did little more than regurgitate canned by the numbers sixth form anti americanism but this is even worse not only is it a tour de force of talentlessness a superb example of how to get away with coasting on your decades old reputation but it also represents the butchery of a superb piece the original sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind yes it was a theatrical confection and it is easy to see how it's central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen but it still worked terrifically well this is a michael caine vanity piece but let's face it caine is no olivier not only can he not fill larry's shoes he couldn't even fill his bathroom slippers the appropriately named caine is after all a distinctly average actor whose only real recommendation like so many british actors is their longevity in the business he was a good harry palmer excellent in get carter but that's yer lot mate give this a very wide berth and stick to the superb original this is more of a half pinter
<START> this movie is a great the plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by mark twain the movie starts of with a scene where hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called when you stub your toe on the moon it reminds me of sinatra's song high hopes it is fun and inspirational the music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the king hank bing crosby and sir saggy sagamore overall a great family movie or even a great date movie this is a movie you can watch over and over again the princess played by rhonda fleming is gorgeous i love this movie if you liked danny kaye in the court jester then you will definitely like this movie
<START> this is a bad b movie masquerading as a mockumentary the porn documentary filmmaker in the movie has almost as much screen time and dialog as any other character that completely destroyed any documentary feel that they may have wanted to create br br the fact that the film is not actually a mockumentary is the least of it's problems the film is not funny the film is not sexy the film doesn't have anything insightful to say about the porn business it's not even particularly salacious while there's simulated sex the amount of nudity is mild for an r rated film br br someday someone will make a good mockumentary about the porn industry this is not it
<START> i could name plenty of funny movies there are comedies that set out to be funny and are some movies like a gymkata for example try to be serious but end up funny the ladies man is a film that is desperately trying to be funny but could not be less funny if it was about a guy who got a lot of chicks in the middle of the wreckage of a nuclear holocaust it's anti funny br br i don't think i laughed harder than a chuckle at anything in this movie it's simply unfunny it's boring stupid inane annoying mind bogglingly bad but not funny i don't particularly care for tim meadows or this character from snl but i expected better than this br br the movie is completely lacking logic or common sense it's like the script writer had a bag over his head while he was typing and he couldn't see which keys he was hitting they tell the origin of the ladies man but fail to include a motivation for his bizarre fascination with acting like it's still the seventies the movie tries to get humor out of a man who appears to pleasuring himself to porn shortly after he tried to hang himself this is comedy i like to consider myself having a pretty keen sense of humor spending a lot of time writing comedy as i do but maybe i'm just not quite bright enough for this film br br lee evans so funny as tucker in there's something about mary is outrageously bad here i was pleading with him in my head to shut up br br by the end i was pounding on my chair muttering under my breath and had the film gone on any longer would probably have attempted suicide this film might not be as bad as battlefield earth but it's the first movie i've seen that's come close br br
<START> the memory banks of most of the reviewers here must've short circuited when trying to recall this cubic zirconia of a gem because practically everyone managed to misquote lloyd bochner's walter thornton when in a fit of peevish anger he hurls the phallic garden nozzle at his new wife jerilee randall thornton a nearly comatose pia zadora which was used to sexually assault her earlier in the movie but i'm getting ahead of myself in any case poor lloyd could've been snarling that line at the speechless audience as much as he was his put upon co star br br hard as it is for most of us to believe especially these days nobody in hollywood sets out to intentionally make a bad movie this is certainly not the most defensible argument to make since there just seem to be so damn many of them coming out but then again there is that breed of film that one must imagine during the time of its creation from writing casting and direction must've been cursed with the cinematic equivalent of trying to shoot during the ides of march br br the lonely lady is in that category and represents itself very well considering the circumstances here we have all the ingredients in a recipe guaranteed to produce a monumentally fallen soufflÃ© pia zadora a marginal singer actress so determined to be taken seriously that she would take on practically anything that might set her apart from her peers which this movie most certainly did a somewhat high profile novel written by the trashmaster himself harold robbins of the carpetbaggers and dreams die first fame a cast who probably thought they were so fortunate to be working at all that they tried to play this dreck like it was clifford odets or ibsen plus a director who more than likely was a hired gun who kept the mess moving just to collect a paycheck and was probably contractually obligated not to demand the use of the 'alan smithee' moniker to protect what was left of his reputation like lamont johnson's lipstick meir zarchi's i spit on your grave roger vadim's barbarella paul verhoeven's showgirls or the grandmammy of really bad film making frank perry's mommy dearest the lonely lady is still often discussed usually with disgust disbelief horrified laughter or a unique combination of all three yet also defies dissection description or even the pretzel logic of hollyweird nobody's sure how it came to be how it was ever released in even a single theater or why it's still here and nearly impossible to get rid of but take it or leave it it is here to stay and i don't think that lovers of really good bad movies would have it any other way
<START> kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness the plot is so contrived and unbelievable starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people including clergy involved in what is a crime everywhere next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces a very unpleasant and coo coo mother aided abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends moving the setting from an island off the coast of south carolina did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget the very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service kim basinger whom i do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads i thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all the movie i kept surfing back and forth to had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much unless you like an unbelievable story wooden acting a contorted mixture of religious mythological allegory my advice is to skip this one oh and maybe a small carping criticism but wouldn't a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat the best part of this movie is the scenery
<START> i rented this film to see what might be a bloody non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action drama that makes kickboxer look like die hard lou and reb are in vietnam and as lou saves reb from the gooks he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever the vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard i swear lou is now brain damaged and reb and him live together and own a bar super homoerotic lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and reb goes on a killing spree to get him back there is no good fight scenes at all the punches are two inches away from a person characters personalities change in matter of seconds one guy is a bad and in the next scene he's good the acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental frank stallone sounding song that would make you sick i hated this film
<START> if you loved long way round you will enjoy this nearly as much it is educational funny interesting and tense charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates two tired mechanics two excellent cameramen and too much russ ewan makes a few appearances but charley really pulls it off alone he is funny engaging and still a puddle of stress and doubt great stuff br br the series wraps up in 7 episodes like lwr the preparation is nearly as interesting as the race though they cover the ins and outs of the race well there could be a bit more explanation of the trucks and cars which are merely mentioned and rarely even seen racing it is a motorcycle movie though and anyone on two wheels will love this br br the series features stunning photography as well as a few interviews of peoples mouths yikes there is another extremely catchy theme song like lwr but this one is not nearly as good as the stereophonics br br if you live in the us god knows when it will be released so buy it on amazon uk and watch it on your computer as i did oh and be prepared to buy another motorbike
<START> i caught this movie on sci fi before heading into work if you've any interest in seeing dean cain dive and avoid being enveloped in flames at least a dozen times this movie is for you if that doesn't peak your interest well i'm afraid you'll wish that you were the one about to be enveloped in flames because this movie is pretty bad the acting to begin with is awful awful awful the characters are all completely obnoxious and the dialogue is worse than your typical z grade sci fi movie towards the end the movie began to remind me of 'hollow man' complete with escape via elevator shaft except with a dragon not a naked invisible man unlike other similar flicks however this one wasn't even awesomely bad it was just plain bad
<START> it's not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered but 1969's midnight cowboy is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time directed by john schlesinger and written by waldo salt the movie seems to be a product of its time the late 1960's when american films were especially expressionistic but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period the film's cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in ang lee's brokeback mountain br br the meandering plot follows joe buck a naive young texan who decides to move to manhattan to become a stud for hire for rich women full of energy but lacking any savvy he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances he meets a cynical sickly petty thief named ratso rizzo who first sees joe as an easy pawn the two become dependent on one another and rizzo begins to manage joe things come to a head at a psychedelic drug infested party where joe finally lands a paying client meanwhile rizzo becomes sicker and the two set off for florida to seek a better life this is not a story that will appeal to everyone in fact some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic br br in his first major role jon voight is ideally cast as he brings out joe's paper thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities as rizzo dustin hoffman successfully upends his clean post college image from the graduate and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to joe the honesty of their portrayals is complemented by schlesinger's film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the times square district at the time the director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character's fragile psyches credit also needs to go to salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story the other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters including brenda vaccaro as the woman joe meets at the party sylvia miles as a blowsy matron john mcgiver as a religious zealot and barnard hughes as a lonely out of towner br br the two disc 2006 dvd package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer jerome hellman since unfortunately neither schlesinger nor salt are still living there are three terrific featurettes on the second disc a look back documentary after midnight reflections on a classic 35 years later which features comments from hellman hoffman voight and others as well as clips and related archive footage such as voight's screen test controversy and acclaim which examines the genesis of the movie's initial 'x' rating and public response to the film and a tribute to the director celebrating schlesinger
<START> i will always have a soft spot for this disney flick another of their part live action part animation entries that sought to recreate the success of mary poppins and never quite made it when i was in grade school every once in a while we would have a movie day where the whole school would crowd into the cafeteria and a movie would be projected the old fashioned way multiple reels and all at the time it seemed like a momentous occasion whenever this day arrived and bedknobs and broomsticks is one of the movies i can remember seeing this way br br and from what i remember it's quite charming angela lansbury never put her name to anything that wasn't at least competent and she's winning here as a witch with a magic bed boy that could be misconstrued couldn't it who can take her and a couple of young kids on magic adventures to far off places come on what kid wouldn't want a bed like that br br grade a
<START> when a small town is threatened by a child killer a lady police officer goes after him by pretending to be his friend as she becomes more and more emotionally involved with the murderer her psyche begins to take a beating causing her to lose focus on the job of catching the criminal not a film of high voltage excitement but solid police work and a good depiction of the faulty mind of a psychotic loser
<START> holy cow what a piece of sh t this movie is i didn't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie i guess they didn't know either i don't remember any farting or belching in the book do you br br they took this all times childrens classic added some farting belching and sexual inuindo and prostituted it into a kaka joke this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like i have to say visually it was interesting but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor if you even think that kind of thing is funny i don't want the kids that i know to think it is br br don't take your kids to see don't rent the dvd i hope the ghost of doctor suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie
<START> this is the crappiest film i have ever seen but in all fairness it's watchable and rather funny i don't think the film makers intended it to be your typical hollywood blockbuster quality it's just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow as it's the middle of winter he then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it's own this film is really stupid but it's funny the killings are hilarious i wouldn't advise you to go and buy it like i did the cover looked good but if it happens to be on tv one night and you're up for a laugh then stick it on
<START> i do have the guts' to inform you to please stay away from dahmer' the biographical film based on the real life story of the grotesque serial killer dahmer' strays more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject jeffrey dahmer who murdered over 15 young males and ate some of their body parts was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation however the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to greenlight this awful dahm' project this is not an easy film to digest even though jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery brainsadillas' appetizers or even some real life mr potato skins' failure
