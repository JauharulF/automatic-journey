<START> okay i was bored and decided to see this movie but i think the main thing that brought this movie down was that there would be a hour of footage then basically that same hour repeated 4 times it consists of 1 gathering the troops and discussing the attack plan 2 flashbacks to the men's wives 3 the approach of the troops marching in a long line 4 men running up hill and shooting usually the first getting shot in the head then 3 other men rescuing him 5 defeat of the enemy and calling to base to tell of success 6 men flashing back to wives and singing 10 minute songs that was the basic movie and that same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times and every time it did a flashback to the wives it would show the man then his wife and him there were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback so this took up tons of time other than that the men couldn't kill their enemy except with either bayonets or grenades i liked the music and there was a lot of action though the action was repetitive overall i probably wouldn't see it again but it wasn't too horrible
<START> hah so this is the movie that the next action stars were getting into well i'm glad that i didn't participate and didn't win br br isn't it funny how one can just look at the first 10 seconds and make up ones mind about a movie i mean come on just look at those titles i watched this movie or part of this teleplay since it was produced for tv and we couldn't bear to watch the whole thing one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical hodge podge of average guys that once in a while watch series like las vegas just for the girls in the show so the bar wasn't really high the most watched movie in my group was girl next door and it wasn't because of the great script d but this movie's total lack of originality acting scripting and just about everything else that makes a movie good made it pretty easy to switch channel to las vegas or was it csi don't remember without any complaints by the rest of the group and that is rare for heavens sake don't by this movie if it's on tv then yes watch it and contemplate on it my conclusion well since joel silver has indeed produced some of the best action films out there die hard matrix 1 to name some i can only say that producers don't give the film it's quality they provide money for the directors and to sell this movie just because it's a joel silver movie is just a desperate attempt to conceal the obvious flaws of the crew who really made it
<START> i've never understood the appeal of garbo she always comes across in her films as stuck up not all that alluring and that annoying voice that could have drowned out the tuba section she was also a very limited actress like gloria swanson far better off left in the silent era in this her last film her performance is very average and even unassured she tries hard but it all comes to nothing because the script is even worse than her acting br br a would be screwball romcom that is never once believable and never gets off the ground even though melvyn douglas manages to get airborne in the skiing scenes which are really the only amusing thing here br br there was potential but the script fails in almost every department wasting every actor in it douglas and garbo had good enough chemistry together but this one isn't even a spot on ninotchka which i also found to be extremely overrated
<START> this movie reminds me of irrÃ©versible 2002 another art work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature i did not like the movie but i cannot say that it is a bad movie it is just special i reminds me also of camping cosmos 1996 where a bunch of low class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in belgium the same description of people living together side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match together i also thought about the books by the french writer emile zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism i did not like the movie and i also do not like the people who are in it they all seem so vulgar without any basic good taste one could ask the question why do they live they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce forced to live against their will or you could say the hell is on this world
<START> okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a 60 000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldn't you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her and at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her proof i don't know i was not happy with the ending this movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy
<START> the person who wrote the review enough with the sweating and spitting already has no grasp of what cultural literary or psycho critique is he dismisses zizek's interpretations because they don't seem in line with what the director originally intended so what the importance of a director's or author's intention is not important in critical theory this is known as the author's intentional fallacy and should be avoided br br http en wikipedia org wiki intentional fallacy a text or movie can be analyzed through a number of theories many of which disagree with one another as well as completely ignore the author's intention this is the most fundamental idea of critical theory br br because of this whoever wrote that wall of text wasted a lot of time and effort on insulting zizek in reality anyone who studies theory would immediately discredit this guys opinion i suggest you should too as it is completely off point br br that being said if you are at all interested in freudian laconian or kristevian discourse this movie is a must it connects these theories with popular film making them much more palpable and enjoyable than simply reading or thinking about them
<START> this su k why do they have to make movies that they must know su k from the beginning i mean look at alien from 1977 if the movie youÂ´r about to make is not better than anything made billions of years before why make it i had problems with the plot and who the main character was that's not good either
<START> honestly i was disappointed in expiration date super clever title and interesting premise but i don't think it delivered what was it about the main character's desire to reconnect with his native roots or more likely it was his need to overcome his fear of death but he wasn't set up as someone who has lived his life in fear it seems as if his life was going fine but since doomsday is approaching he should now start worrying i didn't buy it meanwhile the supporting characters in the film didn't seem to have needs that blended into an overarching story they were all just doing their thing running parallel to the main character also what was treated as a curse looked more like a coincidence who cursed the family why when finally why didn't he just plan on staying in his apartment all day on his birthday those are my criticisms but i did love the shots of seattle cinematography was beautiful acting was good in the times it wasn't outstanding
<START> probably the best film of the year for me this small french film centers on put upon office secretary carla emmanuelle devos who spends her days doing other men's jobs uncredited and being the source of their scorn and lunchtime conversation which is all too clear to her as being partially deaf she reads lips a change is set in motion when she hires newly paroled con paul vincent cassel as her assistant the relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film mutual dependency for vastly different reasons bonds them carla becomes attracted to paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive for what seems like the first time paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help he owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him which will involve carlas' skill of reading lips i think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspense drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars throughout the whole film no matter what other characters are on screen you can feel this amazing bond between carla and paul i cannot remember when i have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors emmanuell devos gives a brilliant performance she won the french cesar for best actress you never feel like you are watching a piece of acting this really is carla the chameleon like vincent cassel is also wonderful he makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive i loved this film because of these two people and both times when i had finished watching it i wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again
<START> this highly derivative film will be entertaining for the many who have not seen some of the more obscure anime films i enjoyed most of it especially after the rather flat opening minutes in the museum although the pre title sequence is very entertaining and includes some of the better bits of animation james garner as the commander and leonard nimoy as the king give impressive performances
<START> i have been an admirer of edward burtynsky's work for years and it was such a pleasure to be able to see the man at work thanks to jennifer baichwal's documentary the severe beauty of the ship breaking yard in bangladesh the stone quarry in vermont the enormous assembly plant in china the beleaguered old neighbourhoods in shanghai that are just waiting to be torn down these landscapes are captured so well by the photographer and the filmmaker br br at times i thought of old tv documentaries on abandoned coal mines and plastic mold factories the sort of stuff i grew up watching burtynsky's work has the great value of pointing out how the industrial activity has only shifted to asia it has not stopped the strangest scene for me was the computer scrap yard somewhere in china the waste had a threatening air about it while the workers were very jovial
<START> i was going to bed with my gf last night and while she was brushing her teeth i flipped channels until i came across this chinese movie called the king of masks at first i thought it was going to be a kung fu movie so i started watching it and then it immediately captured me in and i had to finish it br br the little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble she was such a great actor for being so little maybe the fact it was in chinese so the english was dubbed made it harder for me to tell but she really seemed to be in character perfectly i felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her boss but everything just turned out rotten lol even when she brings him another grandson just so he can pass on his art it turns out that kid was kidnapped so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live lol whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa just backfires br br in the end he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie br br definitely a gem and totally original br br scott
<START> what's good about it some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan doesn't rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its gotcha moments even if you've seen everything there's still a few things in this film that will make your jaw drop br br what could have been better about it the acting was at times flat and unconvincing it had a shot on video quality in some places though it mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for and the camera work is full of needless close ups of meaningless actions though the effects are genuinely creepy i think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them the ending seemed rushed and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments the viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves not as a challenge by the filmmakers but because they just missed it br br still a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average well worth the rental
<START> this is a very funny movie i have no idea whether it translates well into other languages or not however i do think men all over the world can identify with frank and his thoughts to some extent these thoughts are hugely entertaining and women will also enjoy this movie i'm sure br br all cast members perform well and this film could have been a tremendous hit all over the world if it was made in england or the us but for those of you who are fortunate enough to understand swedish you are in for a treat br br highly recommended
<START> i bought this movie from gamestop's discount used movie bin and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably so i bought it for 99cents the movie itself is retarded and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the whole film that hardly look alike not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey br br the director more than likely committed a murder suicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent warner bros film and he ended up owing money to the studio it also doesn't help that he wasn't even infamous for the terrible job he did he wasn't even known for producing a poop chute film br br why was this movie ever made
<START> it has been some years since i saw this but remember it and would like to see it again it kind of became a therapy for me with a personal experience of my own br br a thirty five year old man laments over a high school baseball game in which he missed the ball and his team lost he thinks about it 20 years later if only i'd hit that ball and how his life would be better because of it then he gets a chance to find out and gets a little more than he bargained for br br it reminds me so much of when i was in high school i twice tried out for our drill dance team and didn't make it this team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school if you were on it you were all that i didn't try out till my last two years of hs and after the second time i took it really hard i'd hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts and wore tights to cover the bruise and that caused me to not make it that was in 1987 br br through the years even now sometimes i think if only i hadn't hit my leg i would've never worn those stupid tights now i don't sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had i made it but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past who knows it could have changed the course of events to the point that i wouldn't have met my son's father br br i would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change be careful what you wish for
<START> i caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my college's gaming club we were forewarned that this would be the reefer madness of gaming and this movie more than delivered br br tom hanks plays robbie a young man re starting his college career after resting for a semester what we the viewer find out as the movie progresses is that robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role playing game called mazes and monsters a game that he gets re acquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaign br br this movie is laughable on many many levels one scene features the group gaming by candlelight which is probably the best way i can describe it while i'm sure that this was meant to be cultish in some way as most gamers know it's horribly inaccurate most role play sessions are done in well lit rooms usually over some chee tohs and a can of soda br br the acting while not oscar caliber isn't gut wrenchingly awful either this is one of tom hanks's first roles and bosom buddies and bachelor party were still a year or two over the horizon the supporting cast while not very memorable still hand forth decent performances br br mainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a made for tv movie that shows the dangers of gaming worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night
<START> sundown featuring the weakest dorkiest vampires ever seen accompanied by one of the most unfitting pretentious scores ever written and with shane the vampire who's every move and spoken word was so ridiculous that i burst out laughing half the times and rolled my eyes the rest br br the vampires don't seem to have any special powers at all except for strength sometimes being able to switch off a lamp with their mind one time and that's it really ever imagine count dracula worriedly recoiling from a fight 'cause he ran out of bullets neither did i practically any other movie dracula would eat this one for breakfast skin his followers and use their bones as toothpicks br br the main plot of the movie is that a human family of four gets caught up in a vampire gang fight dracula's vs some old geezer's it could have been some good old b flick fun but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a bit too seriously and ends up ruining the remaining part of the movie not already ruined by clay bats mediocre acting and the laughable screenplay br br in the end it's just too silly to be funny sure it has some amusing moments but they're few and far apart
<START> it's frequently said that movies can never equal the original book well in this case not only the movie is not as good as the book but is an insult to the book i'd rather see milan kundera's novel turned on fire than into this something which the director probably calls adaptation br br all the beautiful philosophy that asks is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders or cope with the unbearable lightness of being is put aside and instead all the movie deals with is daniel day lewis' i cannot say tomas sexual adventures with his dumb wife his mistress and his other mistresses franÃ§ois truffaut already said it bad directors make bad movies don't waste your time and money read the book instead it's really worth it
