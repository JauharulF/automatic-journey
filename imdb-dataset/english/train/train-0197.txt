<START> i have seen this movie plenty of times and i gotta tell ya i've enjoyed it every single time this is belushi's pinnacle movie in my opinion belushi and lovitz are so likable and identifiable with the common man that you can't help but get involved once you start watching the movie has a wonderful cast of stars some already were big and others were just getting started it's billed as a feel good movie and that's exactly what it is this movie teaches you that life isn't always so bad after all sometimes you've just gotta look at stuff in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have when you're done watching you'll appreciate the things you have a lot more and you'll also be smiling you can't ask for much more from a movie in my opinion not to mention it's a hilarious movie and you'll never lose interest very very underrated movie here folks br br rating from me 10 i am out
<START> i don't know why but for some sick reason i think since i've been on the disney sequel binge i decided to just go ahead and see 102 dalmations the first movie that was a remake of the disney cartoon classic starring glenn close as cruella de vil it seemed like a sure hit but it was just a bomb i think the reason why these movies don't work is because 101 dalmations the original was a cartoon it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults this was not really that fun because it's adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings i understand they're trying to make sure that it's appealing to the kids but it's ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film and 102 dalmations's story isn't really that good br br cruella de vil has been in prison for a while but things change when she is proved that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being but her reputation is now damaged as a puppy napper but she buys a man's dog shelter and is all of a sudden is being loved by everyone and it looks like she's changed but when she sees her probation officer's dalmatians she goes crazy and starts seeing spots and she looses it she's back for revenge on puppies and is still determined to get that dalmation coat she's always wanted br br glenn close is such an amazing actress very under rated but her taking on cruella de vil she's good but let's face it this movie made the fun villain just more of a silly nut case also as cute as the puppies were it just works more for the animation it sounds stupid but it's just not as believable without the cartoon and their personalities being in the mix i wouldn't really recommend 102 dalmations it's alright but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time this is just the same thing br br 2 10
<START> i watched scarecrows because of the buzz surrounding it well i can't imagine anyone liking this movie because it's just bad bad bad br br it's obvious that whoever made this movie doesn't know a single thing about horror the whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres action movie guns and criminals and horror living scarecrows when the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows the two genres automatically cancel each other out because first they're criminals and who cares about criminals and second because they're stupid criminals to boot having zombie scarecrows go after them just doesn't work here where's the horror in that i wanted the criminals to die horrible painful deaths br br but the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres which could have been original if handle well never gels we're simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows which are alive for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible tv like and worse offense of all whole bunches of the dialogue are told on cbs and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected images as if we're watching some sort of radio show this part was really bad the director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea i can't tell you how annoying that was br br as i've already mentioned the criminals in scarecrows are amazingly stupid for instance when someone suddenly shows up gutted and filled with money and straw yep straw in his huge open wound the others ask what drug is he on after they shoot tons of bullets in him unable to kill him he's been zombiefied by the scarecrows don't ask get a freaking clue morons i've never seen such stupid people in a movie and then there's the girl i wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a pain in the butt when she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow cross she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene bad acting even though the criminals couldn't have done it what a dimwit she was but the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick they're not scary nothing much is explained about them they're just a plot device in this plot device filled movie br br mr wesley filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds nonstop doesn't elicit anything but sheer boredom and that scene with the talking head in the fridge thanks for the laughter br br all in all this had to be one of the worst movies i've seen recently and i've seen a lot of movies these days between the equally woeful silo killer or scarecrows i'd rather watcher silo killer again yep scarecrows is that bad
<START> if you have read the books then forget the characters that tolkien built in your head the representation of hobbits dwarves etc have had the 'disney' treatment the dark riders are excellent and as i had always imagined from the books br br cinematically this is an excellent film mixing live motion and animation to produce amazing effects for the year i only wish he bakshi had been given the money to complete his epic br br it's worth having the video as they will be worth a bit after the 2001 lord of the rings
<START> just a note to add to the above comment fear of a black hat doesn't have the criminal who's image has been ripped off by the band that's in cb4 easily confused as the two films are so similar but black hat is vastly the superior of the two yeah
<START> the 40 year old virgin exists in a world i don't understand a world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to f off and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded a world where it's really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other peoples' cars a world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings a world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities and a world without any funny jokes i am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie i thought every scene was like a bad saturday night live sketch not very funny to begin with and stretched out beyond all rational thought the chest waxing scene went on forever br br the characters aside from carell were totally one note and the romantic elements were completely contrived particularly the scene where keener finds porn in carell's apartment that was just lame br br and i also found the aquarius sequence totally annoying and excessive i hated hated hated this movie
<START> my first exposure to the templarios not a good one i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video which has brought us other cult classics such as spider baby the print quality is excellent but this alone can't hide the fact that the film is deadly dull there's a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous ultimately unfulfilling adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket
<START> caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channels and was so intrigued i sought out the next showing br br i really didn't know what to expect after reading the program summary but i came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed it also gave me as adult who attended high school in the 80's a little better insight into what our kids have to contend with these days br br the fact that you don't see the shooting only adds to the chillness of the plot to see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend and come to terms with the senseless shootings was at times overwhelming and will admit that i shed quite a few tears throughout br br on the whole not a movie that i would seek out to what however i am sure glad i did see it
<START> this is one of the first and best columbos starring robert culp and ray milland robert culp appeared on another columbo as did several other villains including patrick mcgoohan william shatner and jack cassidy ray milland also made a later appearance br br in this one ray milland is convinced his beautiful wife played by patricia crowley is having an affair so he hires culp to investigate culp has a blackmailing business on the side so he gives milland a fake report and threatens crowley with the real one if she doesn't pay up they get into a huge fight in culp's home and she winds up murdered enter columbo br br culp does everything he can to get columbo off the case including offering him a job but columbo is on to him from the beginning br br excellent episode
<START> if you have any sort of appreciation for character and dialogue and any sense of american cultural history you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film it probably was originally a play and that's why it's dialogue heavy but i can't stress enough how these icons that we only have a shallow understand of are made into truly complex and wonderful characters br br this film is better than any college course for telling you how to create a character driven story br br
<START> i just got the uk 4 disc special edition of superman 1 for about 5 the additional stuff includes the 1951 feature superman and the mole men so i slapped it into the dvd player last night and here are my findings br br some initial disappointment i hadn't checked and i think i had it mentally tagged as one of the kirk alyn serials i'm not a huge fan of george reeves as superman and i hadn't seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk alyn but hey ho never mind br br this black and white production runs for less than an hour it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of reeves' early tv series a two parter put together for cinema release although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series in any event it's an odd choice for reasons i'll get to later i'm of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets so there were no major surprises here even so for a low budget movie this one is really low budget br br the story concerns the small town of silsby population 1 430 which puzzlingly is also home to the world's deepest oil well 6 miles the story opens with the well's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis reporters kent and lane to report on the well at the behest of the oil company as clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down a couple of odd little guys small in stature big in head black in jumpsuit and bushy in eyebrow emerge from the capped off drillshaft and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces br br a deep breath now here is the remaining plot of the picture the little guys scare some kids so jeff corey playing the town's rampant xenophobe incites some pals to kill these creatures superman steps in moderately ineffectually and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital corey's pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed but he escapes and legs it down the shaft corey incites a lynch mob despite the sheriff arresting him to hang the hospitalised mole man superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows a total of 4 mole men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey i call this an aargh gun because its sole effect seems to be to make corey go aargh and superman saves him he immediately changes his ways because of amazement at superman saving him after the way he has behaved the mole men go back down the shaft the end br br despite the film only being an hour long there is an inordinate amount of creeping around bewareing and pursuing i have left out all the mole man 1 creeps from a to b looking out to make sure no one is following him stuff the mole men are never engaged in any way whatsoever they have no dialogue they just turn up get persecuted and go back they do look a little creepy but they are hardly the bug eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies br br reeves is quite a good clark kent very much a hard nosed reporter much more so than phyllis coates' rather indifferent lois lane but he is a terrible terrible superman not only does he not look the part at least his hair is dyed black in this which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the tv episodes the way he plays it is all wrong in my book i'm sure he was told to strike the pose which superman does constantly but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips not fists on ribs and he plays superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher he doesn't actually wag his finger in remonstration but he may as well have done br br and superman does a huge amount of walking around i say a huge amount he isn't actually in it all that much and a bit of running he takes off and lands a couple of times but isn't seen in flight at any point oh some bullets bounce off him and he uses telescopic vision as clark but with no accompanying visual effect in fact visual effects are conspicuous by their absence and the few which are present aren't very good br br i've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time but even by those standards i think it's a pretty threadbare effort thankfully production standards on the tv series were higher and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them br br something of a disappointment i shan't be watching it again
<START> one of john's funniest eugene levy is great in this one as well just wish the studio would figure out that this one needs to be on dvd i have it on video tape but feel that this film deserves dvd and extras would be great the kung fu uuniversity kung fu u skit is so very funny as is the entire film also the scenes he has with his girlfriend and her family are great this movie never seems to be on tv but it loses most of it's hilarity when edited for broadcast tv if you can find the video i would suggest you buy it ebay is a good place to find a copy i will keep my vhs until one day we get to see it on dvd there are so many great movies out there that still have not been released to dvd and this is one of them
<START> honestly i don't know what's funnier this horrific remake or the comments on this board masterpiece's review had me in tears that's so funny anyway this movie is the among the worst movies ever and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels the omen name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on hbo but it's a slap in the face to the other three especially the original there are so many classically bad moments but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair good times this movie is to the omen series what scary movie is to the entire genre avoid unless you're looking for a good laugh
<START> although it was released way back in 1967 in cold blood still remains the benchmark by which all true crime films are matched veteran writer director richard brooks elmer gantry adapted truman capote's non fiction book into a chilling docudrama that retains a disturbing power even today thirty five years later br br robert blake and scott wilson portray perry smith and dick hickock two ex cons who on a tip from hicock's old cellmate floyd wells broke into the holcomb kansas home of herbert clutter looking for a wall safe supposedly containing 10 000 but no safe was ever found and the two men instead wound up killing mr clutter his wife and their two children getting away with only a radio a pair of binoculars and a lousy forty dollars two months on the run including an aimless vacation in northern mexico ended in las vegas when cops caught them in a stolen car but it eventually comes out after merciless grilling by kansas law enforcement officials that these two men committed that heinous crime in holcomb tried and convicted on four counts of murder they stew in jail over a five year period of appeals and denials until both are hanged to death on april 14 1965 br br blake and smith are absolutely chilling as the two dispassionate killers who show no remorse for what they've done but are concerned about getting caught john forsythe also does a good turn as alvin dewey the chief detective investigating the crime as does gerald s o'laughlin as his assistant in a tactic that is both faithful to capote's book and a good artistic gambit all around brooks does not show the murders at the beginning instead he shows the two killers pulling up to the clutter house as the last light goes out then cuts to the next morning and the horrifying discovery of the bodies only during the ride back to kansas when blake is questioned by forsythe and narrates the story do we see the true horror of what happened that night we don't see that much blood being spilled in these scenes but we don't need to the shotgun blasts and the horrified look on the clutters' faces as they know they are about to die are more than disturbing enough so there is no need to resort to explicitly bloody slasher film violence br br brooks wisely filmed in cold blood in stark black and white and the results are excellent thanks to conrad hall's expertise the chilling jazz score by quincy jones is the capper the end result is one of the most unsettling films of any kind ever made devastating in its own low key fashion it is a 134 minute study of a crime that shook an entire state and indeed an entire nation and should be seen though viewer discretion is advised the 'r' rating is there for a reason
<START> when one thinks of 1950s science fiction films one thinks of the sort of schlocky black and white b films that were parodied on the old mystery science theater 3000 television show yet while there were far more films like plan 9 from outer space and robot monster than good films the 1950s did have some very good if not great science fiction films like the day the earth stood still the incredible shrinking man invasion of the body snatchers war of the worlds and the thing from another world yet the best of the bunch for its literacy and production values was undoubtedly mgm's first big foray into a level science fiction forbidden planet released in 1956 it was a 98 minute color film directed by fred m wilcox that featured then state of the art special effects and was endowed with a very good screenplay by cyril hume from a screen treatment called fatal planet by irving block and allen adler who adapted aspects of william shakespeare's the tempest into it br br the film drew raves when it was released for its oscar nominated special effects its all electronic music score by louis and bebe barron although credited as electronic tonalities to avoid music guild fees vivid matte paintings inspired by chesley bonestell and the famed monster of the id moti which was animated by an animator joshua meador on loan from the walt disney studio even more famous was the appearance of robby the robot in his first role in either film or television later he would appear in the film the invisible boy included in this dvd as a bonus as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi tv shows the twilight zone night gallery and lost in space with whose own robot he is often confused and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film gremlins br br the tale is simple but elegantly constructed and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced 'love story' aspect in the film in the 23rd century the united planets cruiser c 57d a flying saucer led by commander j j adams leslie nielsen yes he was once a leading man type before his police squad days is en route to the planet altair iv to investigate what happened to the crew of the bellerophon sent to the planet twenty years earlier after a year's journey there they encounter the lone survivor of the party doctor edward morbius walter pidgeon the prospero stand in a philologist his gorgeous blond daughter altaira anne francis the miranda character in a pre 1960s miniskirt and robby the robot the domestic servant who is the calibanian counterpart morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the bellerophon party in their first year yet he was immune to itÂ all in all it's a technically good film especially with some rear projections and matte paintings and the absurdity of the adult reactions to timmy's and robby's exploits borders an dalian surreal absurdity yet it's manifest that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film conjures for it's played straight thus making it even funnier as for the main feature forbidden planet deserves all its kudos it's not a perfect film but it's a great way to spend a couple of hours and far better than star wars which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated and juvenile only such films like 2001 a space odyssey solaris alien and aliens and the first two terminator films have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects br br it's worth knowing that despite forbidden planet's 'happy ending' there is the possibility that the moti is still dormant within alta as well after all she is her father's daughter and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the moti attacked the ship a second time also the film wisely only 'shows' the moti once and never shows the krel for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects the film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale something that far more realistic art films often fail to do forbidden planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious cold war allegories watch it and you will agree as well as sleep a little less easy but even if you don't there's still the scene of anne francis skinnydipping that alone is timeless
<START> this was a fairly creepy movie i found the music to be effective for this the photographs mario took of the village were also unnerving however i had three problems with this film one is that the lighting was very dark so some of the time it was hard to tell what was going on but this may have just been my copy the second is that the very beginning is not explained very well and i'm still not sure what was going on there the third problem is that i didn't understand the ending but apparently some people do of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things and the male lead is very 70s all in all watchable but not even close to being a favorite
<START> we showed this movie at the local film society and the art house crowd had the time of their cinematic lives it's tasteless groovy and very funny in a sixties kind of way the kraft kitchen recipe sketch had them laughing like maniacs the rest is a mixed bag but the highs definitely beat the lows by the way whatever happened to ken shapiro
<START> let me start off by saying that this doesn't seem or feel like a movie it seems like just another tv show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it up br br the camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the public connect with it this film takes us to where no movie i've seen has done before to a realm where the film theater becomes a warm medium giving the public every element of interpretation too obvious the large movie screen is only used as an enlarged tv from where we can see every attribute of these women in a larger than life manner br br lately it seems that young directors are compromising the art of film making for sales this is very scary the industry is spoiling the art in movies we must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language are really about not just sales and entertainment but a way to communicate feelings passions and even culture not as a launching platform for young divas and jocks
<START> stairway to heaven is a outstanding invention of movie making probably never duplicated i rank it with the wizard of oz and african queen although it is a totally different type of movie than african queen stairway to heaven is a psycho drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that to my knowledge are totally unique br br for example there is the combination of b w and color footage as in oz but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple but beautiful effect achieved in oz in stairway the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful br br another brilliant aspect of stairway is the concept of time and how it is used here how could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still Â literally and then there is the stairway itself br br if you have any imagination at all you will agree with me stairway to heaven is a true gem
