<START> a bad rip off attempt on seven complete with sub second grade acting awful camera work half baked story and strong aftertaste of lame propaganda yeah them sex offenders they live next door and you're gonna get raped really br br no surprises from the vice terminatrix woman she acts as always as convincingly as a piece of wood richard gere keeps on sliding lower and lower and is about as low here as a late steven seagal br br the singer woman with the crazy eyes is best when she's dead in bed and even the wolf was sub par although she was the best performer in the movie maybe they fed her before the shots or something br br unlike seven which had a made up but interesting story to which one could relate more or less regardless of the country this movie seems to focus on a us only obsession if one doesn't care much about sex offenders and the statistics are that lack of exercise and bad diet cause more pain suffering and death there is little reason to see it or to be afraid br br there are some body part fetishes and some snuff but the gore is less then mediocre and fails both as artistic device because it is pointless and as gore because it is not gory enough br br don't waste time on this one
<START> i really really wanted to like julian po i think that slater is underrated as an actor and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film i realize this is based on a short story which i have not read so i do not know if what i see as the film's faults originated with the story or were imposed on it by the director screenwriter the premise is wonderful and i loved the voiceover confessional tone the opening narration strikes but then nothing several of the cliched local characters ask julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide one could argue that he doesn't answer because it's none of their business but julian is the one who under only token pressure blurted out his intentions in public then neither julian nor the director writer despite the fact that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for god's sake seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on julian's life he says he was a bookkeeper he says his family moved around when he was a child due to his father's job so what there are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate julian's purpose but none of them go anywhere because julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet as if he were the ultimate and only sane one among them this might work as an allegory if julian po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive religious wife of the mechanic and what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for julian i can only see the julian character as rendered as selfish petty and totally condescending sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half baked contrived film and poor michael parks an actor who once had so much promise is given nothing to work with here
<START> this anime seriously rocked my socks when the anime first opened itself i felt it was too slow the story wasn't quite moving forward and shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead once he learns more about tracing and you learn more about saber and the holy grail war itself the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together it was fantastic br br additionally i felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop in the real world there wasn't any stupid completely obvious things going on the development of ilya and rin was interesting to watch but i think the way shirou and saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on a few of the surprise people that show up gilgamesh seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another meaning we didn't have generic bad ass a being replaced by generic bad ass b as soon as a died br br anddd i loved the music the opening music rocked and the finishing theme from the final episode just seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more good job type moon
<START> like a relative that gives you a bad gift soul survivors has its heart in the right place but trips up with a bad execution stephen carpenter's writing directing effort borrows freely from other better films such as jacob's ladder and abre los ojos open your eyes for those who haven't seen either of these films i won't give the premise away suffice to say it's not nearly as well handled here than in those two superior films br br melissa sagemiller stars as cassie about to go away to college her current boyfriend sean ben affleck and ex boyfriend matt wes bentley both friends and annabel acerbic eliza dushku are in a car accident after being pursued by two killers in transparent masks she survives the wreck but while attending college has visions of the hospital ordeal and dead people reappear and disappear leaving her in a state of total confusion who is dead who's alive what's real br br soul survivors has the look of a bad been there done that gore filled blood splattered body stacking teen exploitation flick true it has its share of killer stalking the victim scenes plentiful repetitive and mind numbing but at least it attempts to build suspense through ideas rather than cliches unfortunately rather unsuccessfully it breeds confusion much more often than cohesion as the story becomes jumbled messy and incoherent near key points of the mystery predictable as it is br br horror fans who pick up a copy will have no idea they are in for a film that is more concerned with building an uneasy facade of reality than delivering a body count credit goes to carpenter for attempting to create something beyond a derivative teen horror flick too bad he's created a derivative psychological thriller sagemiller also deserves kudos for showing strength in the central performance actually developing her character and evoking some sense of emotion as the unraveling cassie it's great the filmmakers try something different but the film ends up a mixed bag and failed experiment br br 4 out of 10
<START> cage 1989 was another one of those low budget buddy action flicks that were produced during the 80's thanks in large part due to the films such as 48hrs and lethal weapon this one stars reb brown and lou ferrigno as to former vietnam vets who happen to run a local dive bar reb takes care of lou because he saved his life in 'nam but lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft although he's huge lou has the brain of a child one day some ruffians throw their wait around in the bar and lou and rebb beat the tar out of them but payback's a mother they crash the bar leaving lou and reb with nothing that is until these two thugs come into the picture one of them's a real nice guy who have a plan in mind br br the film's a waste of time maybe if they went all they way and made a hard core action flick instead of trying to tone down the gruesomeness of the situation perhaps it could have worked alas it doesn't and the audience is left holding the bag oh well it's too bad because you have all the elements for a great b movie better luck next time i guess br br not recommended br br xxx
<START> there is a dvd published in the uk in 2002 code hrgd002 on the cover no asin vfc 19796 on the disk no ifpi code in the inner rim br br probably a straight transfer from vhs br br there is no much point is commenting an adult film but this one contains a minimal plot and the characters are believable it was shown in the united states in normal cinemas br br i've seen it in pensylvannia way back in 1975 br br as such it deserves a place in an encyclopedia of movies the dvd has no special features and no subtitles and was probably made using a vhs tape as source
<START> is this a stupid movie you bet i could not find any moment in this film that was creepy or scary stupid moments plenty stupid characters you bet bad effects everywhere rick baker may have gone and done bigger and better things this is not one of them oh well people gotta start somewhere dr ted nelson is cheesed he is the most whiny doctor i've ever seen he's got a melting man running amok out in ventura county somewhere he's not overly happy that his wife is pregnant probably cause she's 55 years old and weighs 90 lbs and there's no crackers to be found anywhere plus he's got the not too helpful general on his hinder wanting to find astronaut steve and the local sheriff wants to know what's going on even though mr nelson can't tell him anything there also some random characters thrown in for good measure who encounter the melting man eventually the movie ends and out monster gets scooped into a trash can to become compost in the end it's just what you need for a great mst episode
<START> in my opinion this is one of the greatest movies ever made in america and it deserved every single award it won and it's place on the afi top 100 list though it's shamefully too low on the imdb top 250 list at only 183 as of this writing if you enjoy acting of the highest calibre voight and hoffman are a superb match well drawn characterizations and inventive direction editing and cinematography you'll love this just as much as i did schlesinger paints a vivid always credible picture of the late 60s new york city scene and it's many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the amorality poverty and hopelessness of 42nd street new york city br br the filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground new york film movement and of the city and are nothing less than dazzling i've seen many ideas including the rapid fire editing the handling of the voice over flashbacks the drug trip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror stolen by other filmmakers br br the relationship between joe and ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship or having it's homosexual underpinnings i think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life whether it be sexual or not br br midnight cowboy is a brave moving film of magnitude influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of it's impact over the years so if you haven't seen it you're really missing out on a true american classic i recommend this film to everyone br br score 10 out of 10
<START> i rented new best friend hoping for a movie similar to enjoyable teen thrillers such as gossip and the curve instead new best friend is much more like the in crowd in which there are no thrills and the acting is incredibly phony new best friend is boring and the events during the movie are the same skip this movie it's a waste of time
<START> heart pounding erotic drama are the words that come to mind when i think of secret games it becomes more erotic as the film goes along and at one point blew me away i didn't expect the delightful scene i was about to encounter the call girl has her first customer and what a customer one of the most erotic lesbian scenes i have ever seen the husband should have listened to his wife and perhaps she wouldn't have gone on this erotic journey it turned out to cost them in the end but it was one exciting ride go see this movie
<START> renny harlin's first american film was one of the best of a slew of prison set horror films like death house or the chair in the late 80's twenty years before guard lane smith had wrongfully executed a condemned man now he is the warden of the newly re opened prison and the man's ghost is back for bloody revenge this atmospheric and very moody film features lots of gruesome gore and violence viggo mortensen tiny lister tom everett and kane hodder are onhand for the entertaining carnage

<START> of all arnold's mid '80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be the running man a chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality tv gone mad it may have been far fetched back then but not so now not when you think about it currently reality tv shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar if the next one isn't more controversial as the last it's a dud how long will it be before we really do see shows like the running man how long before we have 'court appointed theatrical attorneys' or the entertainment division of the justice department there is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of tv shows br br the biggest message of all is 'you are being lied to' it's no secret that the government and the media work in cahoots and the masses believe what the media tells them to believe it's a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the running man in the near future it's no secret that reality tv is not very realistic it's edited and reshaped before being aired and it's only what the networks want you to see usually it's far from the real truth br br although rather different than stephen king's book the ending is completely changed the script does conform to the typical arnie formula yes he does have numerous and very corny one liners and he does say 'i'll be back' which he never really said that often anyway when you think about it in the most ironic situation yet but he's still a zillion times better in the role then christopher reeve or dolph lundgren would have been these two were considered before arnie believe it or not br br the director is none other than dave starsky himself paul michael glaser it may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look andrew davis not a director i particularly like was attached before glaser though no matter who directs the film is still marred by a very heavy 80's feel br br first of all harold faltermeyer's score remember him is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity and the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future apart from the dated feel the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot out that passes as the climax br br this new dvd is a zillion times better than the original release gone is the horrid letterbox picture in its place is a brand new hi definition 1 85 1 anamorphic transfer the colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen the new dolby 5 1 ex and dts es soundtrack are also amazing there constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful definitely one of the best re masters i've seen so far two intriguing documentaries a trailer and a 'meet the stalkers' gimmick are included in this 2 disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case
<START> jackie chan's classic directorial feature police story 1985 is among the most influential and over the top modern day police actioners ever to come out from hong kong jackie wanted simply to make a movie which would include the usual kung fu and also fierce gun play and other urban action which would later become very popular and typical among hk directors like john woo and ringo lam police story mixes these two action elements and styles and the result is as wild as it sounds br br jackie plays chan ka kui a police who gets to protect an important witness brigitte lin who would soon testify against a powerful gangster boss and his ring of criminal activity jackie's girlfriend is played by young and sweet maggie cheung who isn't as wild here as she would be in her subsequent roles like heroic trio and the sequel by johnnie to savior of the soul by corey yuen and david lai and many many others the plot in police story is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place br br jackie did of course all the stunts of his character by himself and also hurt himself pretty badly in couple of scenes some of which are also in the completed movie like at the end in which jackie hits his head near the eye through a very nasty looking sharp piece of glass also jackie's stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film the scene in which a bus stops right before jackie spitting the kidnappers through the windshield went really bad as the bus stopped too early and the stuntmen didn't fly as they were supposed to they were supposed to fly on the car parked in the front of the bus but their flight was too short and they hit through the asphalt with hospital level injuries during the end credits there is a behind the scenes imagery and images of these injured actors and it all looks really bad and almost tasteless but fortunately no one got killed or injured too severely br br the action is more than plentiful and imaginative as can be expected by action director chan the now legendary bus scene and shopping mall scene at then end are most likely among the wildest scenes any action film has been able to deliver jackie always tells how important editing is which is true and it really shows in his action scenes and their timing which is perfect and makes the films look so ultra kinetic when compared to hollywood efforts for instance there's hardly any slow moments here and also those moments are interesting and the film never becomes boring or hard to watch br br but there is again one negative point which i cannot stand in hk action comedies which is this comedy itself the comedy isn't funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay aren't there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue i mean those scenes like the stabbing murder attempt at the beginning when the murderer just shouts and screams and makes faces and acts like a drunken clown from some slapstick nightmare and he is there to murder that girl this kind of acting is stupid and inept and i wouldn't like to see it in a film which is otherwise very great in its own genre characters also speak their thoughts which is also a sign of bad script because those loud thoughts are there just to make things clear even for the stupidest viewer and thus making things way too simple and light even if the film is comic and not so serious these kind of stupidities should not be there and they cannot be forgiven too easily br br police story is a fast speed full impact balls to the walls action adventure miracle from hong kong and from the time when jackie was very sad because of the bad result he got with the us produced the protector as he didn't have the same thoughts about the film as director james glickenhaus had and thus the result didn't please audiences and jackie and he returned to hong kong to make more personal and inventive film that he definitely did and the result is as wild today as it was back then in the 80's this is among the most insane action films ever and it would be somewhat perfect without the flaws i mentioned 7 10
<START> i know it's crude and i know that it isn't at all pc but it's so funny if you can put it into perspective that it's from the early 80's and it carries all the stereotypes of the time and the movie still makes you almost pass out with laughter than it is truly a good comedy going with the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years the subject matter of this film is exagerated if you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half just to have an all out laugh than please watch this br br p s would someone please put this out on dvd it's so hard to find on vhs anymore
<START> there are many good things about the new bsg there's the multiple cylon roles for model 8 and 6 for example which the two actresses played superbly there's the old school feel of industrial design aboard galactica my ship will not be networked over my dead body also all the space battles the special effects even though the seasoned sci fi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all the darkness of the characters their essentially flawed nature br br that makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childish br br yes the first part the scenes in space the raid on the cylons and all that was very good but the mushy ending i always watch films and shows these days with the timer hidden so i never know how much time is left until the end so for me it was a special kind of torture to see the end happen over and over again every time i thought oh this is the final scene the final shot i got one more every frakking character got its complete ending that wasn't really necessary br br what really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all the young roslin scenes why is important for us to know that a she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and b that she has a one night stand with a former pupil student what does that bring to the story where was the linkage now i'm all for a more european ish style approach and a random acts of whateverness in films and shows and all that but this was just ridiculous this didn't bring anything meaningful to the story br br also i've seen the last frakkin special and in it ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot he couldn't come up with a good ending for the story so he just didn't it's never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be the whole this was thousands of years in the past idea the mitochondrial eve thing was also used in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and believe you me there are a lot of bsg watchers who know that particular h2g2 storyline and speaking of hera now there's a storyline that was not worked out well at all instead we get roslin is doing her former pupil who's 20 years younger don't get me wrong i'm all for older women with younger men the more power to them but this just made no sense br br all in all the writing in this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be that goes even moreso for the last episode i hope lost and 24 do better with their series finales
<START> a few years back the same persons who created paris j'taime which was imperfect but very enjoyable my rating was a 7 created this piece of garbage about new york city br br in paris i love you j'taime created a feeling for paris it was made in many parts of beautiful paris br br in this current film i did not recognize new york city i did not feel that i was in the city of my birth br br new york does have 5 boroughs i saw no scenes in the bronx or queens there is one scene in brooklyn brighton beach i saw no scenes in times square or greenwich village no scenes of the beautiful hotels or theatres it does have a large cast most of the performers were not even stereotypes they were caricatures of the lowest sort br br the very few humorous moments are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine new yorkers that we all know love br br a few of the films nominated for the 'razzie' awards were far better br br ratings out of 4 20 points out of 100 imdb 1 out of 10 br br in my way of thinking i think the title should have been br br new york i hate you
<START> spoilers contained br br i'd heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific what i didn't expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go what starts off as a typical cowboy indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic 'comedy' about honus soldier blue of the title played by peter strauss and cresta candice bergen who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the cheyenne the majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit donald pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason they then escape and both turn up separately at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the cheyenne base as cresta used to be married to one of the cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them so far so ordinary then comes the ending after enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they won't they get together storyline the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head similarities can be drawn with the wild bunch at this point of the film but the wild bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn't resort to extreme gratuitous violence in some ways soldier blue reminds me of frank perry's last summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending i didn't hate soldier blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending if you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents i would recommend elem klimov's come and see
<START> tea leoni plays nora wilde a serious photographer who is going through a bad divorce she wants her freedom but it comes at a cost she wants to legitimate photography but is hired to work for the tabloids as a paparazzi her boss is played by the wonderful and divine holland taylor the show was well written most of the time tea's nora was beginning to develop into quite a memorable character but the network just didn't support comedy and they still don't even when they brought in george wendt from cheers they made unnecessary changes in casting and characters the show was fine in the beginning and the audience was getting used to it but then the network botches it up like a bad plastic surgery
<START> sunday would not be sunday without an action movie and when you want intense combat you turn to tom berenger platoon br br here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug lords life's a bitch so he gets a green office type billy zane to help on the mission br br the film is in the hands of luis llosa who stunk up anaconda he doesn't do much better here but berenger makes the movie worthwhile br br sure it may be a little long who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle but is is good tense action when the time is right
