<START> this was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but that's where it ends it seemed like a lackluster set it off meets the west the plot barely made any sense there were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities there were too may unnecessary things going on that didn't pertain to the plot nor did it help further the story along there were also long blank moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations the script should have made more sense as well as the directing i had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie but the casting was great in my opinion if you're only watching for eye candy then this is the movie for you
<START> absolutely the worst film yet by burton who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs a miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film this is the kind of movie where every time something happens you'll be sure to hear someone shout out he's lost his gun or whatever it is to let everybody know carter is really awful and so is wahlberg who can't play this straight and be convincing very nice effects and photography but poor music in the john williams mold by burton's crony elfman heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch phrases from the first movie very poor results br br if anyone else out there also saw sleepy hollow they will probably have noticed as i have the declining quality of burton's films i've heard that this particular project was produced by others and that burton was brought in as director in which case his judgement should be questioned but i think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip the evidence is there in the films in sleepy hollow he couldn't decide what kind of movie he was making whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie and the population of british character actors chris lee etc made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film those are never scary as horror fans know the movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic and no style had been developed to smooth the two together planet of the apes is much the same way and the result comes off more like total recall or tango and cash than like sci fi he's also fallen into the rut of so many other big directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience word to burton if you're out there pick something and do it straight or use some style to peice it all together as in mars attacks or beetlejuice or you might as well retire because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going
<START> the subject is certainly compelling a group of people take their love of gaming one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors kings princes and castles wargaming is an interesting phenomena that delves into our collective need to escape from reality and the sometimes mundaneness of our existence something almost everyone can relate to the characters are the predictable mix of lord of the rings nerds and star trek enthusiasts that's enough to get most people to watch however very quickly the film turns into an insider's view of wargaming with an almost stereotypical thumbing of the nose to viewers who don't get it the filmmakers seem to take the subject of wargaming and this particular one waaaaay too seriously rather than once in awhile recognizing the humor and fun in making a film about adults drssing up in medieval gear and pounding each other with foam swords it's pretty hard for anyone who doesn't sit on their computer for 7 10 hours a day playing games or desiging the latest star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even care however the filmmakers themselves seem not to care choosing to focus solely on the subject of the game itself rather than building a strong narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand moreover the characters themselves are not that compelling and you quickly become bored of them a big no no when you're trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes
<START> there is something in most of us especially guys that admires some really working class small town real men populist fare and sean penn serves it up for us with a cherry on top hey a lot of people use penn as a political whipping boy but i don't rate movies or actor directors based on politics or personality that is what right wing commentators like excretable faux movie reviewer debbie schlussel does while acknowledging he is one of our best actors and a good director i think this picture was a simplistic piece of aimless dreck that he has atoned for since br br okay you have the gist of this there is this good cop a small town trooper joe played against type by david morse who in the opening scene chases some guy on a country farm road in big sixties cars the bad guy stops gets out shoots at him so joe has to blast him dead there was no explanation what drove this man to do such a desperate violent thing and the dead man's parents do some redneck freak out at the police station while joe feels real sad and guilty that he had to kill someone so we know that joe the farmer forced off his land into a cop job is a good basic sort of guy then his brother frank shows up he is a sadistic amoral bully fresh out of the army and nam where the war got his blood lust up some people here and in other reviews called him just an irresponsible hell raising younger brother and sean was trying to make some point about what our john wayne tough guy culture and war does to otherwise good people but what i saw was an amoral sadistic bully who enjoys hurting and ripping people off then there is mom and dad marsha mason and charles bronson who do the requisite turn as old fashioned country couple then die off she by illness and he by shotgun suicide to advance the story for us both times frank the bad guy is away being a miserable sob but good joe brings him back to podunksville from jail so frank can straighten his life out by welding bridges and living with his utterly stupid screaming trashy pregnant wife but joe has a nice wife played by italian actress valeria golina who is mexican and sean uses this as an exercise in some affirmative action embellishment of goody joe and his real soulfulness underneath his uniform and crew cut for me that was an utterly pointless affirmative action subplot that sean uses to burnish his tough guy creds by sucking up to mexicans because mexicans are so tough and cool br br but frank is bad and we get the requisite events like stealing friend's car robbing gas station by beating the clerk over the head then torching the car and all those cool things that hell raisers do then there are the mandatory 8mm film childhood flashbacks of young joey dutifully moving the lawn and cowboy dressed franky jumping on his back and wrestling him and yadda yadda so we all know what deep bond there is between the two of them br br so the film meanders around with a lot of small town schlock to warm the heart of any red stater accompanying the film was a great soundtrack of good sixties songs like jefferson airplane and janis joplin which were totally inappropriate except for the 60's era effect to win the hearts of old hippies the worst offense is that since the movie was inspired by a springsteen song the highway patrolman that song was not included br br so joe's brain dead wife goes into labor and joe runs off to the bar to get loaded and spout some populists drunken victim's spiel about how tough things are while good joey comes to drag him back to his wife the bartender is good ole ceasar played by dennis hopper so viggo frank whigs out for no particular reason and beats his pal ceasar to death after good joe the cop leaves br br so joe has chase his bad brother down and i was so hoping that he would do the right thing and blow that menace to society away instead we get a scene where his brother stops ahead of him in some old 50's junker on some lonely road at night and little franky in his cowboy suit and cap guns gets out of the car to face good joe the kid from the 8mm flashback home movie sequence oy such dreck then to top off this drecky sap fest there is some zen crap about the indian runner who is a messenger becomes the message ala marshall macluhen see what i mean sean has done much better than this so don't be afraid to miss this one
<START> despite or perhaps in part because of the clever use of music to underscore the motivations and ideologies of each of the major characters stereotypes are in and verisimilitude and characterization are out in this not too subtle cinematic screed br br one gets the sense that john singleton was dabbling in post structuralist literary theory because it was the flavor of the day and higher learning was the tendentious result the low point of the movie is the peace rally in which the symbols of the 1960s free love movement are reappropriated for what much more closely resembles a take back the night rally with live stridently identity conscious musical acts in tow perhaps in his prim revisionism the director was trying to assert that identity politics is the new vietnam ooh how adrienne rich of himÂand remy's firing into the crowd is a nice touch if you're into rich's sort of political posturing br br i wish i could give this movie negative stars i can recommend it only to those interested in the 1990s as history a time when radical feminists brought the academic trinity of race class and gender to popular culture and declared man hating a viable and honorable political option where's camille paglia when you need her
<START> maybe it wasn't that good as a whole but the second episode which was the first one i say was so memorable i still remember it today i became a fan of dick francis i would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries br br the cockney slang of the sidekick chico barnes is a lot more amusing to those of us who have never been close to hearing london's bow bells but the leads are attractive and the shows were interesting br br sid halley was one of francis' more interesting characters and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand interestingly electronic hands of the sort used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than the sort invented after world war ii
<START> i saw this movie when i was in israel for the summer my hebrew is not fluent so the subtitles were very useful i didn't feel lost at any point in the movie you tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes br br this movie blew me away it depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the middle east today a homosexual relationship between an israeli and a palestinian it allows a person to enter both realms of the conflict simultaneously the dilemma the emotions entailed the movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one extremist side an absolute must see
<START> it's not often i feel compelled to give negative criticism of a film after all i often feel the maxim if you don't have anything good to say don't say it at all would be apt advice for the many naysayers we listen to everyday who nitpick at things we like if it's all the same to you the reader though i feel compelled to point out that with the lone exception of christopher walken in a returning role as gabriel this movie is pathetically horrid i say this to you to warn you in advance that even if you are a fan of walken's deadpan delivery and style or liked the original prophecy that you will be sorely dissapointed if you buy it return it if you rent it make sure it's only ninety nine cents br br what's wrong with this movie a full list would take too long to read and would bore you to tears but a short summary would be the following the once rather crystalline clear picture of the relationship between angels and mortals of the first film is ripped to shreds gabriel is turned from the rather morbid right hand of god he once was and in this role he is wickedly funny in the first to little more than a thug for heaven since walken is so good at playing heavies we all remember frank white from king of new york he is still enjoyable but the supporting cast is an unmitigated and unconvincing mess of mortals and angels alike who couldn't buy a clue for 50 cents if you can figure out the plot you're a smarter man than i one gets the feeling we wander aimlessly from scene to scene just to move the film along to walken's next big line by the end of the movie you're actually wishing he'd blow his horn and make the walls of jericho fall on the people who made this un natural disaster br br bottom line it's an insult to our intelligence that they made a sequel to this film in the first place the original told the right story answered the questions that should have been and left alone the ones you were meant to ponder afterwards there are no compelling reasons to follow these characters that was in the first the priest who lost his faith the little girl who kept the big secret the teacher who protected her children even lucifer himself was more interesting by himself in the first film than all the other characters in the sequel put together i feel sorry for anybody who sees this film and not the first because they'll probably never want to watch the original and that's a real tragedy
<START> surreal film noir released soon after the real genre defining classics the maltese falcon double indemnity and the postman always rings twice welles films shouldn't be evaluated against others he was playing by different rules in fact he was playing this starts where other femme fatale films leave off so the vaguely logical but interesting whodunit is embellished with a display of wellesian scenes typical rapid fire style dialog lots of hard boiled philosophy and unusual acting good hayworth presumably intentionally one dimensional to welles genre may have meant formula but he seemed to like using mysteries as backgrounds for his entertainments
<START> whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in hollywood at all not even live there and those actors need to find another job the most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life and i only kept watching to see if it would get better which unfortunately for me it did not br br even at the end the credits gave me anxiety i guess there weren't a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly very slowly br br this movie is definitely a great how not to make a movie guide too bad i can't give a 0
<START> i had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at imdb and that's why i had avoided it today they showed vanilla sky on tv and as i had nothing better to do and as it turned out i would have had a hard time finding anything better to do vanilla sky is a frightening sad and touching movie actually one of the best i've seen in a while i was surprised by how i was affected watching it it's hard to explain but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey vanilla sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie or any media for that matter br br i really recommend everyone to watch this movie regardless of what you have heard about it
<START> i gave this a 1 there are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for total mayhem everyone gets killed or nearly so i am tired of cross hairs and changing views i cannot give the plot away convoluted and insane if i had paid to see this i would demand my money back i wish reviews were more honest
<START> an actor's first film is usually something one can afford to miss it's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display and this film is no exception br br but worse than that even by 1982 standards this is so bad it's hysterically funny filmed entirely in the chicago area on an obviously small budget most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff wooden and cartoonish a cross between a high school play and bad community theater noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialog and the dialog is truly bad very declarative in a way that comes off as forced and expedient rather than natural and organic scenes are contrived and choppy and even though the characters go through a span of years neither the children nor the adults age at all br br i do believe it's possible to make a christian film that's palatable to a large secular audience but too often the creators of such films are so focused on 'the message' or in this case their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are tossed aside i'm sure it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer director editor and cast member br br luckily michael madsen was much more interesting and believable to watch in his subsequent films careers like his are certainly not built on films like this one
<START> jean marc barr being light the big blue dogville has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy i might be wrong but i don't think this movie's part of the dogma '95 manifesto though it really looks like it i'm not really sure of what i think about this film all actors are good they deliver pretty good performances especially rosanna arquette and jean marc barr the story is somehow interesting but i don't know there's something about the movie that i don't like the sex scenes are way too long it goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of crap i don't know exactly where it stands sure it's not a bad movie but i won't suggest people to see it neither i'll tell them not to watch just do as you want if you feel curious and you're open minded give it a try you might like it
<START> spoilers on of the first wwii movies coming out of hollywood that shows how the war effected those gi's or in this case us marines who fought in it br br 21 year old al schmid john garfield was just starting to live with a well paying job earning some 40 00 a week at the local steel mill and girl ruth hartley elenore parker whom he was about to marry when the japs spoiled everything for him and millions of likewise young americans by attacking the us pacific fleet at pearl harbor doing his duty as an american citizen al immediately joined the us marine corps hoping to get back at the japs knowing correctly as it was to turn out that the marines would be the first american combat units to get a crack at them br br al finally got his chance when his unit the 1st marine division landed on august 7 1942 at guadalcanal in the far flung solomon islands to engage the japanese who were were in control of it it was during the battle of the ilu river that al almost single handed stopped a massive japanese banzai attack holding off with his machine gun wave after wave of suicide attacks by the determined japs until help or reinforcements finally arrived it was during the bloody fighting al was hit in the face by a jap grenade that ended up blinding him br br now back in the states convalescing at a naval hospital al is faced with something far more harder to overcome then battling a battalion size attack of japanese or german soldiers he's faced with a future where he'll never see again and having to depend on others to look after or for him br br we get to see in the film pride of the marines al battle himself far harder then he did the japanese troops on guadalcanal in just coming to terms with his disability not wanting anyone especially his girlfriend ruth to feel sorry for him al in fact is the one who feels sorry for himself more then anyone else in the movie it's with the help of navy nurse virginia pfeiffer rosemary decamp and ruth together with his us marine buddy lee diamond dane clark that in the end gives al the courage to face his blindness with the same strength that he faced wave after wave of japanese troops on gudalcanal a courage al thought he lost back in that god forsaken island hell in the south pacific br br based on the true story of us marine sergeant albert schmid pride of the marines showed what we were to expect from the tens of thousands of wounded us servicemen coming back from the war we get to see how it in many ways was far more difficult for those fighting the war to adjust to a peacetime america when they left something like in the case of al schmid behind on the battlefield al's battle with his personal demons was a lot harder then the japanese that he fought in that they were part of him and thus had to fight himself in order to overcome and eventually defeat them despite the help that he got from both nurse virginia and his girlfriend ruth as well as his navy doctor who has a striking resemblance to actor gregory peck it still was up to al to overcome the fears that he faced fears which he and only he had to both battle and overcome like he was told by everyone in the movie all by himself
<START> the dentist was made on the time when almost every profession had it's psycho we had mad police officers ambulance men secretery's and that was just for starters the dentist came suprisingly late because going to dentist is usually everyman's nightmare br br the plot is twisted super clean dentist doctor feinstone lives perfect life in his great white house he has beautiful blond wife and great place to work as a dentist dark clouds are coming to his horizon in the form of nasty irs guy terminator's earl boen dirty pool cleaner cleaning his wife and suddenly everyone's teeth seems to have gone through dark filter he goes nutso and starts to take care of people teeth in the nasty way and you don't want to come to his path br br crew were professional producer director brian yuzna had produced stylish horror movies like re animator and from beyond he directed the sequel to re animator and his first movie society was nice spinoff from john carpenter's they live film's producer pierre david is known from movies like scanners cast was great corbin bernsen really suprised me i knew him from la law and major league but i could newer dream him as a psycho dentist he was actually great in his role and he was kind of sad person linda hoffman was beutiful and dumb as feinstones wife micahel stadvec did not have much line's but after i saw him with ladies of the neighbourhood i knew my future profession ken foree dawn of the dead from beyond was nice sight as cop on the case virginya keehne was the innocent teen who is about to be next client to feinstone br br final warning if you're like me and have problem with dentist's then maybe you should skip this one but if you want to try than you should prepare yourself with dark humor and lots nasty drillings
<START> i have seen many many films from china and hong kong this is the worst no the worst one was 'unknown pleasures' i watched 'platform' yesterday evening and thought that jia zhang ke's other two films must be better this evening i was disappointed again i will not be watching 'xiao wu' tomorrow evening because i have just placed all three films in the bin whoever gave this film 'platform' ten out of ten needs to watch more cinema the photography was very poor it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters because of the lack of close up work the storyline was so disjointed that i fast forwarded it towards the end out of pure frustration i would not recommend this film to anyone give me zhang yimou or chen kage any day these are true masters of chinese cinema not pretentious con men
<START> okay so i've seen a lot of really odd unusual movies in my day fear and loathing in las vegas comes to mind when i think of that well not anymore from here on out whenever someone asks me hey what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen slipstream is what i'll say and i do not mean unusual in a good way br br from the very beginning of the movie it was obvious that this was going to be one of those trippy camera effect movies by that i mean little things like flashing images on the screen rewinding and fast forwarding people's words and scenes messing with the color on the screen flash forwards and flash backs constantly then you have the actual acting itself people randomly get violent shoot things people say the weirdest things that just don't make much if any sense br br the movie is about a writer who starts to intermingle real life with the book he's writing and for a lack of a better way to explain it you basically see this trip he goes on throughout the movie the thing is johnny depp went on a similar trip in fear and loathing in las vegas but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch not painful honestly i had a real hard time even finishing slipstream it kind of hurt my brain a bit br br i can see some film buff making a claim as to this movie having certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique but add to the feeling of dementia blah blah blah point is this movie hurts your brain when you watch it it makes very little sense it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is going on and even at the end the only thing you can be happy about is that it's over and you can say you actually sat through it so in closing if you want to see a movie that will have you saying what the heck over and over again both out loud and in your head go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check this out br br mr hopkins while i applaud you as an actor and commend your choice to take a stab at directing please do not ever make a movie like this again next time try something that relies a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache
<START> this is john waters best film to date the characters are obvious and symbolic just as in his other films so there are no surprises or character changes i enjoyed the film because of the wittiness and pace of the story it was good story telling with honest people
<START> man was i disappointed br br 1 adam arkin is more whiny than ross geller from 'friends' br br 2 a great cast is wasted kenneth mars alan arkin ed mcmahon pat morita louis nye with this amateurish script br br 3 the movie suffers from horrible pacing it jumps around through in a jumbled confusing manner br br 4 the story doesn't even make sense why does he want to break the football streak what about the stupid violin music none of it is explained br br 5 it's not even funny it's like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv saying lookit me lookit me i'm being funny this was a bad attempt at making another love at first bite br br i like larry cohen movies but man he failed here i couldn't wait for the credits to roll horribly disappointed
