<START> usually i'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighties early nineties film featuring now has beens but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through guys dressing up as girls has been done to death but never so pathetically corey haim's performance was abysmal as usual nicole eggert was not much better this has no redeeming qualities even if you are a number 1 fan of an actor actress in this piece of trash stay away
<START> no matter how you look at this movie it is just awful br br if you view it as a horror then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets br br if you look at it as a comedy then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame br br if it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a b ch br br if you look at it as an action you can't really pull for the whiny hero br br as you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining as mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a gremlins type movie this however has the worst looking monsters of that genre critters looked pretty good so did the ghoulies heck even the puppets from the munchies looked better than these the characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable the hero is a whiney security guard his girlfriend is always complaining they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend and another friend who is a spaz at one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes this movie is just utterly stupid i like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum which is obviously not a club but more likely a diner and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21 give me a break i am 25 and i look younger than any of them
<START> the title of this obscure and almost righteously forgotten 80's slasher inevitably reminds me of the cure's mega smash monster hit song with the same title hence a piece of the lyrics in the title section of this user comment also i didn't have anything else to say that was useful anyway but hey the forest isn't totally hopeless and not even that bad actually if nothing else at least it obeys the admittedly unwritten first rule of 80's slasher kill someone within the first 10 minutes of playtime sure you've heard about the basic premise of this film a dozen times before but don't let that discourage you from watching it as the forest has a couple of things more to offer than just an appealingly sinister cover image it's actually a bit of an atypical 80's slasher the main characters aren't ordinary brainless teenagers and the script has solid ambitions towards supernaturalism the concept isn't always successful let alone plausible but it's more than interesting enough to hold your attention and there are even are a couple of surprisingly strong moments of tension and plot twists to enjoy two married couples decide to go camping in the most isolated woods of california but due to a stupid bet the wives travel separately from their husbands barely set up for the night they receive uncanny visits from a mother looking for her two children the children themselves and finally the father who's out hunting for human flesh the demented family may be real or imaginary but the women are definitely in danger and by the time their husbands arrive they have already vanished the men too encounter the family and they find out more about the slightly dysfunction background the forest is a weird and unusual film to say the least it's not exactly a masterpiece of plotting but the thoroughly strange atmosphere will certainly appeal to open minded fans of 80's horror the murders are fairly gruesome and will filmed including a slit throat and a painful saw massacre and the filming locations are stunningly beautiful the more you contemplate about the story and its abrupt twists the less it makes any sense so my advice would just be to enjoy this odd viewing experience for as long as it lasts and not a minute longer the acting performances are just above average the music is okay and at least director donald jones also responsible for the 70's exploitation sickie schoolgirls in chains tried to be a little more creative that the majority of 80's horror films too bad it ultimately fails
<START> as with most of ben affleck's movies the comedy is dry and story is predictable that is if you want to call this a story many points were left connected with no thought at all i want to thank the director for not explaining the points better i say that because that would mean the torture would have lasted longer as for any of ben affleck's failures this one is no exception and is survivable only by the other actors even then the acting for the most part was contrived and was not believable the trip down memory lane with actors i have not seen in years was not worth the price of admission all thought it should be told they too are quickly joining the ranks of the has been my choice was to wait for my car to be fixed or watch this movie i made the wrong decision all in all i would give it a one laugh mainly because that is all i got out of it
<START> this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description but to me it was a bit of a let down very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed definitely not in sequential order also nothing of any consequence was being filmed i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer's part which is different from the typical hollywood film but this one befuddled me to no end i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didn't do anything for me i still don't really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person's life i guess he succeeded but i was looking for more needless to say i can't recommend this movie to anyone
<START> antwone fisher's story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children abandoned by a troubled mother antwone has never met his father growing up with church going abusers who use the n word not only to intimidate and hurt but also as a term of endearment as a young man witnessing how his best friend is killed in a hold up enduring racial slurs and being teased while serving in the navy antwone's anger is slowly turned into positive power when counseled by a navy psychiatrist and a love enters his life br br the scene where antwone meets his birth mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film stunned by the unexpected confrontation the woman listens in silence to hear the young man tell her how he has lived a life without crime addictions to drugs fathering children left and right all despite his utterly adverse circumstances br br if that scene wasn't powerful enough the very next one drives it home and opens the flood gates a reception to welcome home antwone dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that he is part of this great family br br one of the messages delivered by this wonderful film is that there are many well meaning and sincere people working to help orphans and unwanted children even if some of the homes and administrators don't seem to care and appear self serving many do give it their all the character who found antwone's file once he disclosed the circumstances of his birth is one of those bright lights in the darkness of the system br br the dvd includes a french language track various subtitle choices as well as additional features and information about foster parenting br br as a clevelander i appreciated the location footage no matter where you are from you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem
<START> i thought that this movie was pretty lame if you're looking for cheesey you may like this i myself don't mind a fair amount of cheese but this was ridiculous the progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak br br the only thing entertaining about this movie was the day glo zombies but even that isn't reason enough to see this flick
<START> della myers kim basinger is an upper class housewife that lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and her abusive husband kenneth craig sheffer della gives all the attention to the twins neglecting their house and her appearance and upsetting kenneth on the christmas eve she drives to the local mall in the night to buy wrapping paper for the gifts and she does not find any parking space available when she sees an old car parked on two spots she leaves a message to the owner calling him selfish jerk when the mall closes della's car is hold by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks Â chuckie lukas haas the afro american huey jamie starr the chinese american vingh leonard wu and the latin tomÃ¡s luis chÃ¡vez when the security guard of the mall protects her he is shot on the head by chuckie della speeds up her car trying to escape from the criminals however she crashes her truck nearby a forest while chased by the gang she takes the toolbox and hides in the wood fighting against the gang to survive br br a couple of days ago i saw the trailer of while she was out and i was anxious to watch the dvd unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie and i am totally disappointed with this dull and implausible collection of clichÃ©s della myers is presented as an insecure and neglectful housewife and inexistent as wife the motherhood is her only interest in her concept of family she is chased by four mean criminals but she defeats them with a toolbox that seems to be the batman's utility belt therefore the plot is so absurd that irritates the gang of criminals is formed by the favorite clichÃ© of american movies with an afro american a chinese american and a latin together with an american lord to be politically correct kim basinger has a decent acting but their children are too young for a fifty five year old woman my vote is four br br title brazil enquanto ela estÃ¡ fora while she was out
<START> here again is yet another diane lane movie where she cheats on her husband is this the only role she knows how to play this time it's set in 1969 and she cheats on her husband with the blouse man i am so not surprised because that is so very predictable then her husband gets mad and throws the milk i wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the milkman as well i wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too because this is a very boring movie then after some milk throwing she says sorry and sees the blouse man again duh then while she is making it with him her son gets stung by wasps my mom always told me not to throw rocks at a wasps nest this kids mom didn't have time to tell him that she was too busy with the blouse man
<START> awesomely improbable and foolish potboiler that at least has some redeeming crisp location photography but it's too unbelievable to generate much in the way of tension i was kinda hoping that stanwyck wouldn't make it back in time because really she was saddled with the wet in more ways than one husband and she had an idiot child as well why not run off with meeker but the nagging question remains what sort of wood was that pier support made of if a rotten piece of it pulled off didn't float stanwyck always impeccably professional does the best she could with the material but it's threadbare

<START> when i finally had the opportunity to watch zombie 3 zombie flesheaters 2 in europe on an import region 2 japanese dvd i was blown away by just how entertaining this zombie epic is the transfer is just about immaculate as good as it's ever going to look unless anchor bay gets a hold of it the gore truly stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx the sound is also terrific it's only 2 channel dolby but if you have a receiver with dolby prologic 2 you can really appreciate the cheesy music actually a very good score and the effective although cheap sound effects it never sounded so good and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment br br i never realized just how much blood flows in this film it's extremely brutal with exploding head shots exploding puss filled mega pimples a cleaver to a zombies throat a woman's burned off extremities how come it did'nt burn the guy also intestinal munching zombie babies and so much more i lost track br br this is no doubt for hardcore zombie action fans especially of the italian kind there is some excellent set pieces and cinematography to be found i think people don't give it enough credit if you see a clean print and not some horrendous pirate copy it's a whole other experience entirely br br this film never lets up for a second and i realize it's inconsistent plotwise the dubbing is horrible the acting is stiff and it's sense of irreverence is celebrated in grand fashion but that's part of it's charm br br to me this is one of the best horror films ever made you can't make a film this bad so good on purpose it's accidental genius of the highest order if they played it for laughs it would have been a disaster but they played it straight as an arrow and the result is a terrific cult classic that thumbs it's nose at any and all traditional moviemaking standards br br tons of action sequences exotic locales excellent set design good sometimes great cinematography wonderfully cheesy acting and inconsistent but still interesting plot great makeup effects beautiful women who can kick butt excellent music and sometimes hilarious sometimes creepy but always entertaining zombies how can you go wrong with this film it has it all a cult classic that stands the test of time
<START> this film is so bad dialogues story actors and actresses everything that it's hard to imagine that we'll see a worse movie this year or in the following years love's brother set in australia among italian immigrants has nothing but shallow clichÃ©s about italian culture to offer and it is quite telling that even the italians from and in italy speak english in the film the message of the film ugly people have to marry ugly people beautiful people have to marry beautiful people is truly discomforting giovanni ribisi is quite good in films like 'suburbia' or 'lost in translation' but here his pseudo italian accent is hard to bear see this film at your own risk trash as trash can
<START> absolute beginners was a film for the younger generation a multi time film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in britain and how these troubled constantly hitting each note teen's problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow it could have been dubbed the moulin rouge of the 80s but it disappeared it made its very shallow mark on the world snuck under the radar and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section the comedy section or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesn't need chain money to survive alas that wasn't where i found it Â but i found it watched it tried my hardest to sing along with it stared into bowie's eyes but found myself faded by the end did it not survive the test of time is 1950s london too far removed from our current society is bowie too creepy i think absolute beginners falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang but withers to a mere sparkle by the end br br absolute beginners opens with a huge number that takes us through the non gritty streets of london which involve theft nightly prostitutes on every corner dance throughout booze like rivers and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual sounds like a place we would all hate to be Â right director julien temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters the one we follow most is colin played by eddie o'connell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl suzette played by patsy kensit these two have chemistry and while suzette looks like a pre rehab lohan to me they worked there was a huge spark between them the chemistry was like lava and i believed that these two could take me down a road i had never traveled i was ready Â but then something happened temple takes us out of the nightlife takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first suzette runs away colin becomes a pervert and bowie Â well Â i am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain Â i can tell you that much temple gives us this flashy city this opportunity to see those that inhabit it but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger we learn about colin mainly but nobody else i could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom and what importance fashion had to that era also were they teens really Â they all seemed like they were pushing their late 20s but maybe it was my tv br br character development thrown right out the door temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about one of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example temple uses a split house to show us the lives of colin's parents of which i didn't know it was them until after the film and a song which screams apathy great song too many characters not enough time suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency and it just falls apart in your hands then if that wasn't enough we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs rubbing our noggin' trying to understand where our characters are or are going and temple throws in hatred anger and politics into the final act while i was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme i didn't think racism would be on the top of the bill suddenly friends are missing people are angry and there is some random guy running around fighting colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race somebody help me out here it seemed completely rushed and overwhelming Â nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off to me the ending of absolute beginners was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number that first part set the pace and temple could not keep up br br overall i must say that temple can direct a music video but i don't think he was quite prepared for the feature film i don't think this film will ever make it into full cult status and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come it is a fun film to watch initially but when we get to that final part it just explodes from the inside i wanted some cutting edge work but instead what i found was a freaky bowie coupled with characters i cared nothing for i could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s but by the end it just felt forced i think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to motivation by the ever freaky bowie in this film it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status i am glad that i watched this film once but that is all that my small brain can take i loved the way that temple caught me from the beginning but he couldn't control his characters way too many and the songs didn't seem to match the final moments of the film it came out of nowhere and it was unwelcomed if this was a film about racism it needed to be from the beginning absolute beginners was a welcomed adventure but i don't think i will be dusting this film off in the future br br grade out of
<START> this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous and i have never seen such bad acting in my life the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys especially drew fuller i don't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie i didn't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch i was very disappointed the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion
<START> almost as tedious to watch as it was to read evening is a gorgeously produced failure until meryl streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff vanessa redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying ann and claire danes is a cipher perhaps if vanessa and claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young ann that gave her entrÃ©e to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older ann actually was dying br br i was hoping the addition of michael cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas it gave me a headache
<START> after a chance encounter on the train a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna discussing life and love the primary reason to see before sunrise is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines as celine this sexy brainy soulful brown eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid twenties risking overstatement celine is practically the ideal woman unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural unpretentious introspective and selflessly loving we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak for her sincere intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating further her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing br br if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar ethan hawke as jessie comes off like a vaguely appealing slob sort of a maynard g krebs of the nineties attempting to appear detached and nonchalant he sort of drags himself through certain shots his pants fit poorly his tee shirt is coming untucked his wavy dark hair his most attractive feature needs a good washing and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee nevertheless he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two week train ride around europe so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine his oft cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence we know he is getting somewhere br br after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes bars and silly diversions they agree that because they may never see one another again they should make the most of it jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up br br given his boundless luck in the romance department it is especially irksome when jessie as the very definition of a naive jerk foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp he contents himself with a half baked plan quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu to reunite at the same spot in half a year when the appointed time comes you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another perhaps even married and pregnant for whatever reason she probably won't show while jesse who ends up working at target or if he's lucky the local library will go back to vienna desperate to see her again only to wind up alone br br despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion before sunrise is a beautiful movie i highly recommend both it and the sequel before sunset
<START> i found this film by mistake many years ago wondered then still do why it didn't get the acclaim it should have well written beautiful acting one ironic twist after another and there is plausibility in what the nefarious characters are attempting i would not recommend this film for people with short attention spans it requires sufficient intelligence to comprehend that there maybe a kernel of truth in this story
<START> well i come from bulgaria where it 's almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be very very afraid this guy devon sawa has done a great job with this movie i don't know exactly how old he was but he didn't act like a child well done now about the tornado it wasn't very realistic but frightens you if you want to have a nice time in front of the telly this is the movie
<START> some news reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about a epidemic of zombies despite the 'government controlling the media' the makings of the film don't understand that the george romero zombie films only worked because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films land of the dead withstanding this satire is about as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more apropos for this scenario what's subversive or subtle about seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction anything nuanced about the various commercials that are inter cut with the film nope furthermore the acting is uniformly horrible the characters thoroughly unlikable and the plot inane add this all up and you have the worst most incompetent zombie film since c h u d 2 reared it's hideous head br br my grade d
