<START> what is it is a mish mash of bizarre recurring motifs snails shirley temple swastikas and overtly racist music among others unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development the whole thing struck me as self consciously freak show and i don't mean only the unusual casting decisions it has the feel of a bad acid trip far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to hunter s thompson or william s burroughs the only movie to which i can compare it is eraserhead my second least favorite film of all time which was by intent much more depressing but i still found what is it a total waste of my time it's one thing to give me a peek into the inner workings of someone else's mind even someone else's chemically altered consciousness but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness
<START> i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn't take anymore it felt as though i'd watched dozens of episodes already and then it hit me there's nothing new here i've heard that joke on seinfeld i saw someone fall like that on friends an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline ect none of the actors are interesting here either some were good on other shows not here and others are new to a profession they should have never entered avoid this stinker
<START> this collection really sucks br br i rented it thinking iÂ´d really would enjoy some good fighting man this sucked quick flashy cuts an extremely annoying speaker and the fights them selves were heavily edited and shortened iÂ´m thinking especially of jet liÂ´s fight in fists of legend and jackie chanÂ´s fight from drunken master 2 br br and whatÂ´s the deal with those brawling streetfighters whatÂ´s so cool about that iÂ´ve seen more interesting fights on martial law br br this a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people br br do not ever buy this film do not encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this crap br br instead go buy the movies the fights were from and wath the fights in their uncut glory
<START> the story deals about jet li who has to fight against his old br br friends but there is one problem the friends are superfighters the film is filled with blood super action and the best stunts forever and lau ching wan is a great co actor of course the movie has the typical hk fun but i love it in germany black mask is uncut
<START> david duchovny and michelle forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to california but can't really afford to so they 'ride share with another young couple brad pitt and juliette lewis to save on expenses the idea is for them to stop at various murder sites along the way sites where serial killers did their thing since brian duchovny is a writer and carrie forbes is his photographer what they don't know is that pitt earley and lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever he says i don't care for pitt as a rule but he does justice to psycho roles the scary thing is that he does them so well i've actually known people like him before no not killers but with pretty much the same mindset anyway as the road trip goes along carrie guesses that the others are about out of money but earley seems to always come up with the cash somehow never mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though lewis does her role well one that she excels at a not too bright waif that has a good heart but doesn't understand that she doesn't have to put up with being beaten up by earley when she does something he doesn't like as things begin to get more unacceptable carrie insists that the other couple be put out at a gas station and unfortunately it's at that point where she's inside that she sees a news bulletin that tells her exactly who they've been ride sharing with after which things go downhill for them at a rapid clip this is not the greatest flick in the world but it's not bad i watched what was supposed to be the 'unrated' version but i wonder how much was cut out of the rated version because this seemed fairly tame to me really not that this makes it family fare or anything unless it's maybe the manson family 7 out of 10
<START> it was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its factÂ even by today's standards the film is interesting and provocativeÂ br br therese and isabelle are both attending the same girl's schoolÂ therese is energetic intelligent and becomes a mentor for the innocent naive sweet isabelleÂ she guides her through a number of exotic experiences including a trip through an exclusive brothel into her first lesbian liaison and indirectly into her first heterosexual experienceÂ br br the film does not exploit any sex nor is there an abundance of nudity the imagery is effective but sometimes the camera lingers too long and the story goes slowlyÂ br br the director radley metzger went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of henry parisÂ he always has extremely detailed stories good acting and very high standards of cinematography br br artistically however this is perhaps his most completeÂ his later attempts supplied for entertainment whereas therese and isabelle was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism
<START> an inconvenient truth is as entirely simplistic and demagogic as the turgid slop created by the rabid and idiotic republicans it meanders along intangible lines until it attempts to gorge something into your face namely that we'll all be dead in a few hundred years which is already indisputable but who cares humans are selfish destructive creatures i frankly do not waste my time caring about human extinction i'll just call it a natural progression let the apocalypse begin but meanwhile we have to listen to the same brazen slanted politicians who propose another new society well don't be fooled we'll all still be controlled by the wealthy by those in power and by those idiots who created the catastrophes in the first place nothing will ever change br br al gore whose hypocrisy is quite evident in the film as he is being driven in a gas guzzling car all alone using a consumerist computer he also lives on huge acres of land in a rather large mansion the land itself was used for destructive erosive purposes including cattle tobacco pig farming which accounts for methane gas traces and who knows what else his wealth is predicated on exploitation greed and his investments include numerous large companies in the world with disputable records i hardly think this man is qualified to lecture the less fortunate but his prestige is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party that is all meanwhile he emits those very same rancid characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling this bozo happens to be living the comfortable life and yet he's lecturing poor people in africa about crop farming and cut and burn techniques he travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting jets uses product placed computers in the documentary and yet he thinks everything is a moral issue he's entirely absorbed in his own deluded nightmares he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister from tobacco induced cancer and the near death of his son by an automobile of all things did he fight against the tobacco companies or propose that automobiles be banned because they are dangerous hulking machines no everything must serve the economy so why is he any different the answer is he is not br br his forlorn and exhausted attempts at humanistic philosophy are disastrous all this while he's being filmed in the forest or along a little river eschewing stale life affirming quotes well mr gore why don't you try living like the common people then he is a politician plain and simple he has a career invested in the power structure my question is why doesn't he concentrate on the powerful industrial nations of the earth who are to blame for most of the complications he doesn't do that because it would be unwise for investments stocks and corporations br br al gore gives monotonous lectures about the subject in the documentary namely to wealthy white people in the audience who clap on cue while showing them graph charts numbers and percentages and speaking in a dreary tone no one without a harvard which the elites control education can make sense out of it but he tells us everything is going to hell no kidding but i think he fails to account for this problem precisely in the approach that capitalism has taken for the planet namely that it is expendable and a waste dump he never once mentions how industrialization has created these problems he just wants to put mild bandages on them but not eradicate the whole oppressive system its obvious he was spoiled sent to the schools for elites and has the same basic temperament for politics as any other back stabbing inconsistent dullard in washington whoever made this propaganda as it is in no way different than what the republicans have conceived had only goals in mind that were directed by capitalistic impulse that is to say someone is going to benefit and it seems the new green politicians who support venture capitalist companies who are buying up hordes of land in an attempt to develop the new utopian future with new technologies it's the same old story al gore is a believer in the elitist structure he actually believes there is a democracy in the us which i find very naive if we aren't paying wages to the oil companies then we'll be paying them to the wind and solar companies br br i find the speech at the end quite rancid along the lines of something gw bush would have oozed over to the dumb downed masses gore speaks about people uniting together to defeat communism in the 1990's what it had to do with global warming absolutely nothing but he attempts to get base emotions ruminating in people with that said he didn't understand that communism never existed in the world the systems in europe and ussr were merely a tyrannical form of authoritarianism and capitalism no less different than what controls the us interests social ecology was not even mentioned here which is really a travesty if you want to change the world then one must dispose of those antiquated systems that are based on greed exploitation and violence
<START> once again i was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for 4 88 fifty percent of the time the movies i find in the bin are pure crap i mean horrible beyond belief but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good this movie is much better than i expected i found it very engaging though it was obviously made by an amateur br br the direction is nothing special but the story is intriguing with some good thrills i expected it to be more of a comedy but i wasn't too disappointed br br for a thriller this movie is surprisingly good natured there's no bloody violence no profanity no nudity no sex usually these movies require all four of those elements the pg rating is well deserved not like sixteen candles where the f word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene br br i just wish the romance between corey haim and his love interest could've been developed more the film does tend to be plot heavy and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them we end up watching a careless three minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors they end up kissing at the end but there's so little chemistry that it seems forced br br the dream machine is no gem but it's good clean entertainment it's quite forgettable especially with a cast of unknowns except for haim but it's also much better than you'd expect br br my score 7 out of 10
<START> in sixth grade every teacher i had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester every class had something to do with this terrible show we watched it in english and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters in math we talked about charts and other sea crap in science we talked about whales which was actually somewhat interesting so this wasn't a 100 waste of time all day everyday was torture not only that but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well i could see if this was a new series or something but it was like '93 i'm still trying to block this out
<START> ettore scola is one of the most important italian directors my parents and i watched together c'eravamo tanto amati on a summer night we liked it but we didn't love it as we loved a special day i believe ettore scola is pretty underrated we often forget to remember him maybe because his latest films were disappointing and so yesterday night my mum and i sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece writing direction cinematography score and production design were sober and accurate but the thing i liked the most was the chemistry between loren and mastroianni they're both excellent actors and play the main roles of antonietta and gabriele antonietta is an housewife married with a fanatic fascist she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families gabriele is simply an anti fascist they spend together a special day that special day of 1938 when hitler came to rome visiting mussolini i don't want to spoil anymore about the plot go looking for this film
<START> this was a marvelously funny comedy with a great cast john ritter and katey sagal were perfectly cast as the parents and the kids were great too kaley cuoco was a good choice to play bridget who was sort of a toned down version of kelly bundy from married with children the writing and performances were both first rate br br sadly john ritter died during the series and it put a damper on things they had to scramble to change the show and bring in more cast members and it was obviously an uncomfortable situation but they handled it well james garner was a good addition it could have lasted longer had ritter lived br br i especially loved it when they brought in ed o'neill in a guest spot that was great br br out of
<START> in my line of work i occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film when i can i take a look at these low budget films and often they make me think that the future of hollywood is going to the dogs once in a while though there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible the short film b r o k e n directed by alex ferrari is a genuine surprise and worth a second look br br clocking in at a scant 20 minutes b r o k e n tries to tell a compelling but surreal story with almost no back story the audience is plopped down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening a young woman samantha jane polay awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home when she awakes she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book these nasty guys and girls are larger than life they are all guns and knives there is no way out br br the kicker here is that despite being a low budget film it doesn't play like one from the very beginning the feeling is that b r o k e n has been shot edited and produced by professionals it looks like something quentin tarantino might have done on his day off when he was jamming with the wachowski brothers the film is sharp and cool it looks good and it feels like something big br br the acting is much better than i usually see in these smaller films polay and paul gordon who plays the head killer duncan were well chosen as two of the few speaking roles in the film it is up to them to carry the film no special effects no matter how good would have saved this film from bad acting thankfully polay manages to convey true fear and gordon manages to come off as a real psycho some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent but it hardly shows br br the downside to b r o k e n is that it's only 20 minutes long the story ends with a twilight zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle watching it i felt like i was supposed to have some epiphany but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than i had hoped it would be the film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop but it comes off as unsatisfying i keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film br br my rating 8 out of 10
<START> this is the absolutely worst piece of crap i've ever had to watch actually it was so bad that i just had to watch it br br the cgi is sooo bad it's fun it's not even close to the shitty cgi animations in spawn that's how bad it is har har har br br i'm amazed over the fact that some distribution company actually has put money down to release this on dvd but i guess they'll get more money out of it that way 'cos the cost of making it can not have been more than a few hundred dollars br br it's so awful that a kindergarten class could have made it br br see it and laugh
<START> i was very surprised how much i enjoyed this film i thought it was funny sexy painful and warm andie macdowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable for once the director of a macdowell film did not make her beauty another character in the film the romance between kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life imelda stalinson who has been a mvp in so many british films does a great job in this there is some tragedy in this but i think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting clean direction and witty writing the film quality is excellent and the music is good too though unavailable on sound track
<START> most people who have seen this movie thinks that it is the best movie ever made i disagree but this movie is very very good tony is a bad ass guy and knows that he's intimidating and uses it to get ahead it's about him and how he goes from washing dishes to having a huge house and a office with cocaine all over the desk if you want a family movie then this isn't the way to go but if you want mobsters and vengeance and stuff like that then you'll like it
<START> surprisingly good the acting was fun the screenplay was fun the music was cheesie fun the plot was stupendously fun this was a fun movie to watch and to give your brain some rest parts of the plot and quotes i found to be very creative 7 out of 10 actually for what it was it would deserve a 10 out of 10 you are not supposed to compare this to an arthouse film or to a bloody slasher film
<START> i own 2 home entertainment stores and i've seen a lot of bad movies in my time but this one was so bad it compelled me to register here and comment on it how bad was it let's just say that sofia coppola deserved an oscar for her performance in godfather iii when compared to giada colagrande's in this movie br br it was robotic and uninspired her lover has just died one month prior to her arrival at the 'rubber house' he had given her once there she discovers he has cheated on her throughout her relationship but none of it seems to register with her within a day she starts a relationship with leslie dafoe the caretaker of the house even though she is married to dafoe off screen her scenes with him were cold and unemotional br br if there was a plot i missed it not even willem dafoe could save this movie from the amateur cinematic train wreck that it is
<START> this is by far the worst movie i've ever seen from the plot though the shots the special effects the acting and did i mentioned the plot every single thing in it sucked ass br br this is a good example of what over doing means and i'll try to explain br br i understand what the creator of this movie was trying to do this was supposed to be one of those movies you can't really tell what the hell is going on up until the end you sit mesmerized not knowing who's dead and who's alive and who killed who and why and just when you think you got the timeline right you find out you're wrong and the movie ends leaving you with an opened mouth for the next 5 minutes something like unbreakable or the job if you know what i mean br br but olga levens the writer of this junk yes olga Â the writer director producer screenplay author caster production designer art director costume designer and also a double for one of the characters is some scenes this is basically a one woman movie and when it comes to olga levens from levens productions you can't go wrong br br well this might come as a shocker but this time olga over did this big time jumping from scene to scene from dreams to reality but wait this was all a dream after all or was it the picture fades and i realized none of this ever happened the girl was all alone on the ship actually there was no ship no wait there's the ship again and the guys they're alive thank god no they're calling her to join the cruise but then the ship disappears so maybe they're dead after all or maybe they never were alive to begin with br br if you understood what i just said you might like this movie otherwise it's a boring piece of work and the only reason i set through this entire crap is to find out how the hell can they finish this movie br br don't watch this if you value time ever 90 minutes are a waste in this case
<START> this could be well have been the definitive film noir of all time had not the columbia studios cut so much of orson welles's original what we are left with is a flawed yet brilliant film that showcases the overwhelming talent of welles as an actor director and rita hayworth as a serious dramatic talent br br 'the lady from shanghai' is film noir at it's most sizzling and confusing welles with an uneven accent portrays michael o'hara a journeyman irishman who after a fateful encounter with the seductive dangerous elsa bannister hayworth in a great performance finds himself virtually coerced into accepting a job as a crewman on her and her crippled husband's everett sloane yacht elsa or 'rosalie' as michael likes to call her plays the innocent helpless doll very well ensnaring o'hara in her web as the lovers conduct a not so secret affair at sea arthur bannister's partner in his law firm george grisby glenn anders comes aboard he is a weird untrustworthy figure who offers michael a unique proposal he will get 5000 to assist grisby in the faking of grisby's death so it looks murder the plan is for michael to get off a technicality and run off into the sun with elsa but things do not go to plan br br hayworth delivers us one of the best femme fatales of all time in a very ambiguous portrayal at times she seems genuinely vulnerable and child like at others brutal world weary and hard always she is brilliantly beautiful whether he situation calls for her to be dripping wet in a swimsuit or dressed in black brandishing a gun hayworth is beautifully photographed here and she is a far cry from her famous 'gilda' role her then husband orson welles cut off her trademark auburn locks for a dyed blonde crop angering columbia boss harry cohn it was a terrific marketing ploy and he change suits her changed attitude wonderfully she is not the sympathetic femme fatale that 'gilda' is here instead she is a predatory black hearted dame who sees murder as a very useful option br br the welles and hayworth pairing came at a time when the couple were having extreme difficulties in their marriage they would divorce after the film was made so this is also a curiosity for providing some view into the complicated relationship they are hateful not romantic lovers in this so it's hard to gauge whether or not they had real chemistry on screen certainly every encounter is potent and filled with raw sexuality with welles as the 'fall guy' he even admits it himself in the film and rita as the double crossing babe br br welles character is the typical noir 'drifter' with not much sense as welles voice over proves to use o'hara indeed does not use his brain very much 'expect to be thinking of her elsa ' welles usually played intelligent charismatic fellows so his turn here as the dim witted michael is unusual and very interesting indeed welles was an actor of fine talent and he pulls off it well br br everett sloane is suitably slimy as hayworth's crippled husband one wonders why he hires michael it is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically so why does he invite a 'threat' on board one interpretation could be that michael provides the 'service' to his wife that bannister cannot in his crippled state there is definitely something to that theory with a lot of implications toward elsa's behaviour before she met her husband was she some sort of prostitute and grisby's knowledge of bannister's most intimate secrets being hinted at in several scenes br br this is a jumbled convoluted film with a plot that is ultimately flawed we are more interested in the love triangle than the murder plot as with most noirs welles provides us with many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches including the justifiably famous 'hall of mirrors' climax it's a terrific scene one ending that can almost obliterate the faults earlier on in the movie and lift it into greatness this fun house scene is visually stunning with a dali like feel to the painted sets apparently orson painted them himself subtle visual imagery utilized throughout the film by welles enhances the plot and makes this a thought provoking experience br br the dialogue is scorching and confusing delivered superbly by rita's alternately breathy low voice and helpless high pitched little girl voice hayworth proves her acting capabilities in this one and proves that she is the ultimate femme fatale of 'noir' it's a pity only a slight one as rita was a brilliant dancer that she did so many delightful yet frothy and often forgettable musicals for columbia in the 40's instead of darkly themed noir like this she was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show off her talent br br 9 10
