<START> many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow although the story line was rather typical of clara's later silents i still find it somewhat heart stirring and incredibly fun clara plays a happy go lucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves never mind that this man is married clara's lack of modesty was shocking in the day but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie though definitely not a brilliant story line quite typical actually this movie is a nice showcase of clara's ability to make the audience laugh
<START> the sopranos is arguably the greatest show in dramatic television history br br its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence sublime writing or first rate performances br br across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality centering around the life of one tony soprano a man who lives in two families one is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge new jersey mafia group of which he is the boss of both played by james gandolfini of true romance and the mexican fame tony is a fascinating scary but also likable guy full praise must be given to gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man contemporay american drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as tony br br the cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like paulie walnuts and ralph cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever br br the true genius of this tale however is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series twenty minute long dream sequences powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love honour and respect for family the series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous br br with tv now competitive and often poor the sopranos stands tall above the rest as america's most original and compelling drama forget family redifined this is television redifined
<START> saxophonist ronnie bowers dick powell wins a studio contract and goes to hollywood he stays at hollywwod hotel of course at the same time big egotistical star mona marshall lola lane has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture in a panic the studio hires lookalike virginia rosemary lane to impersonate her and have bowers take her to the premiere not telling him it's not marshall naturally they fall in love you can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself br br the plot is old to put it nicely but powell and rosemary lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices the score is good highlighted by hooray for hollywood and director busby berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive in musical sequence with edgar kennedy doing his patented slow burn also glenda farrell has a few funny bits as monas sister jonesie br br still the movie isn't that good the rest of the cast mugs ferociously and most of the humor is just not funny lola lane especially is just lousy trying to play mona for comedy also there is racism a stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and there's some truly appalling racist humor at one point that's probably what keeps this off tv most of the time i realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting today br br all in all a so so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs i give it a 7
<START> i wasn't sure how to rate this movie since it was so bad it was actually very funny i'm not a gackt fan by any means though he is talented despite the weird pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball i always thought hyde was talented though faith is an interesting album br br but on topic here folks this movie is ridiculous it's so over the top and nonsensical it's almost like a parody of supernatural action films br br the movie has almost no plot here except it's just about vampires with gangster friends in a way this film almost reminded me of spider man 3 with how there were too many ideas which resulted in not enough time to pay attention on one of them br br the action scenes were laughable quickly edited almost hard to understand with choreography that's so laughably bad though hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes but that's this film's only such redemption i'm a sucker for good action movies but the action was horribly done though the final shootout was ok and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie br br it keeps jumping between genres not a good thing it wants to be a drama or an action flick or a horror or a romance what the hell br br if this review is making you mad why is it because gackt and hyde are your love don't fool yourself this movie is bad
<START> oh for crying out loud this has got to be the lamest movie i've seen all year and i'm sorry the normally awesome john cusack was even involved in this brainless twitty piece of stupidity where sleepless in seattle delivered what amounts to be the same message albeit on a more subtle somewhat more mature level serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer and then proceeds to pound it into your psyche for the next tedious hour and a half or so and that's an hour and a half of my life i'll never get back again thank you very much it's bad enough the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity level of fourteen year olds actually i've known better fourteen year olds except maybe for jeremy piven who was enjoyable enough just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie where kate beckinsale's character plays that annoying silliness of a game about throwing all sensibility to the wind literally had my best friend and i irritated beyond belief i told my husband rockstar had more intelligence and at least the characters in rockstar weren't half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this serendipitous mess it's annoying to watch protagonists who seem to have no clue about choice in their lives and feel they're nothing more than puppets to destiny and the whims of fate how utterly tiresome i'm sure this movie will be more likely enjoyed by those who'd rather not engage in the chaotic messiness of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with the consequences after all here's a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after wreaking havoc and misery on two other people's lives namely their respective fiancÃ©es not to mention other relatives and friends just to get there br br
<START> i am a big fan of karishma kapoor and govinda i watched this film after i had seen fiza which was absolutley brilliant br br there are films that are bad and there are films that are cr p but this film just takes the biscuit br br we were so annoyed that we were conned out of paying our money expecting a decent film br br avoid at all cost dont even rent it br br 1 10
<START> i wasn't born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily i managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90's and the rest is history i was hooked the premise was pretty simple two hardened nemesis agents richard barrett and craig stirling william gaunt and stuart damon are partnered up with an expert if not young doctor and biologist sharron macready to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china whilst making their escape their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come br br the series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and i guess it was its relatively short lived one season run that has set it up for cult status br br monty berman the producer was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets particularly in episodes such as happening a studio deputising for the australian outback and the 'snow' sets of operation deep freeze and the beginning but if you can get past this and focus on the characters and the story lines the show was really a lot of fun it had a great mix of adventure and plenty of deadpan humour mainly from some terrific one liners from william gaunt br br the chemistry from the three leads was fantastic you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show and laugh about anthony nicholls awful wig they all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine i have to say i was always a richard barrett fan i loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge he was certainly a man you didn't cross and those eyes the bluest eyes you would probably see on tv i have also followed bill gaunts career with interest since however craig stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and i am sure alexandra bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too br br the show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with including donald sutherland jeremy brett peter wyngarde burt kwouk anton rodgers kate o'mara jenny linden paul eddington and colin blakely br br notable episodes for me were auto kill the interrogation the fanatics the mission and the gilded cage but i am sure every one has their personal favourites br br if you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time or to re watch it after many years remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and i don't think i will ever tire of it br br enjoy
<START> this is the kind of film for a snowy sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you descend into a big arm chair and mellow for a couple of hours wonderful performances from cher and nicolas cage as always gently row the plot along there are no rapids to cross no dangerous waters just a warm and witty paddle through new york life at its best a family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received
<START> what a fascinating film even if it wasn't based on real life forbidden lies was a fascinating portrait of a con artist in her element and it is the kind of film psychology students could study to learn about compulsive liars br br the author of forbidden love norma was revealed as a fraud in the media but this move really does give her ample opportunity to clear her name br br but the twists and turns she takes the documentary maker through are amazing what a patient woman i loved this movie i have not read the book but simply heard good reviews and went to see it on boring rainy afternoon the journey this film takes you on is clever interesting and totally engrossing
<START> born raised and educated in scotland i was appalled at this disgusting portrayal of a man who was no more nor less than a cattle rustler worse yet the thread of the entire movie was sex in one form or another by implication or verbally to view it one would think that 18th century scotland was populated by a bunch of sex perverts and homosexuals lange was a joke acting as the young mother at age 49 but liam neeson was even worse taking a bath in a scottish loch is not commonplace as they portrayed him but it did give them yet another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually driven we were save your money and watch pinnochio
<START> dr mordrid what can i say jeffrey combs has done it again br br anton mordrid has been on earth for 100 years waiting for kabal an evil sorcerer to come so he can kill him mordrid and kabal used to train together as kids so mordrid knows all kabal's tricks br br the film as a little bit confusing at begin with but soon you feel a part of the action i won't give away the ending so go and watch doctor mordrid br br i found the film to be very enjoyable because it doesn't have a lot of violence in nor sexual scenes the film focused on the plot and that's what i like i find the best films are the ones where times seems to fly by this is because you are so engrossed in the film doctor mordrid is a fantasticly engrossing movie i give it a 20 out of 10 worth seeing br br
<START> i am very surprised by the positive comments because there were four of us that saw this at one screening and we all walked out we personally felt that it was painfully slow to watch and couldn't sit through the whole movie and we really tried to stick with it in particular those in the group who really wanted to like it because of their personal experiences with sexual orientation alienation in the school years depicted didn't like or identify with it at all br br that said it is great to see that this film really resonated with a lot of people here on the boards and with reviewers that's the beauty of the subjective art form of film
<START> the bat people is a really bad film that deserved the mst3k treatment just as well like that other film the creeping terror br br in it we are in some sort of mountainous terrain full of bats we see many things happen like bats flying out and attacking and stuff station wagon chases mishaps at the emergency room and much more all this plus the cheesy mediocrity of the 1970s hey think mitchell here making the bat people actually one of the very best of the last mystery science theater 3000 episodes made in the series moviewise it's awful it should be avoided like the plague unless tom servo and crow are watching with you br br the bat people more like the bad people lol br br 1 10 of course
<START> a routine mystery thriller concerning a killer that lurks in the swamps during the early days of television this one was shown so often when dad would say what's on tv tonight and we'd tell him strangler of the swamp he'd pack us off to the movies we went to the movies a lot in those days
<START> by 1987 hong kong had given the world such films as sammo hung's encounters of the spooky kind' chow yun fat in john woo's iconic a better tomorrow' zu warriors' and the classic mr vampire' jackie chan was having international success on video but it was with a chinese ghost story' that hk cinema had its first real crossover theatrical hit in the west for many years br br western filmgoers had never seen anything like it it was a film that took various ingredients that hk cinema had used for years flying swordsman wildly choreographed martial arts and the supernatural and blended them to create a film that was unique in its look feel and execution forget the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned this is the original and best br br director siu tung ching still best known as an action choreographer on such films as woo's a better tomorrow 2' 'the killer' has under the watchful eye of legendary producer tsui hark created a masterpiece of fantasy horror cinema and with such an expert crew at his disposal no less than 6 martial arts coordinators the chances of the film being anything but wonderful would be unthinkable br br the editing by the amazingly prolific david wu who wrote directed the bride with white hair 2' and edited such classic titles as a better tomorrow 1 2 3' hardboiled' and the cult hit the club' is quite simply a work of genius his crafting of the perfectly choreographed high flying tree climbing sword fights makes them some of the best hk cinema has ever created fast moving outlandish but never confusing they are even today the pinnacle of their art br br the crew of cinematographers have also done miracles this is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting where wonderful blue tinged night sequences shrouded in an ever present ghostly fog are the breathtaking platform for our story to unfold it's a film where everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty even the silken robes and dresses worn by hsiao tsing become living parts of the movie whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes the ever present silk flows across the screen even a simple scene where hsiao tsing changes robes is turned into a thing of fluttering beauty as every skill on the set combines to create a most memorable scene from such a simple act the sets are also amazing giving an other worldly sense to the forests and the temple and harshness to the scorched flag filled wasteland of hell for the amazing finale the production design by zhongwen xi deserves the highest praise br br another major factor to the films success is the music by romeo diaz and james wong hong kong films have given us some fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of a sequence but on a chinese ghost story' the music is quite simply vital from the opening song onwards the music becomes as important as the characters br br the score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional instruments drums bells and guitars pound away over the action sequences to great effect but it's in the slower achingly romantic pieces that it comes into it's own here flutes strings and female choral effects create what are possibly the finest pieces of music heard in an hk film add to this the female vocal stunningly beautiful song that plays over tsau shen's and hsiao tsing's love making nothing is ever seen but the effect is wonderful this is lovingly innocent movie romance and you have a shining example of the power a film's music can have br br and we of course have the acting talent leslie cheung a better tomorrow 1 2' and a very popular singer is outstanding as the innocent tax collector his work in the thankfully mild comic sequences is never over the top and his scenes with joey wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence br br joey wang who would later be mostly relegated to support roles in films like the chow yun fat andy lau classic god of gamblers has never looked more radiant than how she does here she is the epitome of ethereal beauty her portrayal of the tragic hsiao tsing is stunning she shows her characters sadness at what she has become and what she is made to do but also gives off a subtle eroticism in the scenes where she is luring the men to their gruesome deaths veteran actor wu ma mr vampire' swordsman' is great fun as the wise brave but ever so grumpy yen he treads a fine line between the eccentric and the annoying with practised ease and what so easily could have been a character that could have harmed the film is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorable br br but what about the monsters and beasties i hear you cry well they range from the rather crude but fun stop motion animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple resulting in a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to munch on the amusingly unsuspecting tsau shen to the rather cheesy but surprisingly effective lord black complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads and quite outstanding wire work most of which has to this day never been topped br br but the most outstanding effect and creation is the tree spirit's killer tongue we first encounter this thing with an evil dead' style rushing camera effect as it powers down its victims throats to deliver a lethal french kiss that turns the victims into zombiefied husks but later it's shown in all its crazy glory it can grow so big and long that it shoots through the forest after prey rips apart trees wraps itself around buildings and coils it's slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks it can even split open to reveal a fang filled mouth it's an outrageous idea that given the deeply romantic main plot shouldn't work but it does to fantastic and unforgettable effect br br so what all this adds up to is a classic example of hong kong movie making a true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie it's a film packed with wit invention action monsters martial arts ghosts fantastic ideas lush visuals beautiful music and most important to it's enduring charm one of cinemas most moving romances
<START> loonatics unleashed is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by chuck jones the loony tunes have many spin offs and different versions some were good others not very much but loonatics it's the worst the concept is stupid and derivative of shows as the power rangers and teen titans there wasn't any similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made the new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic this show just doesn't work this horrible waste of animation is a complete failure and this shouldn't have be nothing more than a bad joke lame zero stars
<START> this amazing oscar winner 4 in total and john ford's first academy award winner is simply spellbinding with a pounding score by max steiner called an art film because ford had very little money to make this great story about guilt and retribution and greed and stupidity but what makes this movie such a classic is the direction and astounding photography and use of fog and lighting that was so different from the usual american film and more in the tradition of german expressionism and the oscar winning performance by victor mclaglen as the drunken gypo is simply unbelievable basically the movie takes place in ireland and gypo turns in a friend in the rebel movement to the english to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend but having all that money he starts blowing it on an all night drunk and giving it away while the leaders of the movement are trying to track down the informer the whole movie is one night in a dark and foggy ireland and a cast of characters that are memorable but all along the whole world of gypo is closing in on him both psychologically if i had to pick maybe three directors to have all their movies on a deserted island forever and nobody elses john ford would certainly be one of them what a truly remarkable movie
<START> i have never understood the appeal of this show the acting is poor debra jo rupp being a notable exception the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring the dialogue is weak the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny clichÃ©d scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that both happy days and the wonder years employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible pathetic excuse for a show
<START> i love dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment i remember lee from other dracula films from when i was younger and i thought he was great but this movie was really bad i don't know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing lee was the ultimate dracula with style looks attraction and the evil underneath that or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me br br but can you imagine dracula with an snobbish english accent and the body language to go along with it do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension then this is a movie for you br br otherwise don't see it i only gave it a 2 because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie br br sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid and i think that sums up the whole thing br br or maybe you like this film because of it's place in dracula cinema history perhaps being fascinated by how the dracula story has evolved from nosferatu to what it is today cause as movie it isn't that appealing it doesn't pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the vampyre myth so fascinating br br and furthermore it has so much of that tacky 70ies feel about it the scenery looks like cheap theatre and i don't say that rejecting everything made in the 70ies cause i can love old film as well as new
<START> this movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie the main character was decently done and i felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of backstory however everything else sucks the director emmanuel is quite incompetent at film making he uses some of the most idiotic shots ever br br a couple of random sequences of random images dispersed throughout the film i don't know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic but he wasn't it was stupid random shots of the trailer the main character lived in random buildings random pan shots of buildings random cat which walks away wtf and clouds lots of gloomy dark clouds br br he really liked this technique of having a scene cut up into different shots rather than being just one continuous shot ex guy is trying to light his weed and the camera circles around him instead of just one shot he edits it into like 10 different shots so its really edgy and hip and smart stupid br br the acting is horrible but it's what makes the movie so funny and the scarecrow is a gymnast cause he flips and spins and twirls all the time and some of the deaths could have been better you expect the main bully to have a long well built up death but nope a simple corncob in the ear the love interest was hot voluptuous which is why this movie gets a 2
