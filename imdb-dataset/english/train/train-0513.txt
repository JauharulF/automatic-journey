<START> a cinderella story made for adults who live in dreamland the romance is very unrealistic fluttery lovey dovey perfect etc the cinderella plot till the very end and shahid kapoor is the only reason for my stars if you're looking for a dreamy romance with a twist this is definitely you're movie but for the rest of us real world people i'd highly recommend saving your three hour watch time wake up people br br four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film we had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes maybe i'm missing something i just can't believe a movie like this can beat a classic like hddcs
<START> i don't know if this is a sitcom or not but i agree that this is one of the greatest television shows ever it's great that this show still airs and i love michelle it's cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she talked and she sometimes said something funny aw br br this show can relate to children and teens and well families as they struggle through rough times and try to work it out as a family i don't know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone br br i love the episode when i think her name is dd the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt and she learned a lesson about stealing that was a great episode an example that this tv show shows the family working things out as a family br br i recommend this show for everyone
<START> checking the spoiler alert just in case br br perhaps one of the most horrendous movies i have ever seen mazes and monsters felt like i wasted 101 minutes of my life the only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious but just ended up being funny since they were so bad evil dead anyone unfortunately for m m fortunately for us it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy this movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character robbie played by hanks encountered throughout the film it ended up being a fear mongering video about stereotypes that helped fuel the d d is the devil movement in the 80s br br if you want to avoid wasting your time and money steer clear of this junk br br p s even though the cover looks kinda interesting which is why i guess my brother bought it it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm unless you consider new england or new york city to be such a place
<START> sam thomas cavanagh and gray heather graham are devoted siblings who share an apartment and a love of many things ballroom dancing 1940s movie musicals and much to their surprise an attractive woman named charlie bridget moynahan historically heterosexual gray is confused by her new feelings br br gray matters proves to be one of the blandest films i have ever seen it's dull predictable unfunny poorly acted and poorly written nothing about it felt real and everything was very cheesy also this isn't really a romantic comedy with a special twist but more of a coming out movie sue kramer tried to make the first half cute with the romantic stuff and the second half serious with the actual acceptance and coming out part unfortunately she failed miserably the first half was largely unfunny and only heather graham was able to hold it up a little then the film took an awkward tone and got all serious the serious scenes were handled poorly and all of the emotions just felt phony br br i guess i would have enjoyed the film a little more if the relationships between the characters felt more authentic the brother and sister relationship was very weak and they didn't really appear to be that close their relationship just didn't feel very natural also the relationship between tom and bridget felt very unnatural if two people are going to get married after only knowing each other for less than a week then you would expect to see a little more excitement but the characters talked about getting married in vegas in the same manner of asking a waiter what the specials are there was a lack of excitement in the film and it was hard to get involved with the movie with such unmotivated characters br br the acting was mostly weak which was a bit surprising given the decent cast heather graham gave the only good performance in the movie she was funny and had a few charming scenes but it's too bad that all of her co stars were complete duds bridget moynahan was very weak and her performance ringed false on every level also it seemed like she was reading her lines thomas cavanagh was pretty wooden and he showed nearly no emotion the chemistry between thomas and heather was non existent and that damaged the film because their relationship felt phony i can usually rely on molly shannon to be funny in a supporting role but here she was just annoying sissy spacek had about two scenes and she was annoying in both of them finally alan cumming just had an embarrassing character and his performance wasn't very good overall gray matters is a lame film and it isn't worth watching rating 3 10
<START> the movie uses a cutting edge title for a lame story kill kill would have been nice the movie incorporates taboo scenes to make the viewer move back in their chairs the scenes are unnecessary and choppy the movie is something a novice screen writer could have conjured just a waste of movie props and network money i have to write 10 lines of text to critique this film when it is not worth 10 lines of my time but i have to push on to let the people know to avoid the nonsense if people are counting on you to choose a good movie for movie night pick something else if you have a soul don't damage it by subjecting yourself to this filth
<START> academy award winner robert redford best director ordinary people 1980 captures the majesty of the montana wilderness and the strength of the american family in this acclaimed adaptation of norman macleans classic memoir br br craig sheffer stars as the young norman and brad pitt stars as his brother paul an irresistible daredevil driven to challenge the world br br growing up both boys rebel against their stern minister father tom skerritt br br while norman channels his rebellion into writing paul descends a slippery path to self destruction br br also starring emily lloyd as wild hearted jessie burns br br the film won an academy award for best cinematopghaphy in 1993
<START> this movie is so cheap it's endearing with ron liebmann major vaughn providing the most entertaining on screen diatribes in film history i own 2 copies of this movie on video on one ralph macchio is caught actually cracking up in the background at major vaugn while he is ranting at hash obviously they forgot to edit this mistake out of the film but it goes to show just how funny the movie is when the actors themselves can't keep a straight face
<START> i am always so frustrated that the majority of science fiction movies are really intergalactic westerns or war dramas even star wars which is visually brilliant has one of its central images a futuristic gang that couldn't shoot straight imagine your coming upon about 600 people with conventional weapons most of them having an open shot and they miss br br i have read much science fiction and wish there were more movies for the thinking person forbidden planet one of the earliest of the genre is still one of the very best the story is based on a long extinct civilization the krell who created machines which could boost the intelligence of any being by quantum leaps unfortunately what they hadn't bargained for is that the brain is a center for other thoughts than intellectual the primitive aspect of the brain the id as freud called it is allowed to go unchecked it is released in sleep a bad dream come to corporeal existence walter pigeon dr morbius is the one who has jacked his brain to this level and with it has built machines and defenses that keep him barely one step ahead of the horrors of the recesses of his own mind his thoughts are creating horrors that he soon will not be able to defend the krell a much superior species could not stop it it destroyed them the landing party has never been of great interest to me the rest of the actors are pretty interchangeable ann francis is beautiful and naive and certainly would have produced quite a reaction in the fifties adolescent male her father's ire is exacerbated by her innocence and the wolfy fifties' astronauts for they are more like construction workers on the make than real astronauts they are always trying to figure out dames the cook is a great character with his obsession for hooch robbie the robot has much more personality than most of the crew and one wonders if mr spock may not be a soulmate to the literal thinking of this artificial creature the whole movie is very satisfying because the situation is the star morbius can't turn back and so he is destined to destroy himself and everything with him there are few science fiction films that are worth seeing more than once this is one that can coast right into the 21st century
<START> superman and the mole men is quite possibly superman's toughest adventures ever br br lois lane and clark kent are sent to silsby home of the world's deepest oil well while there some radioactive mole men come up through the oil well and explore the town jeff corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men can superman change the people's ways in time to save the mole men can superman warn the people in time about the radioactive danger the mole men bring br br in my opinion superman and the mole men is a very intelligent well written and well acted movie even though we only get to see superman fly once briefly it still makes a great superman adventure a must see for anyone br br 10 10 stars
<START> kurt russell is strong and mostly silent in this futuristic action thriller from paul anderson event horizon resident evil set on a garbage dump planet soldier plays like a cross between rambo and shane with russell barely speaking as the title character an obsolete genetic soldier left for dead the supporting cast of colonists including connie nielsen sean pertwee and a surprisingly hirsute michael chiklis is able they spend most of the movie being scared of russell and the rest of it running for their lives russell's performance here is one of the best he's ever given with almost no words to say he conveys emotion feeling and meaning with looks and glances it is almost a mime performance when the action sequences kick into gear he kicks ass and does so in a strong silent matter of fact way there are flaws jason scott lee is brutish as a superior genetic soldier jason isaacs does a great impression of frank burns from m a s h as a weaselly commanding officer and gary busey busts a gut and nearly busts his girdle as todd's mentor this is an underrated and excellent sci fi flick and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of blade runner david webb peoples wrote both screenplays
<START> i've been a fan of xu ke hark tsui for many year since school this film is the best fantasy movie in years i dont think action is the right genre though there're lot of action and kongfu scenese wait did i mentioned this is an oriental fantasy moive please keep in mind that do not use hollywood formula to rate this film and for the guy who poo around i don't blame you 'cause you still young and need to know more about culture
<START> this is actually one of my favorite films i would recommend that everyone watches it there is some great acting in it and it shows that not all good films are american
<START> the pakage implies that warren beatty and goldie hawn are pulling off a huge bank robbery but that's not what i got out of it i didn't get anything in the first half there's a new character without introduction in every other scene the first half hour is completely incomprehensible the rest is just one long annoying underlit chase scene there's always an irritating sound in the background whether it's a loud watch ticking a blaring siren a train whistling or even the horrible score by quincy jones there are a lot of parts that are laughably bad too like the bad guys chasing beatty on thin ice with a car or the police arriving at the scene roughly fifteen times i really hated this movie
<START> a very good wartime movie showing the effects of war on a hometown boy who looses his eyesight on guadalcanal and must come home and re adjust himself with the help of family and friends an excellent cast of actor's helps make this movie very entertaining eleanor parker's role as the girlfriend was worthy of an oscar nomination she has such an innocence to her in this movie ann doran role was equally satisfying as was all of her small supporting roles i especially like the hometown aura of pre war phildelphia the hunting scene is very good of course the war scene on guadalcanal truly showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle a well deserving film and one that should not be forgotten
<START> veteran sleazeball bruno mattei is at it again with this erotic thriller that clearly echoes joel schumacher's 8mm but as expected mattei does his movie on a minuscule budget so that it already looks obscure when it's newly released br br after her daughter gets abducted a mother enters the dark world of underground pornography because the kidnappers belong to an international organization that direct snuff films as long as the exclusive clients pay well the search for her daughter does not only lead the mother across europe but also into prostitution she goes to bed with some guys to get her clues when she finally reaches contact with the snuff organization lead by the mysterious doctor hades she's getting into great danger herself br br there is not much good to say about this one even though it starts promising problem is that the movie is by far not as sleazy or explicit as one might expect from the director who made films like blade violent snuff trap which was first released in russia is neither gory enough nor does it contain the amount of nudity and sex to really keep the viewer's attention the plot isn't that special either except maybe for the surprisingly many different locations throughout europe the ending is hugely disappointing the acting isn't really remarkable either except for anita auer who plays doctor hades she looks and acts extremely creepy you don't want to meet her like this in a dark alley or your bedroom for that matter br br all in all snuff trap only appeals to collectors of bruno mattei's films but it's good to see the man back on the helm again it was his first thriller since 1994's giallo gli occhi dentro
<START> this movie is very much like flashdance you know that dance flick with jennifer beals that film is probably the most boring film i have ever seen since it's not even bad enough to be funny g i jane is much better than that film but that doesn't say much here demi moore sweats a lot and there's high music and we get to see her fight and everything but it is certainly not very engaging i really think the idea behind the film is kind of interesting but the script is too clichÃ©d and ridley scott can't do anything about that well like i said it's better than flashdance 4 10
<START> the most difficult thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it the characters were stereotypical white trash the movie's plot was stunted from the beginning and the worst feature of this movie was that the nudity was so blatantly from body doubles it was funny regretfully that was the only funny thing in the movie ms jenkins would be better served if in the future she would refrain from using her life story to entertain people it was simply that bad the one positive aspect of this movie this has nothing to do with the lack of quality of the film is that my brother shelled out the money for this stinker
<START> is it a remake og the thing 1982 1951 i think it is there are so many factors from det previous movies do deny it br br so the acting is bad james spader does a superlow stargate re enactment of himself with his coffy mug and his somwhat strange thinking movements but that's about it the other actors i did't even notise you don't get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters and the plot evolvement is slow boring and yah i know what is about to happend in 30mins score music is ultraboring imean there are alot of ubertallented people out there that would make scores for a coke and a credit but this is major crap some of the special effects are nice if it was made in early 90's if you like slimy aliens chills and thrills don't whatch this movie its a dull combination of the thing alien 3 outbreak and some jerry bruckheimer michael bay production gone really really bad now this combination would be cool if somone knew what they where doing and the only ones on this production that knew that was no one br br though i have seen far worse i would not recomend this movie to anyone but if you are up one cold night and just wanna glanse at something it will pass the time slowly
<START> the write word br br what you see is what you get not really what madhur bhandarkar's brave and brilliant 'page 3' does is destroy the myth attached to the glam and glitterati that colour the pages of our newspapers and whose lives read party habits we follow with such maniacal fervour which only our intrinsic voyeuristic streak can explain br br the page 3 phenomenon is as deplorable as it is enigmatic how exactly did it gain such control over the printed word and when did it start to encroach into the front page is subject for another debate bhandarkar cleverly avoids that he is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence and in doing that he pieces together the various elements of this way of life like robert altman although i'm not comparing bhandarkar to altman's genius bhandarkar uses myriad characters to further his motive whether it is a page 3 wannabe nri the gate crashers the newly rich an upcoming model a socialite politician or an erotic novella authoress all the characters are introduced with an objective and each of them has a separate character sketch even if their parts may be miniscule and therein lays the film's appeal br br konkona sen sharma plays madhavi sharma a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for nation today initially content with her job she soon begins to see the ugliness of this underbelly that is covered by its fake and cosmetic profligacy but bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject into a moral policing movie and avoids concentrating on one character alone hence the movie is not only about madhavi but also equally about deepak suri boman irani madhavi's editor who passively accepts his role as a cog of a larger machinery anjali thapar soni razdan a socialite suffocating from the social pollution abhijeet rehan engineer a homosexual make up artist and madhavi's roommates pearl sandhya mridul the sassy airhostess and gayatri tara sharma an aspiring actress it seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many characters and more in one story but full credit to nina arora and manoj tyagi for penning a tight screenplay the dialogues by sanjeev datta and bhandarkar have been written with great attention to detail br br any narrative no matter how good can fall flat with the lack of genuine performances thankfully 'page 3' brims with actors and not stars konkona goes through her author backed role with effortless ease ditto boman sandhya mridul gets the best written part but almost overdoes it atul kulkarni is wasted though with an underwritten character at times the director seems too keen to incorporate as much as possible paedophilia homosexuality etc but the contexts in which they are used do not make them look rushed br br ultimately bhandarkar's attempt is to satiate our voyeurism but he takes it a step further he takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the gruesome realities of this sect of humanity that strangely seems to be living in a different and remote world these are the same people that indulged in new year's revelry while a few hundred kilometers away their fellow countrymen had been ravaged by nature's ferocity clever writing skillfully incorporated songs able performances and a genuine feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy in spite of its lack of finesse and poor production values 'page 3' is an optimum way to enter a new year of cinema br br abhishek bandekar br br rating br br poor average good very good excellent br br 29th january 2005
<START> expectations were somewhat high for me when i went to see this movie after all i thought steve carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like anchorman the 40 year old virgin and little miss sunshine boy was i wrong br br i'll start with what is right with this movie at certain points steve carell is allowed to be steve carell there are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh and it's due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle room to do his thing he's an undoubtedly talented individual and it's a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be in my opinion a total train wreck br br with that out of the way i'll discuss what went horrifyingly wrong br br the film begins with dan burns a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column he prepares his girls for a family reunion where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other br br the family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie no family behaves like this it's almost as if they've been transported from pleasantville or leave it to beaver they are a caricature of what we think a family is when we're 7 it reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating touch football crossword puzzle competitions family bowling and talent shows are not how actual people behave it's almost sickening br br another big flaw is the woman carell is supposed to be falling for observing her in her first scene with steve carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated what i imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded br br it makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet i left the theater wondering what i just saw after thinking further i don't think it was much
