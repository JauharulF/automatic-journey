<START> trite clichÃ©d dialog and plotting the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies hokey music and a paint by numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans br br what saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of bakshi's work the rotoscoping and the fact that frank frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him this is frazetta in motion the violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword sorcery movie of the period br br i like to watch this with the sound off playing the soundtrack to the first conan movie instead
<START> the proverb never judge a book by it's cover was coined as a warning to those who fail to look beneath the surface br br as i viewed the artwork to king of the ants i instantly thought horror the arcane imagery proudly displayed on the cover back spoke of a dark vision the synopsis promised a story of murder betrayal retribution instead what i discovered beneath that surface was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock br br king of the ants features chris l mckenna as sean crawley an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world even if it means murder except sean crawley is someone you don't care about never once did i feel any compassion or sympathy for this character in fact he's downright unlikable but not as much as daniel baldwin ray mathews who turns in an uninspired performance as a made all the worst by the utterly laughable dialogue he is forced to recite throw in kari wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has unconditional trust esp in the homeless and little to no common sense and george wendt as duke which is basically a sober norm from cheers but mean br br now there are a couple of interesting hallucination sequences in this film the source of the cover images but this film never delves further into that world it prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters bad dialogue and unlikely event after unlikely event oh the horror
<START> i love henry james books and washington square was no exception i was very excited to see a new movie coming out based on the book of that title jennifer jason lee is an exceptional actress and ben chaplin good enough to play the lead roles albert finney is miscast and doesn't carry the role well i wanted to shoot maggie smith or rather her silly insipid role the real problem and what's lacking in this latest version is a good script music and direction br br i fell asleep in the theater watching this long drawn out and exceptionally boring movie there are more pauses in the dialog than a pinter play in the book i felt a deep caring for catherine sloper and her life the movie had just the opposite effect i also disliked the twist where her aunt has a sexual attraction to morris eeeeeeeek yuk br br watch it if you can't sleep it's a definite snoozer don't watch it if you're depressed you'll need zoloft after this br br sure the heiress was exceptional with olivia haviland and montgomery clift in the title roles the actor who played her father was on the mark as the uncaring cold father still grieving for his dead wife and hating catherine for it the movie was not faithful to the book but neither is this one br br this movie was a box office flop i have no doubts as to why
<START> white noise had potential to be one of the most talked about movies since the exorcist i think seeing as evp is supposedly true it really had an easy passage to be a feared true fact not many movies come along that really instill fear into the minds of people like i said this movie could have but did not the movie degraded itself to a low class pg 13 scary movie nothing compared to the ring or the sixth sense by any means someone really needs to just take charge in the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think but it makes us jump scream everything a horror movie should do i'm honestly sick of the pg 13 horror genre because its becoming a genre of its own we need the old days back the blood and gore days the freddy kruger the jason the mike myers days few movies can pull off a think about this mentality being so not scary so why try to pull it off a few good jumps in this movie amount to nothing but one of the stupidest endings in movie history with no resolution at all don't waste your money on this movie
<START> the funny sound that you may hear when you eyeball this execrable version of jules verne's classic journey to the center of the earth is verne spinning in his grave the only thing about this 80 minute opus that has anything to do with journey to the center of the earth is the title otherwise everything else in this lackluster production is new and not worth watching in fact the director has written here at imdb com that he directed only eight minutes of journey to the center of the earth and the studio tacked on part of dollman helmer albert pyun's sequel to his own alien from l a with kathy ireland evidently the producers ran out of money and to satisfy overseas contractual obligations they grafted pyun's sequel onto director rusty lemorande's movie please don't rent or buy this wretched piece of garbage br br unlike director henry levin's period piece journey to the center of the earth 1959 with james mason and pat boone lemorande's journey to the center of the earth takes place in contemporary times in hawaii two fellows a british nanny and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence richard paul carafotes of blind date and his comic book obsessed brother bryan ilan mitchell smith of weird science are going out to explore a cave the heroine crystina nicola cowper of underworld works for a domestic service called 'nannies r us ' being a nanny has been crystina's life long dream but she has made a less of all five of her nanny jobs nevertheless her sympathetic supervisor ms ferry lynda marshall of africa express sends her to hawaii crystina's new client rock star billy foul jeremy crutchley of doomsday who is scheduling one last concert to revive his flagging career has a dog named bernard foul wants crystina to take bernard to a doggie day spa crystina is waiting on the arrival of her taxi when a careless motel attendant accidentally puts the basket that conceals bernard in richard's jeep you see foul has hidden his canine in a basket because motel management strictly prohibits pets on their premises foul has disguised the dog as a human baby anyway crystina catches a cab and tells the driver follow richard br br after she catches up with them to get her dog the cabbie cruises away and abandons her crystina demands that richard drive her back to town but he has other plans unhappily crystina joins the guys and they get lost and then find themselves in the lost city of atlantis a police state ruled by a dictator at the center of the earth the rulers of atlantis repeatedly notify their citizens that life on the surface does not exist our heroes and heroine stumble onto atlantis quite by accident atlantis resembles a disco and everybody looks like they are straight out of a punk rock opera the ruler of atlantis general rykov janet du plessis of operation hit squad is orchestrating a raid on the surface with clones of the first human wanda saknussemm kathy ireland of necessary roughness to visit atlantis predictably general rykov machinations to rule atlantis and overthrow the earth fails and our heroes and heroine save the day br br journey to the center of the earth is an abomination the movie seems to be a comedy despite its superficial satire about dictatorships albert pyun is one of my favorite low budget action directors but he blew it on this lightweight shambles of a science fiction saga
<START> otto preminger directs this light as a feather story bohemian jean seberg and her equally bohemian widower father david niven holiday in the south of france with nutty mylÃ¨ne demongeot things are fine until family friend deborah kerr shows up nivens a degenerate womanizer finds the conquest of kerr too hard to resist that's fine with seberg as long as niven loves her and leaves her as he's done with all the women in his past including demongeot when it appears as though she's becoming second banana in niven's life seberg exact revenge on kerr preminger tells the story in flashbacks from seberg's perspective and cleverly combines black and white with sunnier color scenes the cinematography by georges pÃ©rinal is stunning the film features some of preminger's least heavy handed direction although he rarely allows any close ups which makes it difficult to make out what the actors are really feeling arthur laurents wrote the script and it's full of acidic dialog and funny scenes mostly involving bird brained demongeot seberg acquits herself fairly well but niven is at his least appealing and he shows no chemistry with either seberg or kerr preminger really mis steps with that casting it's a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to charles boyer with geoffrey horne as seberg's would be suitor and martita hunt as his daffy mother juliette grÃ©co playing herself sings the title song in a paris nightclub the great titles are by preminger regular saul bass
<START> i only recently found out that madeleine l'engle's novel had been turned into a tv movie by disney and ordered the dvd the book was a favorite of mine when i was a child and i read it several times br br despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel the murry family is well cast with a likable if too pretty meg at the center and a charles wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating br br the first half hour is promising enough doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene unfortunately as soon as the non human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart alfre woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric mrs whatsit think miriam margolis or joan plowright instead and kate nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive she must have visited faye dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years for some reason they make her mrs which look like glinda from the wizard of oz when she should have resembled a benign wicked witch of the west br br in the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction i understand that this is a tv movie but the cgi looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier mrs whatsits' centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the chewbacca like suit for aunt beast who in the novel is a velvety elegant creature instead of the ungainly big foot like thing shown here i could go on and on nearly every artistic choice is a disaster presumably because there wasn't a large enough budget to do this justice but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement br br this really would have needed the sense of wonder spielberg brought to his early films what a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children's literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting a wrinkle in time and it's sequels for the big screen giving it the scope it deserves
<START> what a disappointment admittedly the best of the prequels but the story is weak the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces poorly realised and tacked together amateurishly there are numerous continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films and the emergence of darth vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years i won't complain about the abysmal dialogue as this is star wars the original three films had style cult feeling and cracking stories and the strange dialogue added charm the prequels were shallow attempts to make more money and this lack of love shows in spades utterly disappointing
<START> this is very dated but that's part of the charm with this 1933 movie you can say the same for most pre code films they're just different and usually in an interesting way br br it was the short running time the great acting of spencer tracy and the beautiful face and sweetness of loretta young's character which kept me watching and enjoying this stagy but intriguing film br br you'd be hard pressed to find a nicer girl than trinna played by the 20 year old young who was already into making her 50th movie she started acting as a small child that and the fact they made movies quickly back in the old days the camera although in soft focus throughout much of the film zoomed in on loretta's face and eyes many times and i was mesmerized by her beauty br br playing a crotchety man with a cynical outlook on life tracy's bill slowly transformed into a loving man thanks to trinna spencer delivered his lines here with such naturalness that you hardly knew he was acting br br although they have small roles supporting actors walter connolly marjorie rambeau arthur hohl and glenda farrell leave lasting impressions long after viewing this 75 minute film i was particularly fascinated with connolly's role as the minister father figure of the camp br br the story is a little far fetched but hey that's the movies this story is about two lonely great depression victims trying to survive in a hooverville type camp and it winds up to be a very touching tale
<START> just below the surface lies what a simply awful movie is what br br as other viewers have justifiably commented the storm sequences are just plain ridiculous chopping already sodden firewood in the pouring rain now that's smart menace foreboding sexual tension for those read dull contrived dull contrived and dull overly contrived br br i want to say thank god for mia sara's shower scene but in retrospect i think the producers of the film having seen the completed mess realised that they had to put something in to make it half way worthwhile at all so it just becomes yet another contrivance do yourself a favour and give this a miss
<START> i didn't know if i would laugh or cry seeing this only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this this is supposed to be a horror movie but there's only filth in this the most cool scene is the car accident with real special effects from the best of hollywood avoid this movie at all costs see this only for studies of how bad can be a movie
<START> the film is about a young man michael who cares for the elderly one day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his clients around the same time he decides to model his killing after the zodiac killer of the 60's he gets in touch with the author of a book about the zodiac killer and they form a friendship michael has a gun aparently the only gun as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors only not portrayed as the same gun and he goes out a killin' original br br this is a great film if you like b movies i thought the idea of the movie was good but the editing and the acting really drowned the plot i thought the 'blood' was just too fake the lighting was horrible in some places and the dialog was just too standard the movie was shot on video which is okay but the editing of the film just made for some weird 'plan 9' scenes not a bad movie for fans of the b movie genre but if you want something with a bit more polish move on to something else
<START> just re saw this movie after thirty seven years i was eleven years old and caught this flick on south beach at the long gone cinema theater on washington avenue in 1969 i thought where it's at was a very good movie now however after almost forty years it's not as good as it was times have changed and this movie is now a tired old re hash of the war between the generations it did however catch a place in time which is just a memory it's really interesting to see the mod fashions the old vegas a slim don rickles chain smoking and a hip opening song the acting was decent the script somewhat out dated but the memories were still fresh where it's at may not be where it's at for you but for me it was still a nice and entertaining trip down memory lane
<START> br br so not being a poet myself i have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary the effortless motion of goldsworthy as he molds natures beauty into his own work is captivating watch him stick reeds together in a web hanging from a tree in a close up for a few minutes while he speaks of his work and then receive the payoff when the camera cuts to the wide shot be amazed by the ease with which he operates and then realize the futility when a slight breeze knocks down the entire web br br the genius of goldsworthy seemingly knows no bounds as his inspiration is nature itself it is in the essential change of nature where his work though complete in its own sphere is made whole
<START> this is a very enjoyable film with excellent actors and actresses evoking a range of emotions it contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy you get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs and it ends very upbeat
<START> mina kumari exhibits more style and grace just moving from standing to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies the director has produced more memorable scenes of touching beauty than it would seem possible the music and dancing is of the highest possible quality you may notice in the first dance scene the director has all sorts of things occurring in the background other girl dancing a drunk falling down stairs much activity but he knew that we would be watching mina dance and i'll bet unless you viewed this many times you didn't notice all in all perfection j q
<START> bill and ted are back only this time an evil dude from the future has sent back an evil bill and ted to destroy them thus destroying 'wyld stallions' and the basis for human society in the future this time bill and ted have to travel through the afterlife 'totally bogus' and save humanity 'excellent' br br with much of the same zany humour and some wonderful new characters like the grim reaper station and robot bill and ted stations creation bogus journey once again entertains and is worth watching for its soundtrack alone br br 7 10 br br a most triumphant sequel br br party on dudes hehe
<START> chinese ghost story iii is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films the film delivers the spell casting special effects that one can expect but fails painfully on all other fronts the actors all play extremely silly caricatures you have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny the plot is predictable and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow towards the end the movie begins to resemble old godzilla films including shabby larger than life special effects and a well yet another ghost with a godzilla head maybe i would have grinned if i was expecting camp br br it is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula they won't be able to do it again the cash cow is now dead as a dodo
<START> booted out of heaven a gang of horny naked female angels with big plastic fangs have taken up residence in a spooky forest where they feed upon any hapless souls who should wander by it's not long before a group of friends on a road trip are falling victim to the bloodthirsty babesÂ an independent low budget horror made in the uk forest of the damned takes an interesting premise and flushes it down the pan with some of the worst acting effects and direction i have seen in a long time br br director johannes roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera Â the scenes in the delapidated house are fairly tense and there are some deftly handled 'shock' moments but for the most part the film is technically amateurish throw in some truly awful performances from horror icons tom savini and shaun hutson and you have one real bad movie on your hands br br some fun may be derived from the film's sheer shoddiness and there is loads of female nudity for the guys to savour but most will find this a chore to sit through
<START> in rosenstrasse margarethe von trotta blends two stories to create a vibrant tapestry of love and courage the film depicts a family drama of estrangement between a mother and her daughter and the story of german women who staged a protest on rosenstrasse to free their jewish husbands from certain extermination in addition to the dramatization of historical events the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the holocaust by a german and the result of the child's experience of losing her mother while ms von trotta shows that the courage of a small number of germans made a difference she does not use it to excuse german society indeed she shows how in the midst of torture and extermination the wealthy artists and intellectuals of german high society went on about their lives and parties oblivious to the suffering br br rosenstrasse opens in new york as a jewish widow ruth weinstein jutta lampe decides to sit shiva a seven day period of mourning that takes place following a funeral in which jewish family members devote full attention to remembering and mourning the deceased when her daughter hannah maria schrader is forbidden to receive phone calls from her fiancÃ© luis fedja van huet a non jew hannah questions why her mother has suddenly decided to follow an orthodox tradition that she previously rejected when ruth coldly rejects her cousin hannah questions her and learns about a woman named lena who took ruth in as a child when the latter's mother was deported and murdered by the nazis and she vows to find lena and discover the secret of her mother's past br br her quest takes her to berlin where she finds lena doris schade now ninety years old and interviews her on the pretext that she is a journalist researching certain aspects of the holocaust with unfailing memory lena tells her story of how as a young 33 year old woman katja reimann she searched for her husband jewish pianist fabian israel fischer martin feifel who disappeared and was presumed to have been imprisoned despite the protection normally given jews in mixed marriages lena in a radiant performance by reimann discovers that her husband and other jews are being held prisoner in a former factory on the rosenstrasse br br standing together in the freezing night german women whose husband are missing congregate outside the building their numbers growing daily until they reach one thousand shouting give us back our husbands lena finds ruth svea lohde a young girl whose mother is in the building she takes care of her protecting her from the gestapo and raising her after her mother is killed lena comes from an aristocratic german family and her brother recently returned from stalingrad is a wehrmacht officer after being refused help from her father to free fabian she enlists the aid of her brother who tells a fellow officer i know what they do to the jews i saw it given his support she is bold enough to bypass channels and go to the top where her beauty and charm prove irresistible for the minister of culture joseph goebbels a known womanizer while this fictional part of the film has been criticized as degrading to the women protesters it is a historical fact that goebbels was very active in making the decisions affecting rosenstrasse br br the director margarethe von trotta an activist feminist and intellectual is no stranger to political drama she directed a film about socialist rosa luxembourg and marianne and julianne a story of the relationship between two sisters one of whom resorts to political violence to accomplish her liberal objectives in rosenstrasse a film she worked on for eight years she had to make compromises adding the present day fictional element in order to have her film produced that it works so well is a tribute to ms von trotta's artistry and the beautiful screenplay by pamela katz whose father was a refugee from leipzig the events at rosenstrasse give the lie to germans who say there was nothing we could do now von trotta has shown the opposite to be true that something could be done to resist the nazis it is tragic that the example did not catch on
