<START> steve biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority governed south africa in much the same way as gandhi tried to resist the british empire's colonialism in india richard attenborough's film cry freedom is not about biko or apartheid as much as it is about donald woods the white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell biko's story the film has a jarring point of view switch after biko dies in prison from tortuous behavior at the hands of south african police woods played by kevin kline must choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to publish books about biko or allow his wife played by penelope wilton to pressure him into forgetting about the books in that case biko dies in vain what begins as a life changing friendship between biko and woods degenerates into a standard by the numbers escape over the border yarn after biko's death oscar nominated denzel washington is good in only his fourth film as biko but something is wrong in a film that tries to depict the struggles of apartheid by focusing more on the trials of a white family for more than half the film attenborough would have served his topic better by focusing on biko's rise to prominence instead of beginning where biko befriended woods perhaps a black actor in a leading role in a 2 1 2 hour film wasn't exactly conducive to big box office but the film was a tremendous box office flop anyway film politics aside the film still entertains and sends a message or two albeit in pg sanitized fashion of 4 stars
<START> good grief while i still maintain that manos the hands of fate is the worst piece of mental torture available hobgoblins came awfully close this this thing insults the audience at every opportunity br br at least films like space mutiny and future war can be enjoyed on mst3k this one was a struggle to get through i was literally writhing on the couch in anguish this thing managed to embarrass me alone br br even if you are a die hard mst3k fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment think twice about seeing this one br br it's that bad
<START> its time to pay tribute to the great charton heston after his recent passing but this film is not the one his other films of a past generation were ben hur the ten commandents omega man and planet of the apes were his better works br br this film made in 1973 attempts to prophesies a future earth in 2022 that is so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by authorities to eat a universally produced food product called soylent green which is manufactured with human flesh this bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assumes india's population which would be about 2 billion by that stage would be then meat eaters without knowing it br br charlton heston's character this supers secret international conspiracy that world powers have concocted to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation by using cannibalism br br unfortunately for the producers of this film the green message they deliver is not the greens party of today's ethos thank god cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous populations in new zealand fiji and borneo up until only 40 years before this film was made but has been long abandoned by human civilization br br another silly prediction in the film is that women become quasi sex slaves turning back the tide of radical feminism which was on the rise in 1972 when this film was made br br the film was stupid then and is as silly now but does contain a very unmemorable last film performance by the late and great edward g robinson but still no a valid reason to revisit the film other than for academic reasons br br this is a dud of a film and i wouldn't even recommend it to baby boomers or charlton heston fans all the other reviews of this film i have read all sound the same referring to a dystopian society in the future of which the centralised theme only seems to involve the usa in which an ecological disaster has occurred br br the only merit in the film is that earth does face overpopulation
<START> i like this film a lot it has a wonderful chemistry between the actors and tells a story that is pretty universal the story of the prodigal son the aspect i like the best however was the way that the bath house was more than just a background for the story as the father told the son the story of his wife's family in the northern deserts of china the element of water and bathing becomes an almost sacred ritual water was so scarce that a simple bath had profound depth and meaning br br overall the film was very effective there were moments however when it verged on too sweet bordering on cloying during the park recital scene but overall i highly recommend this film
<START> sure i've seen bad movies in my life but this one was so bad that i actually became angry in the theater i wanted my money back i wrote to the director asking him to refund my movie ticket of course i didn't receive a refund or even a reply but it's the point that matters on a scale of 1 10 i give this movie a 42 why did the jeep chevy blazer stop running from being hit with a bat why did they hit the jeep chevy blazer with the bat in the first place instead of cracking the bum's skull the plot was thin the movie filled with obvious clichÃ©s and certain parts of it just didn't make any sense
<START> i have seen this movie a while back after ordering it for my friend who is a big dominic monaghan fan the movie itself was very interesting though it had its positive points which for me was the donnie darko kind of wtf factor after the movie had ended br br of course with positive also come negative points to me the young girl in the film was incredibly good and dominic monaghan did a good job as well unfortunately i don't have this opinion about daniel burke who played lonnie this might just be me and i'm not claiming to be a serious critic in the way that i don't find myself skilled enough but he just didn't seem convincing as an actor but perhaps it's even more striking then for although i am not a critic this does get my attention br br to conclude over all i think it's definitely a film worth watching it's interesting confusing and you just should have seen it
<START> simon pegg plays the part of sidney young a young entertainment writer who has begun the beginnings of a career writing for a grassroots magazine that specializes in badmouthing the shallowness and superficiality of the rich and famous he is making a career out of lampooning celebrities although he has a desperate wish to be a celebrity himself the movie is based on the very bizarre career of toby young who also ran a small magazine in britain called the modern review which offered scathing criticism of pretty much everything imaginable until he closed the magazine in a hail of verbal bullets with his co editor and then went on to a spectacularly failed career as a writer for vanity fair which is pretty much the part of his life told in this movie br br he is at first thrilled to go work for a major publication called sharp's magazine in the movie and despite active nerves he is positively beaming on his first day he meets the chief editor clayton harding played by jeff bridges who is hard as nails but who is also exactly the kind of editor he needs to be for a goof off like young to keep his job at the magazine he offers little in the form of immediate acceptance of young but he also has what can only be described as a liberal tolerance of young's off the wall antics and inappropriate behavior br br much of the comedy in the movie is derived from young's misunderstanding of or indifference to the generally accepted code of public behavior and the peculiar etiquette involved in dealing with the rich and famous but sidney's reasons for acting in such a weird way and for giving outwardly offensive interviews is because he believes that he loathes the entire celebrity culture and it would seem he believes in that age old saying Â 'if you can't beat 'em join 'emÂand then beat 'em br br complicating matters are two very different women there is a charming regular girl at the magazine named alison olsen kirsten dunst who at first is appalled by sidney's obvious arrogance and womanizing ways and a stunning model named sophie megan fox who represents the celebrity culture needless to say sidney's endless attack of superficiality and stardom is a superficial lust for sophie the one with the look of a star br br sophie is stunningly beautiful it's true but also comes across as having not a single thought rattling around in her head alison is a regular girl not very interesting or attractive but dunst's performance makes her a real person a relationship with her would have all the reality of a britney spears marriage and yet the movie retains some level of believability because despite how obvious this is we also feel sidney's pain in not pursuing her i felt it anyway br br how to lose friends and alienate people has a pretty interesting premise and is full of honest satisfactory performances and although it turns into a bit of your standard romantic comedy by the third act it has a variety of well developed and interesting characters danny huston for example gives us a great performance as alison's other love interest who pays homage to the big lebowski also starring bridges with his ever present white russian one of my personal favorite drinks buying absolute and kahlua here in china costs the equivalent of about 350 but my kitchen is never without them br br i am looking forward to the day when simon pegg will branch out a little bit because i love his films but i am completely unsure about his range he played a serious character in hot fuzz but only serious in relation to the lunacy surrounding him and ultimately went back to being himself again which he has pretty much been in shaun of the dead run fat boy run and now how to lose friends he's a rising star it will be interesting to see what else he can do
<START> jean jacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question civilization makes us evil this intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument in that sense it repeats a theme common to french films society is real identity is a construction freedom is criminal here the idea is treated literally both main characters find themselves and each other only when breaking rules this discovery may well hold true in france at any rate it's quite romantic
<START> once again like charlie's angels inspector gadget and thunderbirds a tv series is turned into a full length film and gets ruined for all the hundreds of people that watched basically the duke cousins luke johnny knoxville and bo seann william scott in hazzard county spend a lot of time driving very fast in the general lee but they need to get their act together and stop their family farm being destroyed along with almost the whole town by nasty jefferson davis 'boss' hogg razzie nominated burt reynolds to make way for a huge coal mine they get help along the way from their sexy cousin daisy razzie nominated jessica simpson and uncle jesse willie nelson while being chased by equally mean sheriff rosco p coltrane lost's m c gainey and the police also starring joe don baker as governor jim applewhite jack polick as deputy cletus hogg david koechner as cooter davenport michael weston as deputy enos strate and lynda carter as pauline i think the only reason i give the film an extra star is because of a couple of impressive car stunts and of course the gorgeous body of simpson i'll admit her legs aren't quite catherine bach but still but besides that it is pretty boring it was nominated the razzies for worst picture worst director for jay chandrasekhar worst remake or sequel worst screen couple for simpson her daisy dukes and worst screenplay pretty poor
<START> simply put this is a simplistic and one dimensional film the title the rise to evil should tell you that this isn't going to attempt to be anything deep or do much with hitler's character rather from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background we are given a view of hitler that presents his as a cartoony supervillian seemingly ripped right out of a saturday morning tv show the film really wants to make its case that hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that hitler was evil ultimately making him such a one dimensionally evil character is both boring and confusing one must ask how the inept phsycotic character in the film cold ever persuade a nation to follow him or be named time's man of the year this film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the 20th century and try to delve into his mind instead it basically just says hey hitler was evil just thought you might like to know over and over again the great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of the character give me a break
<START> i saw this film it's english title is who's singing over there at the 1980 montreal international film festival it won raves then and disappeared a terrible shame it is brilliant sublime ridiculous sad and extremely funny the script is a work of art it's been 19 years and i've seen only a handful of comedies or any other genre for that matter that can match its originality
<START> scarface has a major cult following even now 22 years after its release br br it has also been widely criticized as being very tacky unrefined over the top and all bloated up these are people who compare scarface to the godfather movies it is true that on the technical front cinematography screenplay direction etc scarface is way behind 'the godfather' br br but it is also true that what scarface has and some other gangster movies lack is the rawness the sheer crude approach of the gangsters the latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished italian or irish gangsters from other gangster classics like 'the godfather' or 'goodfellas' this is one of the major winning points of scarface and i strongly believe that this fact has been written off as tackiness by most critics i have seen the original 1932 scarface and i must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the remake br br al pacino has been criticized to be over the top and loud in this movie but how about considering that that is precisely the way the film makers wanted tony montana's character to be he is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute he is not the calm michael corleone here he is tony montana a very tacky uneducated individual who doesn't really think much and gets angry all the time br br there is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie the soundtrack is all 80s i love some of the songs including 'gina and elvira's theme' 'push it to the limit' and the title track instrumental br br there are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences including the famous chainsaw scene the rebenga hit the first meeting with sosa and tony's visit to his mother's br br about the performances al pacino is brilliant as the angry cuban refugee he has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing tony montana the most in his entire career and it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes one wonders what scarface would be like without pacino i just couldn't imagine anyone else portraying tony montana and in all probabilities the film wouldn't be as effective without him br br steven bauer shines as tony's friend manny br br robert loggia is wonderful as tony's boss lopez so is f murray abraham as omar in a small role br br then there is some eye candy in the form of elvira played by michelle pfeiffer she looks beautiful and is adequate in her role br br the director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax without revealing anything i would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling br br scarface is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out enjoy it for what it is a raw portrayal of the drug lords and their gangland
<START> i don't think a movie like this would be released today it takes it's time to present the depth of the characters and the plot isn't full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat br br but what this film does have an interesting study in how families' deal with grief how when the language for healing and over coming tremendous loss leaves us mute and we rely on raw emotions instead grief without reason and patience is anger even hate and unfortunately the lead character a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting in the film is given more than his fair share of it he eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather wilford brimley who makes it clear to him that it was an accident i got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart but needed to hear those words from his parents and to receive their forgiveness br br what i loved about this film the lack of dialog there was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction facial expressions and the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors something we don't get to do alot of with today's films br br
<START> for the first three seasons sabrina was a gem hidden away on tgif and later early school day afternoon reruns each episode had a maniac zany energy and rapid fire pacing that overcame the occasional awkward joke melissa joan hart exuded a keen talent for physical comedy particularly in her facial expressions her two aunts playing the straight men or as straight as two witches could be had great comic timing and general chemistry with hart salem as a talking cat was free to dabble in whatever mad scheme he was interested in and one could laugh and take it all in stride because he was after all a talking cat sabrina's friends rounded out the social experience at school in which also housed the typical evil cheerleader and totalitarian principal perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to merge pop culture e g bands of the era jerry springer archetypal human condition morality e g the importance of friendship the spirit of christmas and the literal representation of such related metaphors in the magical realm unfortunately like so many other shows throughout the age of television the show hit its peak during the first three years which coincided with sabrina attending high school starting in season four the move to college marked what would become a precipitous decline in the general quality of the show particularly when the writers chose to introduce josh as harvey's rival and concocting thin excuses for aunts hilda and zelda to remain on screen as key players the final season where sabrina works at a pop culture magazine was unequivocally disappointing still in the end sabrina particularly the high school years remains a unique entry as a hybrid situational comedy with magical elements that elevates it above the tiresome fare that is produced in this genre every year
<START> i will start by saying that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone the fact is it wasn't what anyone was expecting especially from guy ritchie what everyone was expecting was cockney geezers and good one liners do ya like dags etc but this is far more mature than his previous works i would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder this film demands all your attention look past the cool and dazzling look of the film try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film br br yes this has its influences from modern classics fight club pulp fiction etc but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none i feel that if everyone watched this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his mockney masterpieces
<START> sentimental and naive but undeniably affecting emotional man helping man plea in this case personified as german and french miners forced to be closed off from each other after the great war thanks to a new border leading to disillusionment on the german side as the french are the bosses but when a fire begins on the french side the common decency of the german men lead to assistance safety and even friendship this was a plea that would fall on deaf ears within the decade as a certain man from pabst's own side would break that piece and turn the great war into merely a prelude but it is obvious to me that pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental humanism as this film radiates with this optimism whereas his more flippant cynical adaptation of the threepenny opera lacked the bite needed to make that work work also furthering his honest belief are the fact that the characters here are not simplistic mouthpieces for positions but real people with real families whose home lives we are privy to as well these are ordinary working class men who just happen to believe in the worth of caring and treating right your fellow man and in this day of individualist opportunism i'll take a little thinning in my plot to get a positive message that represents a point of view that i think we can all aspire to br br note apparently the ending is cut on most prints where the french rebuild the mining gate closing off the men once again this is a brutal turn of events and may have made the film a better overall film but i would have lamented it souring the positives vibes of the final sequence so in short i'm glad it was clipped grade 8 10 b 7 of 11 of 1931
<START> the movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between but the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable br br but krista allen really rocked in the movie her voice was so seducing and sexy the scenes in the bed involving krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do krista really is one of the best in such roles she also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minutes which is the interesting part of the movie br br burt reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star he could have chosen a better script than this ireally think he did for money
<START> yes that's right it is i firmly believe that the n64 and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made it was amazing the first time i saw it with its huge environments and colorful characters and its amazing now the play control is perfect the graphics are beautiful and it has that nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there a must have for any n64 owner and a reason to get an n64 for everyone else
<START> this movie has a great message a impressive cast ellen burstyn samantha mathis jodelle ferland was 4 years old when she made this movie ellen burstyn and jodelle ferland have both been nominated for best actress in a tv drama at the up coming emmy awards in new york peter masterson director has been nominated best director tv drama at the emmy awards also april 1 2001 jodelle ferland 'won' best actress in a tv drama at the young artist awards in studio city ca i can see why they have 3 nominations mermaid is a true story during the cridits they have the real family on the set something you don't see often you can find mermaid at all blockbuster video stores do watch it you'll be glad you did
<START> this is possibly the worst fencing sword fighting movie ever made that is not just because the so called sports fencing is poor but because the plot characters are so weak that they've got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and later supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying i suppose to maintain audience interest what a waste of f murray abraham's talents you're better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like zorro scaramouche anything that has basil rathbone as the villain as a fencer myself i recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film but if it ever happens it's got to have fresher better drawn characters and a plot with more depth
