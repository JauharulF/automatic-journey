<START> tony arzenta a sicilian hit man or professional killer decides to leave the business and his former employers do not agree in terms of content this highly enjoyable action movie doesn't have one in terms of sheer amusement it is funÂit is very melodramatic violent quite brutal the car chases are notable arzenta is an unpretentious yet very likable filmÂmuch better than the current hollywoodian trash that gets the same label it comes from delon's rather short flirting with the italian b cinema of the '70s it carefully uses delon's tough guy persona belonging to the gallery of bad ass thugs that he made in his youth br br i enjoyed very much the fact that delon made this film that he had a role in a good eurocrime flick br br the score is very fine with a good introductory songÂmaking felt that gusto that the italians had for the film considered as a synthetic work where the musical art has an important part br br in tony arzenta big guns no way out the very appealing erika blanc 31 years in '73 appears as an unnamed hooker meanwhile arzenta's girlfriend sandra is played by carla gravina a starlet that practically left the movies after '75 br br arzenta is interestingly filmedÂan ambitious visual conception some expressionistic peculiar angles the movie was directed by the prolific duccio tessari the one who made also zorro the delon comedy needless to mention that these two films tony arzenta 1973 and zorro are very unlike the first one is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie the second is a lighthearted comedy more kindred to a spoof though remarkably coherent and skilfully made duccio tessari directed films like kiss kiss bang bang 1966 sons of satan the bloodstained butterfly Â¡viva la muerte tua tough guys 1974 safari express 1976 etc
<START> warning this review contains a spoiler br br wow almost impressively bad note i said almost this is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story the protagonists you cannot call them heroes shoot innocent bystanders for their food and also rob same for similar reasons there's also tons of homoeroticism which was a turnoff for me spoiler it seems as if the villainess who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim gets killed early on but miraculously recovers adding another 70 minutes of audience torture i can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination if you're in a mst3k mood you might find this watchable but for the most part you can forget it go rent the original conan dvd instead
<START> what a let down this started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters admittedly it moved along at the speed of a snail but i was nevertheless gripped and kept watching br br david morrissey is always good value and he suranne jones were good leads the muslim aspects were very interesting we were tantalised with possible terrorist connections br br but then morrissey's character was killed off and all the air left the balloon the last episode was dull dull dull the whole thing turned out to be very small beer and the dÃ©nouement was unbelievably feeble br br five hours of my life for that my advice watch paint dry instead
<START> it's amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all it is by far the number 1 worst movie i have ever seen br br not only have i ever been this bored before luckily not for more then 1 5 hours the pre adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted after the first very awkward part you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better you hope in vain it only goes downhill from there br br the movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non story three times one can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and trent harris never lays his hands on a camera again
<START> an excellent cast makes this movie work all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and it's clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie br br it's not quite the comedy i expected much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor for music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny br br i hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies but so much of this movie reminded me of alan parker films i can't help it imagine if the commitments actually did make it big and then tried to recapture said glory 25 years later
<START> at the end of the movie i still don't know whether i liked it or not so was the case with most of the reviewers but none the less i still feel that the movie is worth a 7 for the amount of efforts put in br br long ago i read a quote there are 2 kind of writers 1 those who think and write and 2 those write and make the readers think while here i feel that guy ritchie took this way too literally and left all the thinking for the audience br br i felt that the movie was a mixed bag filled with some of the devils advocate and fight club br br it is definitely a classic something which no one understands but appreciates br br what i don't understand why stathom jake green had a blackout thats how it all began all the riddles and mysteries in the movie have been taken care of except this one br br well if you are reading this review to find the solution as what this movie was all about i'll post the very midnight it strikes me and if you are still deciding to watch this movie or not then answer this first when you come across a puzzle labeled as 'no one has ever solved' would you like to try br br i would
<START> i've seen most of ryuhei kitamura's work and i've come to the conclusion that he has a knack for action scenes are kinetic and fast often combining elements of martial arts gun fights and samurai fights with camera work that effectively captures the on screen carnage with versus and aragami kitamura demonstrated that creativity and showed that he his more than capable of working with a low budget so what happened in alive to be more blunt the answer would be nothing nothing happened in alive it was a two hours plus movie with little to no action and little to no characters and plot br br adapted from a comic book by tsutomu takahashi alive is an examination of the life of one tenshu yashiro played by hideo sasaki a death row convict who survives his execution he is then given a choice of either to repeat the execution or to subject himself in a bizarre series of experiments he chooses the latter and soon after that is placed in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infected with a strange parasite that in exchange for it's host's humanity grants supernatural powers naturaly at some point that parasite moves into yashiro the bad thing is that doesn't happen very soon br br similar to aragami alive sets it's first half in establishing the basic exposition characters are introduced their motivations are set and their relations between each other are uncovered the whole thing even takes place in just one set the first major problem of that comparison is that while aragami was just a 70 minute movie alive drags on for more than two hours thus making the first part over one hour long that length could have been justified had the characters been made a bit more interesting but alas that is not the case dialogue is dry monotonous delivered without any sense of emotion or depth characters themselves aren't much interesting there were some small attempts at making alive a bit more moral ambiguous but in the end it all came down to the classic evil government people against super powered protagonist whom yes you guessed it saves the girl in the end like i previously said the entire film practically takes place at just one set and after two hours that does get boring even worse the set design itself wasn't even interesting to begin with and doesn't do much to improve on other aspects of the film br br now after that first part is over one might think that kitamura would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning sadly that is not the case the two only fights are actually rehashes of similar fights from hollywood movies complete with bullet time effects and psychic powers they're just not interesting or fun kitamura's creativity from versus is gone the small set even limits his often very impressive camera work and it all boils down into generic and expectable fights a shame really br br evidently aragami was better on all accounts and kitamura had learned something from alive so it wasn't at least a total loss watching this movie if only to understand the errors made how to fix them and create a better more entertaining movie
<START> what noise fails to do is get us to understand its character tim robbins plays an obsessive new yorker who can't deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer particularly car alarms it's an odd idea for a film which has about as much creative credibility as death wish it is clever at points particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through hagel i'm too stupid to be understanding this he reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion we read it and don't get it either just then a car alarm goes off throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises though all in all it does little to help us understand our hero who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper into his persona br br the film making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems shoddy editing and visible boom mikes no noise isn't all bad william hurt is at least colorful at least the ending doesn't fall flat overall it drives home a logistical point one you haven't probably thought of at least i hadn't though all in all ninety minutes long it couldn't have ended sooner the story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started br br this is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival but probably won't get picked up for distribution check it out on dvd if you're really partial to someone involved in the project otherwise skip it
<START> this movie had a imdb rating of 8 1 so i expected much more from it it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous but before the movie is half way through it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie but we get to know them a little too well they become caricatures not real people at all this is the same story i've seen hundreds of times only told here with slightly different circumstances the thing is i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale br br the only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon
<START> given the history of the director of this movie it is hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through i was at the european premiere last night and one of the executive producers was there he was yet to see the movie and boy was he in for a surprise i have not read the book that this is based upon nor do i know if it highly rated or appreciated but i have read captain correlli's mandolin and given how poorly that was adapted for screen and how bad this movie was i can only presume that something similar has happened here the acting wasn't bad albeit that there were a couple too many raised eyebrows from farrell honestly i can't believed how little i cared for any character in this movie situations play out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness donald sutherland's part comprises a few scenes where he opens a door says something and closes it again i kept looking at my watch when i wasn't cringing at the dialogue on the screen i have never walked out on a movie but i was tempted to start during this i gave this movie a score of '2' for reasons which seem horrendously shallow to me but these are the best things that i can say about this movie the first is that i really enjoyed the all too short earthquake scene and the second is that salma hayek got naked and looked beautiful i can say little else positive about this movie don't ask the dust anything it can't talk
<START> i saw this film at the chicago reeling film festival to pick up on the previous reviewer's remarks the claustrophobic feel and off colors of the film is i sense quite intentional and conveys the sense of limited space drab architecture overall drabness that constitutes the urban environment of most people in eastern and central europe a bit shabby housing project style is how i'd describe it and this is how many people live on the outskirts of larger cities i can't say that i'm familiar with bucharest romania where the action unfolded but i have visited and lived in eastern europe for six months br br when i visited russia as a student for a semester my entire group had to drag their luggage seven stories up the staircase of a shabby student dorm building just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman because the elevators weren't working but i do concur with the reviewer that the claustrophobia and muted colors it's overdone for there are to be sure beautiful historic buildings parks squares you can find in bucharest or in any historic city center of eastern europe and bucharest's didn't get much of any footage in this film for me watching this film conveys well the claustrophobia that i would feel during my half year stay there feeling trapped and limited it makes you see why someone would want to immigrate and find a better life just as people if hope to escape from a united states urban ghetto br br also given the climate of homophobia say circa us in the 1980s the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter hence the focus on their interaction in the apartment br br it's remarkable and commendable in my view that this queer themed film was even made in romania and i find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite uninformed and patronizing it's unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources the actors were fairly good and believable the dialog was overall well done and i could identity with these women br br the film offers an added twist to that of forbidden love between two young women kiki an energetic fun loving free spirit with a dark troubling secret her admiration and love for an abusive incestuous brother sandu falls in love with alexandra a bright bookish idealistic young woman who moves to bucharest to begin her college studies opposites attract and their personalities seem to complement one another though there is some tension between the ambitious studious intellectual alexandra and kiki who seems to be attending college to please her parents keeping their love hidden from their parents seems manageable though we don't get any sense of the tension it requires nor do we ever see or meet any other students hard to believe and the tension keeping their love secret would have entailed the chief threat to their love is kiki's brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him but kiki's love for alexandra seems to give her the strength she needs to finally severe this bond or does it that's what the suspense of the film focuses on as the narrative develops and i won't say how it concludes br br ironically kiki's love sickness isn't love for another woman but her illicit incestuous love for her brother thus loving a woman offers the potential cure to the sickness of loving a sibling br br though this feel of this film is stifling and claustrophobic overly confined to interactions between kiki and alexandra it was still engaging and moving to watch so i'll give it a 7
<START> you can't imagine how i looked forward to king of the ants as a massive gordon fan i awaited the european premiere with wicked anticipation especially since i loved dagon gordon's last achievement so much king of the ants premiered here in my country and it was gordon himself who came to present it unfortunately i couldn't go and congratulate him for it afterwards king of the ants is his most uninspired and mediocre film to date really the quality level never surpassed ordinary tv thriller standards the plot outline is terribly routine and with the exception of a few poor scenes the typical gordon touch is never recognized on top of that the already weak script has more holes than a swiss bowl of cheese it involves a young wannabe crook who's hired to commit a murder so he does and of course they're not paying him and of course he falls in love with the victim's wife and of course he avenges himself only the sequences in which the guy descents in a spiral of madness are worth a mention and they're the only ones reminding you of the fact you're still watching a stuart gordon film the acting performances are below average with mccenna as the heroic lowlife george norm peterson' wendt as the chubby bastard and kari wuhrer as the good hearted sex bomb extremely illogical things happen constantly and the dullness of the story becomes irritating very quickly while the make up effects aren't enough to even satisfy amateur horror fans i read a few other comments on king of the ants claiming it's gordon's best since it finally is a thought provoking and mature film well if that's the case i rather stay immature and give re animator another viewing thank you very much oh well i guess every good director runs out of steam and inspiration eventually too bad it also overcame stuart gordon
<START> so we get so see added footage of brando interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff susannah york was hardly a slouch new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn't notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that let's listen to donner make fun of lester's version that made more logical sense the president talks of the zod defacing the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd superman's freedom of the press line sounded silly compared to care to step outside which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clark's earlier scene in the truck stop then there is the ending with the turn back the world to go back in time effect it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack n j ever went since it doesn't free zod and company any more
<START> i can still remember first seeing this on tv i couldn't believe tvnz let it on i had to own it a lot of the humor will be lost on non nz'ers but give it a go br br since finishing the back of the y series matt and chris have gone on to bigger and better things nz's greatest dare devil stuntman randy campbell has often appeared on the british tv series balls of steel yes he still f ks up all his stunts because he is too drunk br br also the 'house band' deja voodoo have since released 2 albums brown sabbath and back in brown the band consists of members of the back of the y team and singles such as 'i would give you one of my beers but i've only got 6 ' and 'you weren't even born in the 80's' continue their humor br br the south by southwest film festival also featured their feature length film 'the devil made me do it' which will be released early 2008 in nz br br all up if you don't find these guys funny then you can just f k off
<START> ok this has got 2 be one of the worst excuses 4 a movie that i have ever had the misfortune of watching like all other olsen twins movies with the possible exception of new york minute this film had no story gaping plot holes disgustingly putrid acting and bad filming even in case you haven't guessed yet i hate mary kate and ashley the only reason i watched this was because i was really bored and nothing else was on i wonder if the twins will ever stop making the same stereotypical movies where they have an unbelievably stupid adventure in an exotic location and save the day meanwhile getting the help of two cute guys who drool over them immediately the least they could would be to have a guy 4 1 of them or have them both falling 4 the same guy the plot in this story was so imbecilic and just plain dumb even a toddler could see the flaws in it maybe they should split up and start making films individually or maybe films with a different kind of story anyone who liked this movie was no offense either really stupid really artificial or has not seen any really good movie or maybe they are really smart and just have bad cinematic choices either way i would not recommend this movie to my worst nemesis for a good movie experience the only thing it is good 4 is some rib splitting laughter at the pathetic attempts to be cool if you watch for laughs it's hilarious basically i give it 0 or less
<START> when our local tv station first launched it filled a lot of its schedule with old british programming lock up your daughters was duly aired and i swayed by the opening few seconds of the film popped in a blank tape best thing i ever did br br the actors are beautifully suited to their characters and bring them to delightful life complete with appropriate accents christopher plummer's foppington will leave you in stitches as will hoyden and her family double entendres abound plot line wheels within wheels mix and match the characters hilarious sight gags lurk in every scene and risquÃ© comments are made on a regular basis br br i showed the film to friends a few years ago and they called the piece a lost treasure as much for the cast as for the story to this day i can crack up just thinking about the dialog should this gem ever find its way to a dvd release i'll be at the front of the line
<START> it is often only after years pass that we can look back and see those stars who are truly stars as that french film critic whose name escapes me said there is no garbo there is no dietrich there is only louise brooks and there is thank heavens louise brooks this is the third of her european masterpieces but it is also an exceptional film for being one if not the first french talkie for following a script written by famed renÃ© clair for reportedly being finished the direction that is by georg pabst and for incorporating the voice of edith piaf before she was well known so much talent working on and in a film how couldn't it turn out to be a masterpiece and that's what this film is it's a shame louise brooks was blackballed by hollywood when she came back to the states so much talent cast so arrogantly by the wayside in the film in addition to getting to watch louise brooks in action it's great to see pictures of paris ca 1930 and to hear piaf's young voice i never get tired of this film
<START> ernst marischka one of the most respected austrian directors of that time made films full of beautiful scenes delicate love and with respect to all that is precious in life br br nowadays if people should hear about him they associate the name of marischka with sissi trilogy 1955 1956 1957 however he made other excellent films like das dreimaderlhaus 1958 embezzled heaven 1958 and definitely this one madchenjahre einer konigin showing the young years of queen victoria although it deals with a slightly different theme than sissi films i do not see many differences between this movie and sissi they are strikingly similar br br the movie is almost identical the style the music the photography in fact the crew are almost the same anton profes bruno mondi br br the cast romy schneider's one of the first main roles it was a lovely introduction to her role of sissi since this film was made one year before the first part of the trilogy about the austrian empress it is also a film where romy plays with her mother magda schneider but ernst marischka was not the first director who cast romy to play with her mum romy's debut wenn der weisse flieder wieder bluhn 1953 was her performance with her mother too therefore there were some voices that romy began her austrian career on the bases of her mother's fame indeed there is some truth in it br br again like in sissi this film shows love very gently victoria meets prince albert in a little inn in dover their sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smiles and now what would it be showed like only sex but is it the only thing love is based on br br i am grateful to ernst marischka for these movies they had a soul and a message some people may call them kitschy but i will never give up admiring these films they are impressive unfortunately highly underrated
<START> how could 4 out of 16 prior voters give this movie a 10 how could more than half the prior voters give it a 7 or higher who is voting here i can only assume it is primarily kids very young kids the fact is that this is a bad movie in every way the story is stupid the acting is hard to even think of as acting the characters are characterless and the dialogue is terrible i saw this one rainy afternoon on the sci fi channel in the sad event that it is ever rebroadcast i suggest you read a book instead
<START> possibly the best movie ever created in the history of jeffrey combs career and one that should be looked upon by all talent in hollywood for his versatility charisma and uniqueness he brings through his characters and his knowledge of acting
