<START> you know i can take the blood and the sex but that thong bikini shot pretty much did me in someone get that girl some pasta before it's too late br br and you know it's just not a good idea for a schlock movie to start off by mentioning the much better movie it's ripping off br br i gave this one a 2 just because it's marginally better than tobe hooper's crocodile
<START> what a gem of a movie so good that they made a sequel br br the film starts off really good with a nasty monster who eats a few people and a party where the 2 main characters first set eyes on each other br br bendan hughes plays the eccentric vlad a bit of an inkling there to who this character is who has moved into town and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a house br br hell we've all seen vampire movies we know the format br br the movie is watchable but the actors' performances are very wooden and they seem as they don't want to be in this film but may be that's just all part of the decadent ambiance br br didn't like the ending but there is a sequel must track it down br br when i watched the film i thought brendan hughes didn't really fit the part later on i couldn't stop thinking about him he sort of exudes an eerie sensuality so maybe he was right for the part br br brendan hughes last seen in 'hitler the rise of evil' as lt guffman br br where is he now
<START> what another reviewer called lack of character development i call understatement the movie didn't bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory yes there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of but this was primarily a one day snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters' lives henry thomas's performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action good rental
<START> first i bought it at the video store second i watched it third it was boring fourth it was not funny fifth most of the antics were lame and last but not least it's not only a bad movie it's a total fiasco br br i am a huge adam sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film i pity it because it was his first movie even if you are a huge adam sandler fan don't bother watching this movie instead just take the video board a yacht and throw it overboard
<START> i remember watching this is its original airing in 1962 as a five or six year old and really enjoying this i recently had the opportunity to watch it again for the first time since then as it was aired on walt disney presents on the disney channel i'd forgotten most of it and some of it was geared towards kids but it was still enjoyable i can't wait to show it to my niece and nephews
<START> serum starts out with credits that are quite reminiscent of the re animator movies and it owes a lot to them the story is very similar a mad doctor develops a serum that he believes will alleviate pain sickness and death but he's apparently not a big believer in clinical trials and so winds up with a brain eating zombie on his hands in the person of his nephew the zombie even looks like one of those from re animator and in fact some of the make up effects in serum aren't bad unfortunately the script is pretty slow and unbelievable in quite a few places resulting in a soap opera feel for most of the first 3 4 of the movie for some reason the director feels compelled to tell us the time of day every few minutes by flashing it in big white letters across the screen i can't see why this was important other than being an attempt to provide viewers with a sense of time passing sometimes that wouldn't be present otherwise as the plot plods along br br there are a number of moments that just don't add up here for instance one victim is bludgeoned with a sledge hammer but when we see the victim's head up close there's no sign of that trauma in another scene a character runs down a fully lit hospital corridor we can see the circles of light on the floor in fact with a flashlight in hand looking for all the world like he's walking in the dark but a moment later a second character walks down the same fully lit corridor without one these are just a couple of examples moments of what look like directorial or editorial sloppiness crop up quite frequently throughout the movie br br serum is better in some ways than much of what goes straight to video as independent horror lately in terms of technical items Â sound and photography for example Â it's got a more polished look than a lot of what lands on a dvd on the other hand there's still a good deal of wooden acting particularly by one of the lead characters the mad scientist himself and nonsensical moments that have nothing to do with suspension of disbelief and everything to do with writing and continuity maybe these are things that the people involved with making this film will eventually get more experience with though one of the problems with low budget independent horror lately is that the filmmakers often set out to remake more popular movies that had bigger budgets and that almost never works out it didn't in the case of serum anyhow
<START> there are many kinds of reunion shows one kind is where old actors are taken out of mothballs and set to recreate characters they haven't played for twenty or thirty years these have mixed results return to mayberry' despite some silliness was okay return to green acres' as execrable eddie albert used a word for the script i won't repeat here but both it and the movie stink rescue from gilligan's island' filled in a necessary gap in the story of the castaways though the show itself was silly even from a gilligan's island' viewpoint in most cases the scripts are weak sometimes a silliness appears in the scripts that is too knowing Â and in comedy it's nearly always fatal for the characters to know they're being funny new characters are introduced who don't fit the mix in the main these reunion shows are pretty weak a second sort of reunion' show is the kind where the cast lays its past aside but sits around telling stories reminiscing interspersed with flashbacks from the shows then there are movies based on the shows which are rarely good and movies based on the history of the show the brady bunch' has had both of these happen to it with various results br br return to the batcave' uses nearly all the above with a wonderfully twisted viewpoint which makes it the best of the reunion shows and has raised the bar for the others br br adam west and burt ward and summoned to a showing of the original batmobile while they are there the car is stolen br br the adam west of the movie is a man demented he called jerry his butler alfred' he opens a bust of shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to slide down to the parking garage he's obsessed with being a crime fighter when in fact he's merely a washed up actor when the batmobile is stolen he not only believes it's his duty as a crime fighter to recover it he drags and unwilling burt ward in as his assistant br br the pursuit is largely loquacious with west and ward reminiscing about the old days it is broken by flashbacks' with actors playing west and ward in the old days the modern scenes and the flashbacks' both have the wacky lack of reality the show maintained there are also running gags that show west is able to make fun of himself in ward's book about his time on the show he spoke frankly about west's libido and also his being a skinflint west makes ward pay for everything in their pursuit down to tips and bus fare the clues they follow the characters they meet even in flashback all fit the mentality of the old series and there are several homages including a fist fight with written sound effects br br the whole thing is extremely funny and done with great panache there are also cameos by julie newmar looking like she's had one facelift too many and frank gorshin reminding us why he has such a cult following gorshin will be the riddler when jim carey his obvious successor is long forgotten the movie builds to a fairly obvious but funny climax br br this show is a model for reunion shows Â unfortunately there are few that can fit the pattern this show had actors replaying their old characters young actors playing a movie about the making of the show the actors west and ward reminiscing and a modern day movie with the real adam west playing the demented adam west it has everything if you loved the old show this is the stopper on the bottle
<START> i think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial africa in the 50's and 60's rather than as a story because there is no real story here just one vignette on top of another like little points of light that don't mean much until you have enough to paint a picture the first time i saw chocolat i didn't really get it until having thought about it for a few days then i realized there were lots of things to get including the end of colonialism which was but around the corner just no plot anyway it's one of my all time favorite movies the scene at the airport with the brief shower and beautiful music was sheer poetry if you like exciting movies don't watch this you'll be bored to tears but for some of you you can thank me later for recommending it to you
<START> normally i don't like series at all they're all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast br br these series however are well played the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one the story will still be catching your mind br br the episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital
<START> in lizzie borden's love crimes 1992 sean young plays a gritty d a in atlanta she's a loner who gets herself too deeply involved in the case of a man patrick bergin who poses as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women takes compromising photos of them then leaves them br br naturally this tough loner decides to enter the phony shutterbug's life by posing as his prey intending to bring him to justice they meet they make love then the next thing she knows she is over his lap getting spanked note the spanking scene is only in the unrated version of this film the r rated version omits it and several other scenes that would make the plot more lucid this psychological thriller includes several scenes of female nudity and disturbing images such as bergin chasing one of his victims around the room flailing at her with a riding crop br br as a thriller love crimes is at its best when sean young is playing her cat and mouse game with bergin trying to catch him in an incriminating act it's unfortunate that the film doesn't end it just stops that's true director lizzie borden may have just run out of story to tell but after 92 minutes the credits roll and we are left with a puzzling what just happened bewilderment br br the unfolding of young's plan is played out in engaging style but the lack of a coherent ending will be a turn off for some viewers br br dan daneldorado yahoo com
<START> scarecrows is one of those films that with a little more acting a little more direction and a lot more story logic would have been quite compelling as a horror entry as it stands it is still a creepy film that has solid make up and gore effects and a premise that sustains the mood of terror in spite of itself and hey there are no teenagers getting killed one by one just dumb adults so that is a refreshing change of pace and the plot line is amazingly similar to dead birds with a precipitating robbery an abandoned spooky house in the middle of nowhere and demonic monsters but just like dead birds the adults are still witless they run around cluelessly before getting slaughtered one by one and they ignore the obvious danger br br in scarecrows though we never really find out the supernatural why and that sustains the atmosphere of creepiness and like clowns scarecrows can be very creepy unless they look like ray bolger of course escaping in a hijacked plane with the pilot and his daughter after a robbery netting millions a para military bunch is double crossed by one of their own a very nervous guy named burt he jumps out of the plane with the big and heavy box that holds the money with apparently no plans as to how to move it around once he is on the ground being the dumbest of the bunch he is murdered first but not before he happens upon the fowler residence nestled snuggly amid lots of really creepy looking scarecrows and surrounded with a wooden fence encircled with barbed wire and lots of warnings to stay away and the weird weathervane on the roof with the pitchfork and pterodactyl should have been a warning sign too the inside of the house is also quite foreboding to us in the audience anyway br br annoyingly we must listen to burt's thoughts in voice over as he walks around and mysteriously comes across the key to the decrepit truck in the yard the way the key pops up would be enough to have my pants with me in them flying out the door perhaps it's just me but i really enjoy watching people's lips move on screen even when they are just thinking out loud it helps to intensify the action and gives the actor more to do than just look like what the voice over is saying burt hoists the box onto the truck and makes his getaway sure why not decrepit trucks always have lots of gas in them especially with today's prices and the battery no problem now i did mention that burt was the dumbest of the bunch and here is why in addition to the above of course wearing night vision goggles to walk through the foliage and find the house he takes them off to drive the truck away and instead turns on the headlights to see where he is going of course the crooks still in the plane spot the headlights of his truck and know where he is headed brilliant he deserves to die definitely i am not sure why he needed night vision goggles in the first place as every scene is brightly lit from the interior of the plane to the night time outside scenery and the house the cinematographer was either a myopic b just out of school or c dealing with really cheap filmstock br br burt meets his demise when the truck dies in the middle of nowhere go figure one very nice touch and there are i must admit a few in the film is the fact that when he opens the truck's lid there is no engine creepy to be sure and insert pants comment again here the story logic fails when dead now stuffed like a flounder with money and straw burt returns to the house the rest of the bunch are there rough him up then realize that he is indeed dead and was gutted and stuffed like a flounder with money and straw dead burt does manage to put up quite a fight though and grabs one fellow by the mouth pushing him through a window causing him to bite off more than he could chew in a gorylicious scene at this point you would think they'd would be racing out of the house and back to the plane but noooo they decide to stay and look for the rest of the money in fact the whole burt is dead episode is treated rather matter of factly although one bright bulb in the bunch does argue burt was walking around dead for chrissakes br br the stolen money suddenly appears on the grounds outside the house and the crooks blithely go for the bait soon another one of them jack is dispatched and again the scene is well done and horrific involving a dull handsaw and no anethesia now there are three scarecrows going about wreaking mayhem and one of them needs a hand literally br br when one of the crooks sees the scarecrows and jack getting scarecrow ized he starts screaming running away like hell and shooting off his gun in typical para military fashion so much for all that training under pressure crap he meets up with the others and stops in his tracks to explain why he is screaming running away like hell and shooting off his gun even though the scarecrows appear to be chasing him again that script logic thing dead and gutted jack returns to the house and goes after the screamer with the usual results if you listen to jack's demonic growl by the way you may notice depending on your age that it is the same monster growling sound heard often in the lost in space tv episodes br br the last two survivors race away from the house and back to the plane barely escaping but do they you will have to see the film to find out
<START> when i was 16 i saw the documentary a funny thing happened on the way to the moon i actually liked and believed in it for a couple of years but then i grew up and began to think and when i had sought more information this is more info from reel sources and non biased sources when i started at university not so long ago i asked an assistant professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories what he said shocked me he said that all those theories where lies that baffled me i did not believe it first but then he presented evidence for his claims he quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject humans did not go to the moon the most outrages claim was that the apollo craft could not travel through the van allen radiation belt without the crew perishing from radiation the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum anti radiation alloy it is not that well known and the exact specifications are a secret and why is it a secret well why should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russians then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation br br and then there is the biggest evidence of all the moon stones when the apollo missions did go to the moon they brought back many rocks from the moon to give to geologists and similar scientists who are documenting all things about the moon these rocks and stones are in fact from the moon because the internal basic elements which all matter consist of are also made of special isotopes that are different from quarry to quarry land to land and especially planet from planet the isotopes of these rocks and stones have been proved that they do not come from earth the astronauts brought home hundreds of kilogram's of these rocks all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth and from the same planet ergo the moon landings where not fake nasa did go to another planet the moon though it is not a planet but a satellite to a planet a moon duuh these rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world it has been proved humans did go to the moon it is a fact pronto br br but i do not worry most conspiracy theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts the fact remains humans did walk on the moon
<START> i'd passed this title 15 or 20 times while in blockbuster looking for something halfway decent to watch all i can say is that they were all out halfway decent films the night i chose to rent this br br i will give it credit for being leaps and bounds better than dracula 3000 but in actuality that's pretty easy to say since this one didn't have caper van dien in it the other things it lacked in spades were an interesting cast interesting story good dialog and originality but i suppose you can't have everything br br spoilers ahead the misfit crew of vampire hunters one of which was a vampire go figure flew around from mining colony to mining colony trying to wipe out all the vampires it could find the crew consists of the cocky ne'er do well captain who dies early on his by the book yet inexperienced first mate the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter not a typo a wannabe cowboy and a really really butch asian commando tough guy female it almost sounds like the cast for mtv's 'the real world' after the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a mob of bloodsuckers and as it turns out lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy his first mate takes over blah blah blah everyone hates him blah blah blah i could go on but as i said it's the same storyline used in about a hundred other 'films' of the genre br br the effects were cheese and why michael ironside was in this movie is beyond me the vampire vampire hunter still not a typo was pretty hot but of course if you're waiting for her to expose more than just her cleavage look elsewhere br br i can't say that it was the worst film i've seen as i actually rented 'starship troopers 2' but wait for this one to come on the sci fi channel
<START> i don't think that many films especially comedies have added memorable quotable dialog like moonstruck i won't illustrate it you can see a remarkably long list of quotes on this thread but any film that can make subjects like the defense of using expensive copper piping rather than brass for plumbing purposes into memorable dialog is amazing to me it is not the only line that pops up and makes an imprint on our memory how about a restaurant waiter who regrets a planned marriage proposal because it will mean the loss of an old bachelor client or a nice elderly dog fancier encouraging his pack to howl at he moon or perry john mahoney's description of a female student's youthful promise as moonlight in a martini my favorite line br br moonstruck is a wonderful example of brilliant script first rate direction and a good ensemble cast that fits perfectly there are other examples the drama the ox bow incident is another example but a grimmer one cher olympia dukakis vincent gardenia nicholas cage john mahoney and danny aiello are all involved in plots and cross purposes that examine the nature of love and how to handle it is it a good thing to be totally in love cher and cage at the end seem to think so but dukakis knows that real love drives the individual crazy and cage gets a glimmer of realization of this too when he and cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera la boheme is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death dukakis believes so and oddly enough although he is not totally convinced aiello chance reveals infidelity dukakis realizes early that gardenia's odd behavior is tied to unfaithfulness and cher literally stumbles onto gardenia and his girlfriend at the opera but gardenia also stumbles onto cher's similar unfaithfulness to aiello but chance also causes misunderstandings fyodor chaliapin stumbles on dukakis walking with john mahoney and thinks that she is having an affair br br there are lovely little moments in the film too cher's observation about flowers leading to receiving one her hearing the argument in the liquor shop and it's resolution but best is the sequence of louis guss and julie bovasso as cher's uncle and aunt raymond and rita cappomaggi and rita's charming and kind comment to raymond about the effect of the moonlight on him it is the sweetest moment of the entire film br br it is close to a flawless film after seeing it over a dozen times in as many years i can only find two points that do not seem as smooth as they should be when cher is at cage's bakery his assistant chrissy nada despotovich mentions how she is secretly in love with cage but has been afraid to tell him earlier she was slightly snippy towards cher who put her in her place quickly yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry at the same time the fact that cher forgets to deposit her uncle and aunt's daily business profits is brought in momentarily in the concluding seven minutes of the film but just as quickly dropped was there supposed to be some plot lines that were dropped besides one about cher and vincent gardenia working at a homeless man's shelter as penance it is a small annoyance but i think it is just based on a desire to see more of this film because it is so very good
<START> admittedly i watched this piece with already very low expectations dieter bohlen is a rather untalented composer parvenu whose lack of talent is only surpassed by the size of his ego br br this was the first cartoon movie that i watched that was 100 per cent humor free it is rude offensive redneck and blatantly anti women as such it is a creation befitting bohlen but the average viewer will be rather put off by it no wonder that it was never shown in a cinema theater it would've bombed big time br br not even the expense of 6 5 megaeuros were able to save this utter piece of crap save your time and money
<START> effort aside this isn't a review about good intentions its about the final product this film is poorly written overacted and poorly directed the story obviously had potential but that story is nowhere present in this film br br clara barton was a human being she had passions desires love pain embarrassment weakness and self doubt just like the rest of us you would never know that from this film of the lead actress's performance in fact apply that to every character in the film but in barton's case every sentence is a speech an epic over the top speech as though from an inhuman robot in fact the only scene that plays well in one in the board meeting and i realized thats because she's making a speech every idea she has is unbelievable in its context and she comes up with ideas that sound like they take a lifetime of soul searching right on the spot for example when she sees a wounded man she'll start pontificating about the needs of the battlefield and to protect soldiers and putting up white flags etc as played in the film there's no way she could come up with such a detailed well thought out idea in seconds br br in conclusion this film robs clara barton of her struggles it robs her of her humanity and it inherently cheapens all she did because the script is written in clichÃ©s the writer doesn't know clara barton and seems to have based his script on an encyclopedia britannica article yes they had those back then but hey nice technicolor who cares
<START> this movie could had been an interesting character study and could had given some insight on its subject but real problem with this movie is that it doesn't have any of this in it it doesn't give any insight or solutions to the problem it's just the portrayal of 'old' male sex addict and the problems this is creating for his every day normal life and family why would you want to watch this it's all so totally pointless and meaningless br br it also really doesn't help that the main character is some wrinkly 50 year old male you'll have a hard time identifying yourself and sympathize for him he just seems like a dirty old playboy who is an a constant hunt for woman and sex he has all kinds of sexual intercourse's about 3 times a day with different woman and not just only with prostitutes br br it also doesn't have a bad visual style though it all feels a bit forced but nevertheless it's all better looking than most other direct to video productions who knows if the film makers had been given better material to work with the movie would had deserved a better faith br br the story really gets ridicules at times there are really some pointless plot lines that are often more laughable than they were obviously supposed to be i'm talking about for instance the whole ordell plot line things get worse once they movie starts heading toward the ending also the whole way the story is being told cutting back and forth between the events that happened and the main character's sessions with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap and simple br br but as far as bad movies are concerned this just isn't one of them it's not really any better or worse than any other random straight to video flick with similar concepts br br still seems weird and quite amazing that they managed to cast nastassja kinski and ed begley jr in such a simple small insignificant production as this one is guess they were really desperate for work and money br br 4 10
<START> i wasn't particularly impressed by this movie that has lackluster music and only lasts 40 minutes thank god because i was falling asleep i makes excellent use of time lapse photography to display the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow people water clouds etc unfortunately that's all it is br br my preference is for its predecessor the excellent koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 at 87 minutes and to prove that a sequel can be better than the original powaqqatsi made in 1988 running 90 minutes br br try them both
<START> the key to the 40 year old virgin is not merely that andy stitzer is a 40 year old virgin but rather the manner in which steve carell presents him as one in a genre of crass comedy that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters the 40 year old virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent heartfelt script that doesn't use its protagonist as the butt end of cruel jokes that andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke in fact as it is a curiosity br br carell a veteran of team ferrell in anchorman and an ex daily show castmember uses the concept of the film to expand his character Â we get to understand why andy is the way he is it's the little things that make this film work when andy's co worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend andy describes his failed efforts at cooking when andy rides his bike to work he signals his turns he doesn't just adorn his home with action figures Â he paints them and talks to them and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood a lesser comedy wouldn't even begin to focus on all of these things br br the plot is fairly simplistic Â andy's co worker pals find out he's never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman it's a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenility br br andy's friends are a complement to his neurotic nature david paul rudd has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her jay romany malco is a womanizing ladies' man and cal seth rogen is a tattooed sexaholic their attempts at getting andy in the sack backfire numerous times and each time leaves andy feeling less and less optimistic br br finally andy meets single mom trish played by catherine keener and much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers aren't worth it he falls in love with her they begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days Â trish being unaware that andy is still a virgin br br the 40 year old virgin was directed by judd apatow the man who produced anchorman and the cable guy and began the short lived cult tv show freaks and geeks apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor and the script Â co written by carell Â offers plenty br br however in the end the most interesting and indeed surprising aspect of the 40 year old virgin is its maturity by now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics and even i was surprised by its warm reception but after seeing the film it's easy to understand why we like andy we care about him he's not just some cardboard cutout sex comedy clichÃ© Â he's a real living breathing person his neurotic traits combine the best of woody allen with childish naivety his friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet it strikes a chord with the audience br br although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor it doesn't offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on screen the best sex comedies work this way Â from risky business to american pie Â and that is the major difference between something like the 40 year old virgin and 40 days and 40 nights
<START> i liked this a lot in fact if i see it again and i plan to i just may love it i'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does grow on you as you watch it starts kind of slowly but the way in enfolds is very natural and has a mood to it you just get into it br br i really liked the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole the characters have a strong element of realism and the movie very slowly and gently weaves a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take br br i am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on this there are obscure tv movies that have more comments then rich in love br br one thing that i will say is i missed the ending which is driving me crazy and i have to watch it again to see that this is a movie that may not be for everybody but that i feel is strongly underrated even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is haven't seen this and it doesn't even seem to have much of a message board but i liked it a lot and to all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery atmosphere and an unhurried languid pace should probably take a look at this especially note worthy is that it takes place in south carolina so for those like me who love the south and movies that take place there this is a gem i'll add my vote to the woefully few comments and recommend this little known flick
