<START> first of all this movie isn't a complete disaster if you had never heard of the real story of gram parsons then it might seem a reasonably entertaining diversion johnny knoxville can't really be criticised for his performance as phil kaufman he's pretty good at looking laid back and down to earth and you can sort of root for his long suffering everyman michael shannon is due credit for pretty much the same reasons except he's a hippy stoner there are some good individual comedic scenes the hippy hearse crashing into the airport hanger door stands out but that's where the good things end and we begin to see the aspects that make this movie so truly disappointing the character of robert forster as gram's actual father is an invention so disgraceful as to cast a taint over the entire film we all know his real father committed suicide when he was young something that could surely be compared to gram's life on the edge by a better film maker having forster as his supposed real father and not his step father would be bad enough if not for the well known difficulties gram had with the man who actually flew to collect his body it has been suggested that his step father had admitted to providing gram's mother with alcohol as she lay dying and that this enraged gram when he later found out about it also the controversy over where gram's body was buried would surely be reason enough not to invent a benevolent made up father who actually catches up to the duo and their hearse but then allows them to go ahead with the burning whatever the truth about the man who gram got the name parsons from he certainly bore no resemblance to forster's character here and it is hard to see why this role was written then there's the addition of christina applegate as a greedy chick yet very pretty of course who wants gram's body back so that she can begin to cash in on his estate her character and her acting are non existent and one wonders why the director didn't just go the whole hog and include a lesbo scene between her and the chick who plays kaufman's girlfriend it wouldn't have lowered the tone a whole lot more when you think of the ingredients that could have been used in a good movie about parsons the shortcomings of this film are easily apparent country music being changed by a young polite southern gentleman who was also long haired drug loving popular with the ladies and ultimately self destructive real events like the hanger door crash and the painted hearse and friends like keith richards instead of these things we have to concentrate wholly on kaufman's input into gram's life kaufman is obviously still lapping up the cult status he received for what he did he certainly is a little cult from interviews it is obvious that he's delighted with the attention remember this is the man who made a remark about the genitalia of the naked corpse of gram parsons as he was preparing to set it alight what he did was not an act of great loyalty but a doped up alcoholic escapade looking at knoxville and the director in interviews a few things become clear also it's obvious that they have no real grasp of the story of gram's life nor do they wish to have they want a hit movie about an event that is infamous and crazy it was an amazing life with a strange end that the end is the only thing covered by this movie shows how limited an understanding of gram parsons the makers had
<START> ok let's get right to the point we have five recent college grads must have majored in the f word going out on a weekend camping trip they run into someone who is in need of help but instead of trying to assist him they decide to set him on fire instead nice bunch of people next some of them start go get sick must be something in the water at the cabin they are staying at however the neighbors seem to be ok oh well when things start getting really bad they lock up one their companions instead of getting help try the neighbor by the way some locals don't take a liking to them they chase one on a high speed romp through the woods for many miles until the truck breaks down somehow ten minutes later he shows up at the cabin how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery another of the brain surgeon type at the cabin realizes something is amiss so he hides out in a cave to let this blow over he then decides the next day to return to the cabin believing it must be some type of shrine he is giddy with relief that he survived he must have thought it was a 24 hour bug unfortuneatley he is met by some not so friendly police officers another couple decide to have sex while the flesh eating bug is working its magic and then the women realizes she needs to shave her legs taking a lot of the diseased skin with shaving cream anyway you get the idea nothing makes sense here these are five people i would not want to be friends with i was rooting for the flesh eating bacteria other characters were introduced who were also somewhat amusing but utterly unlikeable as well ninety minutes of good life wasted here
<START> this sequel is a total rehash of the first film a completely pointless movie it basically just took every single sceanrio of the first film and they redid it in omen iv except with a female antichrist this time it even ends the same way as the first one the music is too busy and interfering and because its pretty much a copy of omen i it's extremely predictable it's not a horrible movie it's not terribly made there is much worse movies out there this just had absolutely no point in being made the omen remake from 2006 is much worse even more pointless than this so i guess it has that if you someone pointed a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reamke i guess i'd choose this
<START> rumors is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring private snafu the films were aimed at servicemen and were directed animated and scored by some of the top talent from warner bros ' termite terrace including friz freleng chuck jones and carl stalling the invaluable mel blanc supplied the voice for snafu and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by theodor geisel i e dr seuss the idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery using the character of snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope the little twerp who would do everything you're not supposed to do according to chuck jones the scripts had to be approved by pentagon officials but army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow all for the greater good of course br br as the title would indicate this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors the setting is an army camp private snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine something you won't see in any other hollywood films of the era and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling we observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted then exaggerated then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp the imagery is indeed vivid the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air i e balloon juice a soldier shoots his mouth off cannon style and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction winged baloney at that panicked soldiers tell each other that the brooklyn bridge has been pulverized coney island wiped out enemy troops have landed on the white house lawn and the japanese are in california the visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for rumor itis and private snafu has been locked up in a padded cell br br this is a highly effective piece of work the filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy and the message is still a valid one in recent years we've seen that catastrophic events real or imagined can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances because the technology has improved the private snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e mail cellphones and blogging consequently rumors is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn't feel at all dated in fact it may be more timely than ever
<START> although there are a lot of familiar television names associated with a man called sledge there is nothing extraordinary about the film itself or about any of the performances in fact the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960's 70's television series like the rat patrol is a bigger cast and a lot more violence br br james garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedy stuff he had been doing maverick support your local sheriff gunfighter etc unfortunately his earthy likability works against him as sledge is a humorless character written to cash in on the popularity of clint eastwood's spaghetti western character but eastwood's stuff was not this flat and uninteresting br br i suppose that a man called sledge could be classified as a spaghetti western although the pacing is too slow to really fit that sub genre fans of the slow paced combat television series will feel an instant connection as vic morrow directed the film and co wrote the script with frank kowalski throw in some then trendy slow mo shots and cross dissolves which call attention to themselves rather than serve a story telling purpose br br the plot is the standard big heist thing insert the war wagon here with sledge plotting how to heist a 300 000 gold shipment his gang includes claude akins and dennis weaver the problem is that while on the move the shipment is guarded by 40 outriders and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison i think there was an episode of alias smith and jones with the same plot br br the story would make a decent hour of television but gets old very fast as a very padded feature length film garner does not allow any of his charm to leak into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to hold a viewer's interest br br the thing finally crashes and burns shortly after the heist when the gang engages in a contrived and totally illogical card game br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> for the first forty minutes empire really shapes itself up it appears to be a strong confident and relatively unknown gangster flick at the time i didn't know why i thought it was good but now i do br br one of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful i don't mind films with psychos and things to prove a point take jackie brown for example but they're all so terribly shallow in this but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment you literally feel a knot pull in your stomach another major problem is the protagonist he is smug arrogant yet ironically enough not that bad he doesn't seem tight enough to be a drug dealing woman killer the fact is at the end of the day this film is completely pretentious not slick not clever just dull and meaningless this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs br br out of 1 out of 5
<START> calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading the genre has sadly deteriorated into cliches too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories making it formulaic and overly predictable br br the shop around the corner does not suffer from these illnesses it manages to create a recognisably middle eastern european atmosphere and has a strong cast besides the also strong nominal leads i avoid using the words 'supporting cast' as for example mr matuschek frank morgan has a central role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the romance br br the 1998 film you've got mail borrowed the 'anonymous pen pal' idea from this film and has therefore been billed as a remake this is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie it shares the genre and borrows a plot element but that is all
<START> i think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best 'national lampoon's' films it also has a very catchy spoof title which basically sums up what the whole movie is about men in white the story is a spoof of many films including a will smith film as you might have guessed 'men in black' i will not give the ending away but it has a very good ending in is very funny leslie nielsen style humour from start to finish especially the bit near the beginning when thy are in the street collecting the dustbins garbage cans also they have a pretty cool dustbin lorry garbage collecting truck in that scene too the acting is not superb actually it is not very good but that is what makes the film funny it is a comedy loosen up i love the story line partly because it is so far fetched and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle or should it be un subtle they rip off all the other films i am great fan of un serious spoof films but i am also a fan of the real thing and with this films it is hard to decide which is better the film it mainly rips off mentioned earlier i this review or the actual film it is but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films it actually makes it even harder but this film carries it off successfully the two garbage men are so funny it reminds me of a tv sketch show in the uk called 'little britain' this film is a must for your collection and is one of the best most entertaining funniest best storyline national lampoon's film to date
<START> this is an amazing film both for the incredibly energy evoked from the frenetic flamenco dancing and from the unique way that the filmmakers interweave the story of the stage production with the lives of the characters preparing for it spellbinding is the only word i can use to describe the experience this is not 'bizet's carmen' by any usual standard this is not a usual film by any standard every nuanced glance every stomp of the foot every piece of the music is intertwined so captivatingly that you can't take your eyes off the screen you don't need to love opera or flamenco i don't to be captured enraptured enthralled by this film subtle and direct loud and still one of if not the best movies of it's kind because there are so few like it
<START> possible spoilers coming up you've been forewarned br br this is absolutely one of my all time favorite musicals and movie musicals the other is damn yankees with gwen verdon tab hunter and ray walston as we all know sometimes the luster not to mention the songs of a show are lost in its transition from stage to screen this is for the most part definitely not the case here br br the sets are divine bright and colorful the characters are bigger than life and you can't help but love them and michael kidd's choreography is absolutely stunning so glad to know they used the original broadway choreographer br br all of the actors bounce the ball that is have unbeatable chemistry to perfection in this film frank and marlon are absolutely believable as the proprietor of the oldest established permanent floating crap game in new york and the most notorious gambler who bets on even the most minute things such as his fever going up to 104 if he doesn't take penicillin sweet fresh faced jean simmons is perfect for the role of sarah although it is true her singing pipes are not as outstanding as that of isabel bigley or josie de guzman the mission doll with a heart of gold and a drive to heal all and last but certainly not least on my list anyway is miss vivian blaine reprising her broadway role as miss adelaide the hot box lead singer and dancer who would like to finally end her 14 year engagement to nathan with marriage and rid herself of the psychosomatic cold he's given her br br first off kudos to stubby kaye and b s pulley as they reprise their broadway roles as nicely nicely johnson and benny southstreet there were never two more loveable gamblers than these guys br br brando is superb as usual and though he's not got the voice of robert alda or peter gallagher you forget it as he has this sense of determination to bring all he can to his role as sky masterson luck be a lady gives me chills every time i see him perform the number especially enjoyable is hearing him say daddy i got cider in my ear br br simmons is charming and pleasant in a role well suited to her looks voice and the way she carries herself you long so dearly for her not only to win sky or toward the end believe him but to help people overcome their gambling drinking and other sins and live a life with god her rendition of if i were a bell is splendid to say the least br br sinatra is the man he is so perfect for the role of nathan detroit and here he sings parts that sam levene from the broadway cast never could terrific actor but the chap was tone deaf go figure i really enjoyed the addition of the song adelaide wish some guy would sing like that to me frankie's cool slick demeanor transcends the boundaries of this movie but most importantly you want him to marry adelaide br br and speaking of adelaide vivian blaine is just sheer perfection in this role from the accent to her belting out adelaide's lament she's just terrific and she's also my favorite part of the entire movie she really makes you feel for adelaide especially when she cries right before and then again during sue me i still haven't decided whether i like pet me poppa better than bushel and a peck maybe i like them equally either way she does fantastic with those as well as take back your mink i'm sad that they left out hollanderize from the film she's absolutely marvelous not to mention hilarious and my favorite part of the entire film br br one of the best things about this movie is their lingo it's a mixture of high class and street slang never do they use it's i'll or that's it's always it is i will and that is overall guys dolls is one of my favorite all time movies and musicals and it's one that you should take time to watch every time it comes on my only complaint no marry the man today now that's a good song
<START> as a fan of science fiction movies i have been aware of the matrix since its release in 1999 from the little bit i would allow people to tell me about it i assumed it was highly original and sophisticated i am also a devotee of alice in wonderland i could never quite figure out how i missed the matrix when it was released with the imminent release of the matrix reloaded it was time to buy the dvd and watch it br br the disappointment was too great the premise of the matrix the controlling device as opposed to the movie was clever the philosophical premise of parallel worlds alternate realities is shopworn however i could still have bought into the film as science fiction if it stayed firmly in that genre unfortunately it turned into a standard will they or won't they escape break through rescue those in need of rescue etc to make matters worse it turned out to be another martial arts exercise the problem is that science fiction and martial arts films are really two different types to the purest the devotee of one or the other mixing the two doesn't work it is like mixing science fiction with romance you can have one or the other but not both in the same film or at least not both to the same extent in the same movie br br if there were such problems with the matrix the matrix reloaded really compounded the problems at least thirty minutes of the film were either martial arts sequences or the protracted car chase this observation ignores the question made in every professional negative review of the movie if neo could do the superman thing why bother to fight at all the answer of course is that's what draws the young male demographic group into the theatre then there is the redemption through love aspect that plot device was worn out by richard wagner over a hundred years ago it was actually handled better by him in die gotterdammerung br br so where does that leave those who saw the matrix reloaded martial arts fans probably groaned through the trite but arcane sci fi philosophizing science fictions fans were wondering why they were sitting through a kung fun fest most of the males in the audience where probably bored by the silly romance aspect of the film br br just what are you supposed to be getting for your bucks when you see the matrix franchise films science fiction martial arts or soap opera a bit of each does not make for a whole lot more of any of them nor for a satisfying film for the afficionados of each
<START> clint eastwood returns as dirty harry calahan in the 4th movie of the dirty harry series clint is older but he's still got it harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery where the memorable make my day catchphrase comes from but the city he took a vacation was worse a woman turned vigilante after a rape attack in a funfair and starts getting the punks one by one the last movie to see sandra locke in a clint eastwood movie an improvement after the enforcer which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious clint eastwood's sunglasses were gargoyles which are best known for the sunglasses that are worn by arnold shwartzeneger in the terminator worth a watch if you like clint eastwood the dirty harry films or like action crime thrillers
<START> i love this movie but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid br br the fateful game took place in 1972 that means that the protagonists graduated in 1972 but almost all of the music played at the dances etc is from the 1950s and very early 1960s br br having just attended my 30th high school reunion i can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents' music br br i understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music we all know what a desolate time it was musically but it wasn't completely bereft and the producers of the film should have taken more care i found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film br br this was a bad director and or producer decision
<START> david lean's worst film even 'in which we serve' was'nt as bad as this usually a film with a really good reputation like this one has at least some redeeming qualities which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic but after watching this i just could not get why this piece of crap was liked so much even back in 1945 i disliked the acting stiff upper lip british mannerisms story script which may be quite witty at times but totally unfunny and soundtrack the elvira character is meant to be alluring and attractive but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation another very overrated 'british classic'
<START> this movie is not that interesting except for the first ten minutes the pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece even better than say gosford park then it inexplicably slows down loses focus and starts resembling a traditional french movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between antoine depardieu and cÃ©cile deneuve in the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story several threads started are not ended br br spoilers ahead the main story is the relation between antoine and cÃ©cile he has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago despite her remarrying and setting up home in morocco as builder he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of cÃ©cile's marriage having accomplished this he is buried after a freak accident literally and becomes a comatose he wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that they've reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together end of spoilers br br it remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here illegal immigrants want to enter europe there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of iraq's former regime cÃ©cile's child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs loyalty once he meets his boyfriend whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick of that her sister is traditional islamic and enters a relation with cÃ©cile's husband it portrays morocco as unnecessary backward despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past it portrays islam as backward and prone to extremism which may sometimes be true but certainly not in general in the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and l'art pour l'art br br deneuve and depardieu are great with this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene lifting an eyebrow body language radiating pride awkward behavior the movie itself is disappointing and only confirming the limited role of french cinema in the world nowadays with some notable exceptions of course
<START> after having seen a lot of greek movies i feel very suspicious against most of them but after watching this i felt astonished the movies is great without a big try you cannot claim that the screenplay is so great or the photography is perfect or something technical it's a real story and it is happening in greek rural areas in places forgotten from god the movie is like a punch in the stomach and i would really wish that things are not like this it obviously talks about the xenophobia of the greek people the ignorance to anything different the problem of this guy is not that he is an ex convicted the problem is that he is not one of these people he is different and they do not want them that's why all the good things he is doing turn boomerang to him and also speaks about the apathy of the people because there are some people who are against the hunting of the king but they do not dare to say their opinion in the end you can clearly see the hypocrisy of the society being religious and trying to act like god says but at the same time acting so unfairly to the king this shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or their beliefs according to the established system in the end you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story meaning that you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them if you want to remain different and even alone you are lost and it is not far from reality i think it is tragic that the story is real and this should be a bell for everybody no comment for the main actor because he is already given an award and i believe that his play was great small comment for hatzisavvas plays the policeman he is like a dinosaur he has played a lot of roles and i'm sure that this role for him was very easy but he plays it so great that you cannot deny him a big bravo i definitely recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a good greek movie
<START> i just rented and watched this movie just to see what's all the fuss about so here's what my reactions to it are it's easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors the main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists this concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film however the movie doesn't shock or disturb me at all it just bored me this movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes all lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time like those scenery scenes and some scenes i described below br br contains spoiler i find the rape scenes quite tame i don't know if i have watched the cut or uncut version if there is actually such a version i also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot here's a list on top of my mind br br why don't the rapists rape jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are that would be an excellent time br br why don't they just gang rape her instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening jennifer's ordeal by such a long time it would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way br br i found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles br br these rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right they shouldn't send a coward imbecile to do the job br br why didn't jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left which should be the first thing that pops up in most people's mind especially for someone who is a writer br br why didn't these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw jennifer is alive br br i find it really amazing that a slender lady like camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him ends spoiler br br but hey this movie is not without its merits camille keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i have recently heard when matthew protest of going back into the house and kills jennifer why me why me i didn't even c m '
<START> saw this movie twice at community screenings and really loved it i work in the jane finch community and feel the film really captured some of the essence and flavour of the community grit determination exuberance creativity in your faceness with a dose of desperation the writing dialogue and acting is solid and i really found myself drawn into the story of the young woman raya as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process great dance sequences and it is not only the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence as well all the characters are multi dimensional none wholly good or bad and the women characters are admirably strong this is a film that has a strong beating heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth hip hop and communities like jane finch
<START> spoilers powerhouse movie that shows how men in desperate situations can go so far as sacrifice their best friends and family members and not realize what monsters that they are by doing it until like in the case of bull like gypo noland victor mclaglen it's too much too late br br it's 1922 and the hight of the black tan irish revolt against the mighty british empire with the tans british occupying troops on the lookout for wanted irish republican rebel frankie mcphillip wallace ford wanted for the killing of a briish soldier gypo a good really the best friend of the fugitive mcphillip is down on his luck not having a job with his girlfriend katie margot grahame forced to turn tricks in the dublin red light district in order to pay her rent br br after an outraged gypo worked over a potential john who want's to spend a few hours with katie for a shilling or two an angry katie tells the not so bright gyro that he's preventing her for supporting herself with the only bankable asset she has her body katie also tells gypo that he should wake up to reality and realize what a desperate situation that she's in telling the mind numbed gypo that it would only cost ten pound sterling for her to go to america and get out of the poverty of ireland gypo suddenly remembers a poster of his good friend frankie mcphillip that he just saw announcing a reward of 20 pound sterling thats enough money for both him and kaite to travel to america br br gypo going to a local dublin flop house and soup kitchen to get a free meal is startled to run into his friend frankie mcphillip frankie tells him that he snuck into dublin to see both his mother mrs mcphillip and sister mary una o'connor heather angel and if he can make sure that everything is safe for him to go home and later leave for his irish republican unit outside the city br br all gypo can see in frankie's face is the 20 pound sterling reward for him being turned into the police without as much of a second thought after he assured frankie that everything is all right gypo secretly goes to the police and informs on his friend who's later shot and killed in a police and tan shootout in his moms house br br with the deed done the chief of police hands over the 20 pound sterling much like thirty pieces of silver to an almost emotionless gypo who takes it and sneaks out the back door of the police station so that one one can see him you can see in the police chief's face and actions that he has nothing but utter contempt for gypo's betrayal of his friend frankie mcphillip even though he was wanted for murder and an enemy of the british empire that's how low traitors or informers are held even by those whom they secretly work for br br gypo turns out to be his own worst enemy after his betrayal of frankie as his conscience takes control of his mind gypo sees and hears everyone including his unsuspecting girlfriend katie pointing a finger and implicating him in frankie's betrayal and death at the hands of the british authorities gypo's guilty mind has him getting himself royally and gloriously drunk on the reward money that by the time he's forced to to admit his crime to his irish republican army colleagues who had the almost dead drunk and slobbering gypo on trial the money was just about gone in his partying drinking and whoring br br whatever good feelings if that's possible that you had for the weak minded and strong shouldered gypo was completely demolished when in an act of total desperation in order to keep from getting shot he falsely implicate an innocent man mulligan donald meek in his crime of informing on his friend frankie mcphillip which is quickly exposed as a total fabrication by non other then the guilt ridden gypo himself the dye is then cast as straws are drawn for who would be the one to put a bullet in gypo's head for the final gut spilling chapter of this heart wrenching and unforgettable crime punishment classic
<START> ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces i found only the egyptian one disappointing stragely all but the mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9 11 the afghan refugees deaf people palestinians the widows of srebrenica aids and poverty and corruption in africa pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath suicide bombings in israel paranoia hit and state persecuted muslim americans in the usa old people living alone and the aftermath of wwii in the hearts of asian soldiers this might say something sad about the limits of empathy in both ways the directors might feel that americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies while they effectively do the same with their short films br br surprising myself i found sean penn's piece one of the very best in the collection and spoiler ahead i also guess his portrayal of ernest borgnine as a half crazy old man vegetating in a new york flat experiencing his widow life's happiest moment when the sun shines through his window after the wtc collapsed out of light's way i guess this might also be one of the most offending as the general american audience would see it
