<START> in my opinion october sky is one of the best movies of 1999 it totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need like wonderful story and good character interactions october sky will remain in heart for as long as i can remember and i just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film
<START> i'm not saying that because the production values were so low but because it was filmed terribly that shot of the girl washing her hair in the creek did we really need to sit there for an overlong shot and watch her do that for 5 minutes in the same spot it was terrible the lighting was just plain bad you could barely see anything and when the characters were talking you could barely hear what they were saying did i watch the whole movie of course not i skipped through most of it and i don't want to hear anyone say i need to watch the whole thing first to judge it this film was so poorly done and executed that even by independent and low budget standards it's just plain terrible awful movie don't waste any time on it unless you want a good laugh but even then it's not because of the actors funny lines it's because of how painstakingly bad the production is
<START> i totally disagree with the other reviews all basically negative i took a chance on this movie and was glad that i did glad indeed i couldn't find anything wrong with it nothing period the script is original the actors are all likable and convincing dee smart reminded me of marcia brady from the brady bunch but this gal truly can act the setting in the australian outback is perfect incredible scenery great soundtrack i e paul kelly god bless paul kelly the cranberries are also here i have seen this movie twice in less than 24 hrs i will probably watch it again it is that interesting it makes one think it is was probably better than nine tenths of the so called hollywood blockbusters that were also out during this time back of beyond is a likable well photographed film i couldn't find anything wrong with it check it out my first review
<START> what was always missing with the matrix story was how things came to be in the real world say no more because this part of the story covered most of the bases what was truly interesting was how political it was maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration fascism and violence were the only things man could think of in regards to fighting the robotic horde who were meant as nothing more than servants to humanity what i also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of the unknown we as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often letting the lack of logic and thought overtake us because people can't believe the contrary well represented and put together this a true testament to how illogical humans can be
<START> most of the feedback i've heard concerning meatball machine has been pretty mixed a couple even saying that they think it sucked well to those people i say get some f ckin imagination and go f ck yourself this was a very entertaining flick br br the story starts with this mechanical bug which attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these gwar costume looking deathbots called necroborgs eventually you learn that these mechanical bugs also attach a little parasite onto you which then is able to control your actions due to hot wiring your nervous system unfortunately for two love seeking lonely young adults they happen to cross paths with the mechanical bug and before you know it transformations are taking place and blood is being splattered is there a way to stop the transformation maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat why do the necroborgs fight one another do the two desperate singles get to express their feelings for one another and do the nasty only one way to find out br br going into meatball machine i was kinda wary due to the mixed reactions but it turned out being a great surprise a few unanswered questions some average acting at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points i can think of from the anime feel to it to the parasites becoming little characters themselves and even to the low budget feel this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses with a ever developing story that's interesting enough to keep oneself asking questions throughout mixed with the cool make up effects and blood splatter this is one flick fans of bizarro horror tetsuo splatter fans should check out 8 outta 10
<START> abysmal with a capital a this has got to be one of if not the unfunniest show on tv right now i'm about as anti bush as it gets but this show doesn't even get a chuckle out of me what you think of bush as a president has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you'll like this piece of crap show the jokes are not funny at all for example in a scene when lil bush has his underwear on his head welcome to camp al qa eeda there is nothing funny about that is it even supposed to be joke the commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show hyping it up were funnier than the show itself and that's just sad hopefully this does not even get considered for a second season it shouldn't even have had a first
<START> this 1977 cult movie has two crazed lesbians sandra locke colleen camp appearing at the home of wealthy socialite doctor george manning seymour cassel in hope of help in locating a residence they can't seem to find but these two have other plans in mind when they find out george's wife is out of town they end up taking control of the residence tying up the george killing a delivery boy while destroying the place all in one evening bizarre and disturbing movie but the two get there just reward in the same bizarre way as the movie ends most will either dislike it right off or get caught up in this ludicrous movie after about 30 minutes into it either way some even consider this a cult classic br br larry dodson
<START> this picture reminds me of a keneth more picture from 1957 called the admirable crighton whilst on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and upon being saved reverted back to servant madonna did ok in some movies however this one doesn't fire if there is any picture that show madonna can't act it is this one br br i am not sure whether this was a subtle copy of the admirable crighton but it sure looks like it and if thats the case then hollywood must be running out of ideas and that is sad to provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and just on that this fails in every corner and detail br br the plot is loose and the acting is mediocre the script should have been put thru the shredder before taking it on location while many here have canned madoona for all her acting i think that in films like a league of their own was quite good and enjoyable and who's that girl showed a quirkiness of madonna's style not shown before or afterwards other madonna films are not as enjoyable and i would have liked a to see a madonna animation series with the character from who's that girl i like the music from these two films however swept away remains at the bottom of the pile here and will remain so br br everyone has a bomb right
<START> a dreary and pointless bit of fluff bloody fluff but fluff badly scripted with inane and wooden dialogue you do not care if the characters indeed even if the actors themselves live or die little grace or charm little action little point to the whole thing perhaps some of the set and setting will interest those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived the framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting and the hoppalong cassidy character himself is both boring and inept
<START> if you haven't seen this obscure little charmer you should seek it out it is the story of a bumbling wartime sad sack fred macmurray who is listed 4 f each time he attempts to join any branch of the military he finds a magic lamp which of course contains a genie gene sheldon but the genie is even more bumbling than macmurray is sending him across time to serve in all the wrong times and places than the one he wants it is cute cheerful and pure fluff and you can't help but like it the plots is much like a disney film particularly since the two stars macmurray and sheldon both made numerous disney films in the 50's and 60's although not together needless to say it all ends well for everyone and the viewer goes away feeling pretty good
<START> i watched mask in the 80's and it's currently showing on fox kids in the uk very late at night i remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears i never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was it's just plain awful it is no where near in the same league as the transformers he man or thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made i only watch it on fox kids because ulysses 31 comes on straight after it that's if mask doesn't put me to sleep first one of the lesser 80's cartoons that i hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on fox kids
<START> allow yourself to be transported to a different old school kind of storytelling scoop is classic woody allen br br allen's latest muse scarlett johansson who also appeared in last year's match point also by allen is surprisingly able to tone down her sultry sex kitten appeal and transform into a normal looking student type with the aid of nerdish glasses and outfits but still fails to make the audience believe how hugh jackman's lordly character can be so smitten by her given the royal's background don't worry no spoilers here there are no grand transformations for johansson's character here as she consistently plays the same character throughout despite the script saying otherwise you even forgive her character's apparent lack of logic continuing an affair with a suspected serial killer simply because he is his royal hotness jackman who is refreshing to see sans the wolverine duds br br if anything consistency is what the 70 year old allen is all about he continues to tell his stories on celluloid in the same way he always has as if he's never been exposed to modern film making which is probably what makes his quiet simple films appealing they never seem to aim for a specific market as if allen makes movies to his taste alone whether the public likes it or not
<START> many of the classic films of the late '60s haven't retained their ability to disturb and confront the audience in cold blood hasn't lost an ounce of its power its exceptionally well made yet forces the viewer to think some have complained not only about the film but about truman capote's source non fiction novel that the central message is unsubtle that may be true but this is definitely a case where the lack of ambiguity doesn't detract from the film at all its refreshing especially considering today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas to see a film with a convinced political voice unafraid to force the audience to consider its viewpoint to be honest i'm not sure if i agree with the film's central message but i admire its audacity nonetheless br br even if you disagree with the anti capital punishment message there's plenty to admire about the film the acting from the two leads is terrific scott wilson still one of the most underrated actors ever is chilling as the nihilistic leader one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses robert blake is also chilling as the more submissive of the two and the one with a conscience his character obviously has a voice of reason but is terrified to go against wilson theres a good amount of homoerotic subtext on his character's part the cinematography is terrific sleek yet gritty and really giving the impression the viewer is watching a documentary add another classic score from quincey jones and you have a masterpiece 9 10
<START> if you know the story of grey owl you'll love the movie annie galipeau is a great actress and pierce is better than never in grey owl but in this movie there's no real scene of action i think this movie should be nominated at the oscars welll go see this movie it's a classic
<START> it took 9 years to complete this film i would think that within those 9 years someone would have said hey this film is terrible i've seen better acting in porn movies the story is tired and played abused child turns into serial killer how about something new for a change how about abused child turns into a florist at least that would have been a new twist why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea especially unoriginal movie ideas thinks that they can be a director i do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for 9 years to get it completed that shows tenacity and spirit with this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script if you want to see a failed experiment in indie film making from a writer director from michigan see hatred of a minute if you want a good movie from a michigan writer director stick with evil dead
<START> this movie is definately one of my favourite movies in it's kind the interaction between respectable and morally uncorruptable characters is an ode to chivalry and the honour code amongst thieves and policemen it treats themes like duty guilt word manipulation and trust like few films have done and unfortunately none that i can recall since the death of the 'policial' in the late seventies the sequence is delicious down to the essential living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake no such scenes are present or needed the argument is flowless and honest to the spectator wich is an important asset in a genre in wich the the suspense is often achieved through the betrail of the audience no this is not miss marble a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savour every minute not just to see
<START> my wife and i both thought this film a watered down made for tv bbc version of manhattan murder mystery which is itself good but not great the story has little inter character tension or chemistry and not much of a plot woody allen's character just sort of wanders around running off at the mouth and hugh jackman and scarlett johannsson don't have a lot more to do it's pretty disappointing i must say ian mcshane's role is just an expanded cameo appearance br br the first thing that occurred to me was i wonder how much the bbc had to pay woody allen to dislodge him from manhatttan he must've needed the money and they must have needed his appeal to expand their audience beyond the youth market drawn to the two stars i'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it is unbothersome background noise if you ever want something to have on while you're knitting or sorting your stamp collection this'll do the job i wouldn't pay to rent it again
<START> many reviews i've read reveals that most people tend to like part one better than part two i feel exactly the opposite part one played around a bit much with trying to find different ways of showing che guevara's personality through different types of film stock different locations and cutting back and forth between an interview and the cuban revolution for the most part it was structured finely but somewhat distracting in part two che enters bolivia and along with changing geographical location the rules and the structure changes gone are the spacial jumps and switching between stocks the documentary realism and the treatises instead now we are literally trapped with che in a desaturated depopulated landscape where the only people who exist are burdened too far with their lives for anything but survival to be an option i posit that it's the dark turn of che's life that is the real reason why most people prefer part one to part two br br the change in geographic location also signifies for me at least that che part one and che part two are in fact the second two acts of a three act structure begun by motorcycle diaries motorcycle diaries is che's coming of age or more appropriately coming of ideals in argentina che part one is his military leadership in cuba and che part two is his downfall in bolivia these movies do not completely illustrate his life we're missing his experiences in guatamala and more importantly in my opinion his post cuban revolution executions but they create a very detailed exploration into the controversial aspects of his character and nature as worldwide symbol he both symbolizes the idealism and need for armed resistance to oppression and revolutionary failings in the post world war ii third world countries and their hindering by such activities as um the cias meddling br br but yet again all of that is projected on screen in this case not through long scenes of dialog and speeches but through a much more intimate suffering portrayal of che at the end of his thread and his life again the rules have changed and in this case it's hard to tell if there was any chance of success at all the number of times the camera shows people literally trapped between a rock and a hard place and the desaturated shaky long takes involves the audience into the narrative of people imprisoned in a hostile landscape an existential hell where revolutionary beliefs ultimately end up taking second tier to the desperation of hunted people starving to death it's just not that easy of a movie to watch but it's very effective br br polarisdib
<START> i can't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the american audience to the dynamo that is jet li fist of legend would have been a much better choice anyway black mask isn't terrible but it certainly isn't great either the final fight sequence is well staged by yuen woo ping who went on to coordinate the matrix but the english release suffers from rough editing and dubbing i'm begging the hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles jet li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role and francoise yip has a cool but brief role as the female 701 br br black mask has a strange goth style that adds some interest but it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions more focus on li's fantastic physical skills were in order black mask is a decent film but do yourself a favor and pick up fist of legend if you want to see a tremendous film that really shows li's skills
<START> i love this movie beautifully funny and utterly believable characters each scene richer and more wonderful than the last every aspect of this movie is filled with wit and humour and love and depth a complex and engrossing story too this movie is filled with love humour and intelligence totally great
