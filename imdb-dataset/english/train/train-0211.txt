<START> sophia loren plays aida in one of the worst films of all time she can't lipsync in terms of production values the film is so bad that at one point while loren is mouthing o patria mia she leans onto what looks to be a stone wall for support and the canvas set billows and shakes
<START> the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend her aunt edna may oliver a person too talented for this film didn't like wheeler a sentiment i can easily relate to the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from wheeler they left and wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king at about the same time woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king so when wheeler arrived it was up to the boys to fight it out but they refused because they are already friends which greatly disappointed the people as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime br br i am a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywood the silent era through the 1940s i have seen and reviewed hundreds if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films i have never been able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolsey the only comedy team that might be as bad as the ritz brothers despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey i can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better for example there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brother's film duck soup yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp at times woolsey talked a bit like groucho but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny in fact he just seemed to prattle pointlessly his only funny quality was that he looked goofy surely not enough reason to put him on film additionally wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese a piece of cheese that sang very poorly a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as who's on first which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing in fact soon after they started their spiel they just ended the routine so prematurely that you are left frustrated i knew that who's on first had been around for many years and used by many teams but i really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist br br once again i have found yet another sub par film by this duo while i must admit that i liked a few of their films mildly such as silly billies and the rainmakers which i actually gave 6's to on imdb this one was a major endurance test to complete something that i find happens all too often when i view the films of wheeler and woolsey where was all the humor
<START> look carefully at the wonderful assortment of talent put together to make this movie connery fishburne capshaw harris underwood beatty thigpen even cameos by slezak lange and plimpton they prove in spades the adage that a good cast cannot save a bad script the story line requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its implausibility should have exceeded even hollywood standards it's not particularly original and the twists are downright cruel
<START> i bought the dvd version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television but the version put to dvd was a disaster the lighting was poor to non existent and entire scenes were simply excised in one instance adele is being put to bed and we immediately cut to another scene coming in in mid sentence where it's the next night characters such as grace poole and mason are never even introduced leaving one to wonder if they'd dozed off for a few minutes during the movie br br the dvd we saw was produced by platinum disc corp and even at 6 32 it was a gyp br br be careful which version of this movie you buy we're sending this one back
<START> please save your money and go see something else this movie was such piece of crap i didnt want to go but i had to so i thought i'd laugh at least once nope not a single laugh it was that horrible chris kattan will never get a good comedy role after this and a night at the roxbury this movie is completely obvious has no smart humor at all and just repeats itself over and over again listen to me and stray as far away from this movie as you possibly can
<START> seriously i don't even know where to begin it's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic third grader and said 'make me a movie about the secret service' the editing is ridiculous the cinematography was random at best every single syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing well was there even a director there everything was just so pointless and lame and pointless and random and lame br br here's a spoiler for you this movie is the dumbest thing you'll ever see br br however if you liked this piece you'll also enjoy deterrance dark blue and a partial frontal lobotomy
<START> having heard quite positive reviews and having seen the trailer i had to see this movie with william h macy luis guzman michael jeter and sam rockwell present it had to be good and it delivered overall the movie is not crack you up funny but there is one scene that really stands out and is in a my eyes a classic spoiler at the end where they break through the wall to get to the safe and we see rockwell and washington stare at jeter is just fantastic this is just as good as the scene in the big lebowski where the dude is using a chair to barricade his door but forgets the door turns outward end spoiler just go see this movie you won't be disappointed
<START> american nightmare is officially tied in my opinion with it's pat for the worst movie of all time br br seven friends oddly resembling the k mart version of the cast of friends gather in a coffee shop to listen to american nightmare a pirate radio show it's hosted by a guy with a beard that's the most exciting aspect of his show br br chandler monica joey and oh wait i mean wayne jessie and the rest of the bad one liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded dj unbeknownst to them a crazed nurse serial killer is listening br br crazy nurse then proceeds to torture ross and rachel and wait sorry again by making their fears come to life these fears include such stunners as voodoo and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures br br no really br br this movie was in a word rotten crazy nurse's killing spree lacks motivation there's nothing to make the viewer jump the ending blows and again voodoo br br if you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones rent american nightmare with them br br if you care for your loved ones even a little bit go to your local blockbuster rent all of the copies of american nightmare and hide them in your freezer
<START> this was a nice attempt at something but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above it's low budget trappings the use of virtual sets almost works but at some points it fails miserably they made good use of the small budget i guess i just wish the story and most of the acting was better there are a lot of parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if they actually hit those marks but they don't confusing and unbelievable story bad dvd transfer too it doesn't take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting this i had to shut off it was too boring i can do slow movies but just make them appealing in some aspect visually story wise acting etc this was lacking in all departments so it never added up to an engrossing experience maybe the film maker's next attempt will be better
<START> this one and her pilgrim soul are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone as i mentioned in my comment on the new series there's something lacking in this new series maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned it's a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling's version however this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too i think the appeal is that no matter what they do the lovers can never unite i remember i wasn't surprised by the korean movie il mare later remade into the lake house i think it's because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film
<START> whatever the merits of the film it is poorly researched as others have pointed out the movie shows locals in iran speaking in arabic rather than persian that is enough to lose credibility for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country the landscape could not be more different from the actual br br other factual errors a train is shown to be operating in afghanistan while afghanistan does not have railways the turkish ambassador is wearing a fez the red hat whereas the fez was banned by turkey much before the time in which the movie is set the turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an indian and indian classical music is playing in the background in many scenes i suppose the filmmakers meant to show an exotic woman and sari was what they decided would make her exotic
<START> the problem with portraying a real life individual is that the performance can be good but still not work if the audience doesn't believe that the actor is portraying the person that's the main issue with young mr lincoln henry fonda gives a terrific performance but i found it hard to believe that abraham lincoln was as soft spoken as fonda portrays him br br this is essentially a courtroom drama with a young abraham licoln at the forefront whether or not this was a true story i don't know but if it isn't then why tell it using lincoln as the central character never mind though in the film lincoln is defending two young men who are accused of murder br br there's really not much to the film and as a result it seems rather empty i wanted more story and character development the film is 100 minutes long but it doesn't feel like it there are some little scenes featuring lincoln and the blooming relationship with mary todd but they seem superficial br br the acting is good all around but as i said fonda's performance works as a character but not abraham lincoln i just don't believe that the real lincoln was that soft spoken true he has a big voice when he needs to such as when he persuades a drunken lynch mob to let the accused stand trial but fonda portrays lincoln too meekly the other performances are solid though especially alice brady as abigail clay the mother of the accused she's a nice lady who we can really feel for simple and uneducated yet very sweet we can see why lincoln wanted to help her br br john ford seems to think of this film as an epic and at the time of its release it probably was but even then there's just not enough material to present it as such br br it's a nice watch but not a classic
<START> the idea's which are shown in this film are with a lot of care and detail and depict what a lot of people from around the world think of the american policies not neccessarily the united states itself it shows what most of the people around the world think about america and what the americans dont know about themselves 11 directors showing 11 amazing minutes each of something which will give us viewers a lot to think about when they go home after watching the movie
<START> steven what have you done you have hit an all new low it is weird since steven's last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it wasn't even funny steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway as for the action well let's just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege 1 and 2 and exit wounds the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesn't make scenes sometimes flight of fury better be good what a shame i wasted 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time
<START> warning spoilers following superb recreation of the base in antarctica where the real events of the film took place other than that libelous scandalous filmed in canada presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical revisionist propaganda it is and starring susan sarandon of all people i can only assume that canadian born director roger spottiswoode was coerced to make the usaf the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in calgary kenn borek air
<START> i am a kung fu fan but not a woo fan i have no interest in gangster movies filled with over the top gun play now martial arts that's beautiful and john woo surprised me here by producing a highly entertaining kung fu movie which almost has too much fighting if such a thing is possible this is good stuff br br many of the fight scenes are very good and some of them are less good and the main characters are amusing and likable the bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil but entertaining none the less you gotta see the sleeping wizard he can only fight when he's asleep it's hysterical br br upon repeated viewings however last hurrah for chivalry can tend to get a little boring and long winded also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good hence i rate it only a 7 out of 10 but it really is almost an 8 br br all in all one of the better kung fu movies made smack dab in the heart of kung fu cinema's prime all the really good kung fu movies are from the mid to late 1970ies with some notable exceptions from the late '60ies and early '70ies and early '80ies to be fair
<START> this animated feature a co production between ireland belgium and france deals with what is surely one of the oddest subject ever for a movie the creation in the 9th century of a famous illuminated manuscript the book of kells in this fantastic retelling of that story a prepubescent boy named brendan living in a monastery ruled by his uncle a stern abbot who is worried preparing the defenses of the abbey from the impending attack by the feared vikings must get into the forbidding surrounding forest to find the materials that a master illuminator named aidan needs to finish the book to do that task in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named aisling gorgeously and delicately drawn by hand there is some computer animation in a few key passages in a manner that wants to resemble both medieval and traditional celtic art and with a very creative use of color and all sorts of geometric shapes this film is relentlessly strange but is a good strange not of the off putting variety but of the eye opening sort if one were to nitpick beyond some anachronisms like an african monk in 9th century ireland Â one would have to say that the blend of catholic mysticism with celtic paganism in this movie never really coalesce and the comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad that's why i cannot give them the highest ranking but these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and superbly imaginative film
<START> yes people are racist people are even racist in college that's a good point and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films what sets higher learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most ham fisted and predictable way possible oh yeah it's in college too br br this film deals with this problem of racism the way frankenstein deals with most problems it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner most of the characters are cartoonish one dimensional caricatures lesbian feminist angry black man that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them the angry black men feel cheated feminists hate men etc one feminist even holds a sign that reads dead men don't rape see what i mean i don't want to give anything away but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist they'll probably behave exactly how you expect them to the changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie the big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neo nazis will act like violent neo nazis i'll guess you'll just have to watch to find out what happens br br another problem i have with this movie is that it's supposed to be gritty and hard hitting but they make nazis the bad guys i agree nazis are evil but that's my point everybody thinks nazis are bad we're not breaking any new ground here nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930's the film doesn't challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements it just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy after school special like manner being anti rape anti racist and anti nazi isn't exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue br br higher learning is predictable cartoonish and in a word stupid avoid at all costs
<START> holes the novel was forced on me in an education course i didn't think i would like a children's novel plus the other couple of books i was forced to read for the class were really bad but to my surprise i absolutely loved holes it really is one of the most perfectly written novels i've ever read i think it has the rare quality that makes it appeal to pre teens teenagers and adults everyone who reads it i think will walk away a better person while i can't quite say that for the film i am happy to say that they got it mostly right i don't think viewers of the film will walk away as enriched but they will certainly be entertained without the side effect of being stupider when they sat down it is an intelligent story and it's very well told i think it moves a tad too quickly the novel takes more time in developing the characters and the flashbacks come in and out so quickly that they don't have too much time to register the interracial romance in the past feels more clichÃ© and trite than it does in the novel and the ending which ties together all the loose threads seems very ridiculous it's exactly the same in the novel but there's a sense of the absurd that doesn't quite exist in the film it works a lot better i also don't like the multitude of pop songs i wish disney didn't feel it such a necessity to sell soundtracks the cast is across the board excellent from the young kids to the old pros jon voight is especially great not quite sure why we need catwoman and the fonze though 9 10
<START> surely one of the most ill advised remakes of a classic in film history â especially since the promise of its tag line âthe most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all timeâ isnât even properly exploited although this film was regularly shown on tv in my neck of the woods since my childhood days its notoriety for awfulness not erotic content mind you kept me away from it until now â and i only relented because i have recently enjoyed bo derekâs previous film 10 1979 and have been watching a lot of fantasy stuff as well over the christmas period br br lead actress producer bo derek is rather ridiculous playing the schoolgirl ish sexual innocent witness the inept banana scene and as was to be expected she is made to get her clothes off a few times but as welcome as these scenes were she came off as far more sensual in 10 than she does here richard harris then chews the scenery incessantly as janeâs obsessed explorer father but john philip law barely registers as his aide who meekly shows some initial interest in jane herself newcomer miles oâkeeffe has the title role and he only makes his entrance 45 minutes into the movie is completely silent throughout except for his famous yodel which is probably lifted from johnny weissmuller anyway and furthermore is as inexpressive as one of the trees he dangles from at regular intervals throughout the filmâs second half for the record he later starred in two ator movies or would be conan imitators for joe dâamato and the king arthur era set sword of the valiant 1984 br br when still an actor director john derek who also serves as his own cinematographer here had worked with some good film makers cecil b de mille william dieterle and robert rossen and a few great ones otto preminger nicholas ray and don siegel but he clearly learned zilch from them as his direction of this one is a major liability appallingly pretentious at times witness the perfectly horrid python attack sequence with a senseless overuse of the slow motion technique and cheesy transitions this was derekâs seventh film as a director and his second of four with wife bo and eventually he would only get to make two more br br the filmâs utter failure only needs to be gauged by the fact that the tarzan legend was tackled once more on film â in greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes which surprisingly enough i havenât watched myself yet â a mere three years later nominated for six razzie awards including john derek richard harris and miles oâkeeffe and winning one for bo derek herself tarzan the ape man was co written by gary goddard the future director of another highly anticipated but ultimately disappointing transposition to the silver screen of a this time animated heroic figure master of the universe 1987 which i will be revisiting presently as well yay despite a charming closing credit sequence showing tarzan and jane playing with around with an orang utan and a music score that is not half bad actually and quite rousing on occasion any belated good intentions are defeated by an extremely silly climax involving natives painting bo completely white and fatally john derekâs clear disinterest in the character of tarzan himself which makes him come off as an unimportant supporting character in his own self titled movie
