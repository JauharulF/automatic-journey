<START> it seems to me as a recent film school graduate that in these times of new zealand film reaching new heights the general public seems to think every new zealand film made is great sione's wedding proves this is dead wrong br br it's completely overrated and not funny and far from the 'hilarious' film other users of imdb have commented the only really funny thing i found in this film was derek the wannabe black guy but other than that the jokes were recycled crap that we'd all heard before br br being of half samoan decent i wanted to see how the film was going to deal with polynesian representation it was a complete balls up i know it's a supposed comedy but i didn't feel like the characters had anything new to say about polynesian identity even if it was in a tongue in cheek manner i was most disappointed with the ending of the film and the resolution of the character's relationships mikaele was the player who only messed around with white women comes to slightly turn his ways when the 'dusky maiden' comes to town has an epiphany that maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship then at the very last minute rejects it and accepts his position as a polynesian playboy for palagi women i didn't understand why they did this br br all in all it was very disappointing my whole family went to see it expecting to have a good laugh but ended up being really bitter about paying to see it at the cinema the jokes are lame at best the acting particularly of sefa's girlfriend appalling and honestly i would've been happy if i had got my hands on one of those pirated copies of the film to save myself the 15 ticket price br br i think the only good thing to come from the movie is that it's the second step behind no 2 of course a far superior film to this one in the birth of polynesian cinema i hope pacific filmmakers in the future can learn from sione's wedding in how to not reflect polynesia and have something more meaningful and sensible to say even if it is done in a comedic fashion
<START> this version moved a little slow for my taste and i suppose i have problems with this play to begin with but first the movie it's a typical tv movie version of a play which means it doesn't have the flair of the original film version with william holden what they couldn't afford to hire more than twelve people as extras why move the movie up to 1966 so you could give the little sister a line about the vietnam war protests why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement br br as for the casting some hits some misses jay o sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with josh brolin brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes he's believable as an ex bmoc jock but he doesn't have the raw sensuality of william holden i always thought brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him pardon the pun gretchen moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played she didn't project the innocence or ignorance that the character required maybe it's because she and brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be but then again holden was ten years too old bonnie bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and mary steenburgen can't seem to make up her mind whether she was playing blanche dubois or katharine from the taming of the shrew br br as for mr inge's play i always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue the twilight zone i believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode spur of the moment where a young diana hyland was being chased by a bitter older diana hyland because the younger diana hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to hal carter
<START> slither is a horror comedy that doesn't really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other it has one scene that is exceptionally good any number of zingers that work but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie in addition the script does not focus on the hero and heroine and goes off kilter in several places br br a major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero fillion to follow grant grant michael rooker as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster this whole part of the film drags michael rooker's character isn't that interesting to us as a person and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monster's interest might be interesting if this was grant portrait of a man turning into a monster rather than a horror comedy alien invasion movie in the final analysis this movie's problems are in the script it isn't that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates the purpose of a horror comedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens instead we get an exploration of the alien's habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag the ostensible heroine elizabeth banks as starla grant is more central to this part but nonetheless i felt the movie had left its narrative track unless it planned on following grant grant all the way to the end br br when fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook but once again the problem is in the script by this point that audience knows and the characters should know that grant is not just suffering from some disease and act accordingly shotguns instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that let us get you to a hospital is going to help although their reactions might have been human and real these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised delivered action a lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing br br spoilers ahead after the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie the script once again betrays the movie at this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien the writer director gunn chooses as this character a completely new character rather than one of already developed minor characters why why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot by the time this character is attacked we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath had gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters he could have completely avoided introducing her family and saved time and money furthermore the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the alien's plans without all the additional characters and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigor br br my last criticism is based on the movie's look gunn is primarily a writer or maybe it was budgetary constraints but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field and the screen simply looks drab the sets in wheelsy the fictional town where the action takes place look cheap the whole movie looks cheap box office mojo states the films' budget was 15 million newspapers say 29 million and considering they didn't use any name talent i would say the money did not show up on screen the monster is just repulsive and rarely looks deadly br br the last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the character's actions by the time fillion and co have begun hunting grant the alien one woman has disappeared and grant is known to have been mutilating animals at this point i was expecting the fbi or at least the state police to show up and take over from the hick sheriff a woman has disappeared and likely been murdered and a local has been acting psychotic time to call the authorities but basically i was hoping that would happen because i just wanted some characters who would show up and act br br although this movie is ostensibly a horror comedy the movie it bears the most resemblance to is dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions whereas dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story especially the entire morgan freeman subplot and particularly the ending in many ways it was stronger primarily because the main characters were stronger but more importantly because it looked beautiful although that may be anathema preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values that just shows you how uninteresting i found the look of slither
<START> the color purple is truly amazing there is none like it and i don't think there ever will be it's a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer takes on the actors are flawless and the directing is superb i absolutely loved it a movie has never made me so happy it is beautiful that's the best way to explain it
<START> many king fans hate this because it departed from the book but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump that notwithstanding the movie does fail completely but it fails entirely on film terms i'd like to smack the people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made i always follow up with the question really exactly what scene scared you every fan i've asked goes silent occasionally someone at a loss for a decent scare there are none names the grape juice shooting out of elevators shtick if you're afraid of that i don't know what to tell you except maybe that you're easily scared i just rolled my eyes watching these z grade horror ideas play out in this schlocky incoherent movie br br one place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get mr halloran up to the overlook only to kill him with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes halloran forever to walk down really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film br br oh and nice choice for mr halloran's artwork stanley black light afro nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie has there ever been a more off out of place shot in any movie ever made br br i consider it a miracle that i was eventually able to bypass this turd and agree that kubricks 2001 is a truly important film given the immense 'bad will' generated by both this stupid stupid movie and the cult of fawning but inarticulate kubrick fan boys who couldn't describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the library of congress in front of them br br toss in the grotesque overacting of jack nicholson the introduction of dumb one liners at tense moments and the razzie nominated performance of shelly duvall and you have a very crappy movie
<START> what a stunning episode for this fine series this is television excellence at its best the story takes place in 1968 and it's beautifully filmed in black white almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images this is a story about two men who fall in love but i don't want to spoil this it is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in america written by the superb tom pettit and directed by the great jeannot szwarc we move through their lives their love for each other and their tragedy taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters chills ran up my spine at the end when they played bob dylan's gorgeous ah but i was so much older then i'm younger than that now as sung by the byrds this one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars beautiful
<START> so your bairns are away on a sleep over the wife is visiting the mother in law you though are at home it's a dark and stormy night and there is no football on the telly and the dishwasher needs stacking so now what are you going to do br br i will tell you br br go make an old fashioned cocoa frys is best get hold of some ginger nuts and sit down in front of the dvd now go select and play arthur askeys world war two thriller horror the ghost train return to that comfortable settee and enjoy the night in br br the ghost train is a genuine british war time classic arthur askey with his side kick stinker murdoch entertain you and i suspect the cast to a high octane thrills and spills espionage thriller it's set in old rural england during the second world war br br it centres around a motley group of people that need to stay overnight through circumstances outside any ones' control in an old railway waiting room that they discover is haunted by an old train br br the plot unfolds neatly and precisely and is a credit to the entire cast it is humorous in parts and at times genuinely scary br br the tale was written by that old boy godfrey of dads army fame and it is clever br br arthur askey is entertaining and is very at home preforming his routines to you and the cast he also shows he can act a bit the cast are never out staged though even the railway porter and the parrot help give the film the necessary gravitas br br oh and when it ends please remember to stack the dish washer
<START> yes i was lucky enough to see the long running original production of michael bennett's hit musical it was an amazing experience and i paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985 it is awful almost everything fails first off attenborough a fine actor a good director with the right material is a sorry choice almost as bad as when john huston was hired to mangle annie the camera is always in the wrong place they chop up the songs and the casting they are awful the power of the play was these dancers these hungry talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance you couldn't take your eyes off of them but this cast just gets by dancing does a nice job singing but none of them spark one bit in fact look up the cast on imdb none of them really went on to do anything much ok ok janet jones married gretzky sheesh so this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic the desperation the passion of the stage musical a total strike out but even though they try to smother the music the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was
<START> a classic hollywood biopic is the best sense of the genre gooding and deniro both give spectacularly heartfelt performances in the two leads roles and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent with standout performances by carl lumbly and michael rapoport br br the only nit i might pick is that theron's role was unnecessary distracting not her performance which was fine it's just that the film seemed to add two unnecessary scenes to accommodate her role br br aside from that the characterizations dynamics and action of the real life story are riveting and unforgettable the evolutions of the main characters and how what they experience evolves their beings are uniquely characterized by the performing artists despite the movie's extreme length the pacing stays intact throughout the score is also terrific br br us this a predictable hollywood film you bet so mike leigh addicts should subtract a star but everyone else should enjoy mightily
<START> this movie had a imdb rating of 8 1 so i expected much more from it it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous but before the movie is half way through it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie but we get to know them a little too well they become caricatures not real people at all this is the same story i've seen hundreds of times only told here with slightly different circumstances the thing is i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale br br the only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon
<START> if you see this turkey listed in your tv guide avoid it like the plague br br a steaming great pile of fetid dingoes kidneys doesn't begin to describe how bad this movie is there is only one funny scene the memory eraser scene but even that rates only 001 on the laughometer out of 1000 whoever wrote this turkey should be banned from writing another movie for their entire lives
<START> the movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred melissa joan hart and daniel baldwin br br the main protagonist antagonist jennifer stanton hart is a typical all american teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father baldwin however when she meets an ex con called nick ryan jeremy jordan never been kissed they instantly 'fall' for each other but jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship she manipulates him to kill her parents to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with brad david lascher future 'sabrina' cast mate for hart melissa joan hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and nick so she can literally get away with murder the rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time i also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year hart began portrayed sabrina the teenage witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television br br although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to 'nine dead' that comes out in november because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called clarissa darling or sabrina spellman br br i recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of melissa joan hart or sabrina you can watch this on the internet so i suggest check it out
<START> romance is in the air and love is in bloom in victorian era england in this light hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue the ladies were charming and elegant and the gentlemen dashing emma ' based on the novel by jane austen and written for the screen and directed by douglas mcgrath stars the lovely gwyneth paltrow in the title role a self appointed matchmaker emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend harriet toni collette but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying meanwhile her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome mr knightley jeremy northam whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than emma's and lend some needed balance to the proceedings and emma so concerned with what is right for others neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all her own the world goes Âround and love abounds but emma is about to miss the boat luckily for her however the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings now if she can but stop long enough to realize it but as everyone who has known true love knows matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant depending upon the slightest thing and while romance is at hand for emma she must first recognize it and seize the moment br br mcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful feel good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world there may be an air of frivolity about it but in retrospect this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is in all honesty to just about anyone love and with mcgrath's impeccable sense of pace and timing it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable it's a pleasant affecting film with a wonderful cast that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place it's light fare but absorbing and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow br br the winsome paltrow who won the oscar for best actress for shakespeare in love' two years after making this one seems comfortable and right at home in this genre she personifies all things british and does it with such naturalness and facility that it's the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether she's simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner very reminiscent of audrey hepburn yet paltrow is unique as an actor she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated with such films as hard eight ' hush' and a perfect murder' that she can play just about any part effectively and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own but it's with characters like emma that she really shines she is so expressive and open and her personality is so engaging that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch regardless of the part she is playing and for emma she is absolutely perfect br br jeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley and like paltrow seems suited to the genre in the right role that is his performance in the more recent the golden bowl ' in which he played an italian prince was less than satisfying here however he is perfect he is handsome and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real like colin firth's mr darcy in the miniseries pride and prejudice ' northam has created a memorable character with his own mr knightley br br also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette as emma's friend harriet smith and alan cumming as the reverend elton respectively collette and cumming create characters who are very real people and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film and it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema and to films of any genre br br the supporting cast includes greta scacchi mrs weston denys hawthorne mr woodhouse sophie thompson miss bates kathleen byron mrs goddard phyllida law mrs bates polly walker jane fairfax and ewan mcgregor frank churchill an uplifting elegant film emma' is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness and even if it's only through the magic of the silver screen it's nice to be able to escape to such a world as this if only for a couple of hours as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit and that's the magic of the movies i rate this one 9 10 br br br br
<START> it starts slowly showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april but don't give up on it nothing much happens but the time passes exquisitely and there are numerous sly jokes my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm which i find hilarious the movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word the scenery is beautiful as is polly walker and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying br br the movie takes a couple of liberties with the book the biggest being with the arbuthnot briggs dester business but i actually preferred the movie's version of this it may be more sentimental but i felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story and anyway i like sentiment when it's well done br br an excellent movie especially as a date movie during lousy weather
<START> i recently saw the broadway revival of blithe spirit starring angela lansbury rupert everett christine ebersole and jayne atkinson it's a terrific production and shows what good actors can do with a play that is less than perfect angela lansbury is extremely funny as madame arcati br br it was probably a mistake then to check out the film version of the play starring rex harrison the movie does not have the energy or the laughs of a good stage production br br blithe spirit is probably one of those plays that works better with a live cast in an audience full of people who have come to laugh the actors can improvise give touches and nuances to their performance and delivery of the lines and involve the audience on a personal level that you can't get in a movie house or with a dvd showing where the audience is separated from the story by the fourth wall the story charles condomine rex harrison a successful writer lives with his wife ruth constance cummings in a house in the english countryside seeking information for his next book a book dealing with the supernatural charles invites madame arcati margaret rutherford reprising her role from the original 1941 london production a local spiritual medium over to his house to conduct a sÃ©ance charles believes that spiritism is a sham but hopes to pick up the tricks of the trade but then madame arcati brings back the ghost of elvira kaye hammond charles's first wife who died of pneumonia seven years ago elvira refuses to leave and develops a spitting rivalry with ruth over charles complicated by the fact that only charles can see or hear elvira br br on stage the actors can give performances that invite laughs in this situation but on the screen the actors in blithe spirit tear through the lines as if they don't know that anyone is listening to them they mumble lines that were designed to get laughs on the stage the performances by harrison cummings and even kaye hammond are flat and lifeless only margaret rutherford seems to have retained her spark and humor as madame arcati br br the oscar winning visual effects in the film are unimpressive not just by today's standards but by the standards of 1946 they consist mostly of kaye hammond walking around in fluorescent green outfits and makeup being photographed in special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost br br the cinematographer deserves some credit for creative lighting but compare the dull visual effects of blithe spirit to the truly groundbreaking effects in disney's song of the south which was eligible for awards the same year in south humans and animated characters share the screen seamlessly for minutes at a time compared to south the oscar that blithe spirit received for special effects was completely undeserved br br at any rate i can only encourage you to catch the broadway revival of this play with angela lansbury before it closes as for the movie with rex harrison skip it
<START> this is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in effected by or suffering from an eating disorder it is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl its causes and its symptoms the girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in cinema today alison lohman who was later so spectacular in 'where the truth lies' i would recommend that this film be shown in all schools as you will never see a better on this subject alison lohman is absolutely outstanding and one marvels at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder if barometers tell us the air pressure alison lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy her emotional range is so precise each scene could be measured microscopically for its gradations of trauma on a scale of rising hysteria and desperation which reaches unbearable intensity mare winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions just as finely tuned as lohman's together they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with one another this film is really an astonishing achievement and director katt shea should be proud of it the only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people but even if you like nature films best this is after all animal behaviour at the sharp edge bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy her own body in a frenzy of despair and if we don't sympathise with people suffering from the depths of despair then we are dead inside
<START> the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it keeping his great 30 days tv series in mind but also counting in his mtv production i bet you will that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production supersize me i did not had my hopes up high sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less as with supersize me after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and re repeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end
<START> this is one fine movie i can watch it any time rauol julia gave an outstanding performance we lost him too soon richard dryfus is a great talent only thing it needed more of was dana delany what a babe
<START> i was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in north carolina instead i watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the duke family and this went on and on if mr mcelwee's family had prevailed over the dukes i doubt that mr mcelwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco related diseases i grew up near the area where mr mcelwee's family began it tobacco business i expected more than mcewee's continual focus on his family i learned very little about the history of tobacco in the nc economy and the ramifications to the state's economy by tighter regulation of tobacco the countless references to the movie bright leaves are out of place so what if gary cooper played mr mcelwee's great grandfather does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the north carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film i didn't
<START> a fey story of a martian attempt to colonize earth things must be pretty bad back on mars two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported ufo crash whatever landed is buried under the ice at tracy's pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner br br the diner has had no customers since eleven o'clock that morning now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge the bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus although he didn't notice who they were the problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to be resumed one of them is an alien but which one all of them are suspect there's the crazy old man jack elam of course who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit there's a blustering businessman who must get to boston john hoyt a young couple on their honeymoon execrable performance by the husband ron kipling except for the couples nobody has noticed anyone else and even the couples are suspicious of each other bride to newly minted husband i could have sworn you had a mole on your chin the story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way the phone rings for no reason the lights go on and off the juke box turns itself on and none of it is to be taken seriously br br it's a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle there is no discernible depth to it it's not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens it's not a warning of any kind just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses br br i always enjoy it when it's on it's especially interesting to see john hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman knowing that in 1954 he was the roman senator who masterminded the assassination of julius caesar in mgm's version of shakespeare's play and here he is with three arms br br oops
