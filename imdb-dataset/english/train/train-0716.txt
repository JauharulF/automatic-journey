<START> during the first 3 seasons fairly odd parents was as tasty as hard candy bright and sweet and addictive now it's as tasty as pepto bismol and unfortunately pepto bismol is what you'll need after viewing the more recent episodes where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence resulting in no laughs cosmo once one of the more endearing nick characters has devolved into an abusive unfunny cretin that the cast of family guy wouldn't even want to know timmy has become a selfish arrogant jerkwad that bart simpson would happily beat the snot out of and given timmy's snottiness that would take a lot of beating and poor wanda a real charmer who's become the victim of her husband and godchild she's now labeled a nag for caring about the well being of others plus cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else but he's never punished for it nor does he learn any lessons which pretty much sums up butch hartman's attitude towards kids they're crude vulgar and not too bright thank god this crummy toon has been cancelled along with butch hartman's darling danny phantom at least butch got what he deserved unlike cosmo
<START> legend of zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years it transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art with unmatched visual sceneries and story of divine proportions legend of zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its majesty this movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life the acting is perfect for this type of movie if you were an immortal with supernatural powers i would think you'd keep more to yourself br br unlike the comments of many the plot is actually quite easy to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not be paying attention since or are used to such levels of sophistication as the titanic the plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air legend of zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur allow yourself to be completely engulfed within its fantastical vision and you will grow to love this movie
<START> i watched this movie by chance get curious by the trailer on tv i like when i discover movies like this little tender stories about ordinary people even if the end is tragic the man in the moon has some funny moments especially in the first characterization of dani with her innocent and pure love affair with court it's really a beautiful moving love story with 3 high points the performance of reese witherspoon who maintained her promises in the world of cinema the beautiful cinematography by the old lion freddie francis and the fantastic score by james newton howard which is really the soul of the movie his themes which deserved an oscar nomination are so intimate and lyric that it seems they had transformed the screenplay in music
<START> another aussie masterpiece this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural and it does very well it doesn't resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks it focuses more on emotional impact a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney co bring to life it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago strange things begin to happen in the house and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared who was actually a mass murderer highly recommended 8 10
<START> it is no wonder this movie won 4 prices it is a movie that lingers to any soul it isn't a wonder why it took paul reiser 20 years to finally give in and talk to peter falk about his idea i can understand every part of it this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear or thousands br br story 10 10 when sam kleinman gets a letter from his wife about her leaving him to find something else his son and him take out on a road trip to find her and while they do that they find something lost friendship family and affection for each other at the beginning you know whats going to happen but none soever the story is not that easy to figure out from beginning to end it is a ride between a father and his son and a husband and his wife it is no wonder it took paul reiser 20 years to write this beautiful romance comedy br br actors 10 10 well you cant say anything else that what i about to say hey it is with peter falk in it he is a legend everything he does in movies are magic when you use peter falk in a romance comedy what do you think you get a perfect outcome it is no wonder this movie is that perfect and won that many prices as the son paul reiser does an excellent job although he isn't a great actor always that doesn't mean that this didn't work actually peter falk and paul reiser plays the perfect father and son the rest of the cast is good enough but you don't see them as much so just say they do what they shall to get this to shine even more br br music 10 10 it doesn't always work when using music sometimes it just doesn't fit but that is not the thing in this movie the music is perfect in tune it makes the movie even more compelling this part of the movie will shine off as good as the other parts a great soundtrack for a romance comedy thats for sure br br overall 10 10 there are so many romance comedy movies out on tapes dvds blu ray and what not but this movie is one of the special ones it doesn't happen everyday that you can create a story like this it takes years thinking about this and the fact is that actually what it took to make it a great piece that should be bought and kept into the human soul see it when you get old and see it with your father at a old age i think then this movie will spark like no other ever made
<START> i don't know what the rest of you guys watch steven seagal movies for but i watch them because as silly as they are they're at least always good for a laugh why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of br br attack force is by no means a great movie but i felt it was as worthy a steven seagal vehicle as many of his other movies in fact i didn't think it was one of his worst by a long shot it had most of the time a half way coherent plot line and it was most of the time fundamentally exciting the ending really sucked but even that had some enjoyably trashy elements in the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised but i actually thought that the acting characterization if i may use such a big word and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true steven seagal fan would expect seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone faced no nonsense man's man that we've come to expect and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well without ever up staging him this people is what a steven seagal movie does deal with it or even better laugh at it br br 4 out of 10
<START> i haven't written a review on imdb for the longest time however i felt myself compelled to write this when looking up this movie i found one particular review which urged people not to see this film do not pay any attention to this ignorant person nothing is a fantastic film full of laughs and above all imagination aren't you sick and tired of being force fed the same old cycle of bubble gum trash movies sometimes a film like nothing comes along and gives you something you have never seen before i don't even care if you dislike even hate the movie but no one has a right to discredit the film imdb has a monumental impact on reputations and no negative review should discredit the film like that just say you hate it and why you hate it but don't try to tell people that they shouldn't watch it we have minds of our own and will make up our own minds thank you br br if my judgment is any good i'd say that more people will enjoy this movie as opposed to those who hate it br br treat your mind to a bit of eye candy see nothing
<START> who can watch a movie look at lucy liu and not be overjoyed that woman is amazingly beautiful a talented actress that's a tough combination to find now a days and jeremy northam i heard his name plenty of times but i never really noticed him my advice to hollywood is use him more br br now about the movie i watched it in one of my graveyard shift i don't recommend that to anyone it's a bit to complicated mysterious for that i still can't believe i didn't see the ending coming i'm not gonna say what cause that'll spoil the hole movie although saying this is spoilment enough br br now i'm suppose to cast my vote about this movie i love the dark mystic story the actors did a good job i love the directors natali work in the past there's not a big audience for this kind of thing that's also pretty risky you know what i'm just gonna give this work a 8 cause everybody should see this then again 1 point deduction cause there is always space for improvement
<START> despite the title the sword bearer and the dvd cover action herioc poses of the sword bearer this is not a super hero film br br minor spoilers it follows the tale of sasha the sword bearer who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm cool you say but no this is real life if you had this power as a child could you control it when say faced by a mad man or when your mum's boyfriend is beating her and if you don't control it how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12 br br this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him wandering aimlessly after another killing much like a bout de soufflÃ© he then meet katya and the pair fall instantly in love providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways however his past is still chasing him in the form of two police officers br br that is essentially the story and there is virtually no action on screen though a lot if suggested br br i really like this movie unlike many hollywood 'super hero' films we get very little back story there is no bad guy unless you count the sword bearer himself abut there is a lot of heart and good character development br br worth checking out if you can find it
<START> as usual hollywood stereotyped everyone in the movie but this one is a classic from the uptight white collar banker to the russian woman well done even facial expressions were great language was perfect even in russian language and nicole did a splendid job hey guys you get what you pay for
<START> i saw it i agree with him 100 but i didn't care for his delivery he just came off as an asshole in a poorly edited contrived juvenile smear campaign edit cuts galore etc the camera would be focused on him and you'd see 2 or 3 edit cuts just over the course of a minute or two of dialog add in the constant boom mikes in the camera shot which is a film no no br br this documentary hits a topic with so many angles so many interesting stories that the movie is just so easily done picking on religious fanatics is like picking on the retarded kid it is so easy it is just wrong i mean how hard is it to make these people look like nut bags to make them contradict themselves you just let them recite more then a verse or two i do like when he jumped back in forth between people of the same religion and showed them completely contradicting themselves br br i just think he could have done something a little more creative the part with the neurologist talking about brain activity was never fleshed out it could have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious fits compared to drugs or sex or he could have played more on the women all rejoicing over the passion play that looked more like a snuff scene in a new rob zombie movie more could have gone into the history of john smith the mormon founder who had quite the colorful past delve into science v s religion one is a very methodical very strict process for increasing the confidence in theories it builds on itself from a solid bottom up a new layer on top of a more proved layer an enormous burden of proof is required each step of the way the other starts at the top and comes down with unchallengeable claims it is so because wellÂ i said so br br done rightÂ i'd say turn it into an hbo original seriesÂ hit a different religion every week br br it was an eye opener about one thing i must have been blind good ole g w bush no wonder he got elected he had the religious majority and well now that is the blind leading the blind br br bill moyer well what can i expect from a guy who hands out at sutra in newport beach
<START> i bought this movie for 5 at a used cd store and i kinda regret it i'll start by saying i'm a huge fan of cheesy horror flicks they provide a horribly tacky cheap entertainment this movie entertained for the first half hour because it was so bad it could be made fun of in an mst3k style manner quite easily then it got boring br br the acting is the scariest part of the movie while great acting is not to be expected this was laughably bad and honestly provided all of the entertainment that was to be had this is the plus side to the movie where the movie really falters in entertaining is the writing lighting and the editing br br this movie provides way too many what the is going on moments there are many moments such as the mother having strange fits at dinner and then that having absolutely no consequence in the movie along the lines of dinner someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eat refined food for five minutes straight without dialogue every time a meal was served during the meals and other inappropriate moments the scene cuts away to pure darkness outside then cuts back in and speaking of darkness outside one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate where apparently it isn't nighttime unless it's raining and speaking of darkness a big problem with the movie is that it's so poorly lit you can't see what's going on half the time which is more of a frustration than anything in one of the climactic scenes you can't even tell what you're supposed to be seeing that's so shocking br br and when it comes to climactic scenes unhinged contains one of the worst i've seen people say wow that surprised me and that's good i can say that the big reveal did surprise me because i didn't see it coming the reason i didn't see it coming is because it made absolutely no sense i won't ruin it for you but i will tell you that my friend and i spent a good twenty minutes rewinding to various parts of the movie to find anything that would have validated that at all and all we found were more things saying that it wasn't possible br br all in all this movie is actually better when you watch it with the commentary tracks that make fun of it i love crap horror movies but this was too much
<START> a slow tedious and one dimensional movie good casting with clichÃ©d dialogue boring story line and soulless direction from mr marshal the conventional and predictable story of the most famous form of prostitution from the asian continent lacks heart new insights and depth the lead character looks out of place due to her tiny phisique and phony looking contact lenses the lexicon employed by the geishas sounds forced and a bit too sophisticated for their limited exposure in the ways of education the story goes on and on for hours trying to convince you this little boring flat chested asian girl is the ultimate geisha they actually say in the movie she is destined to become a legend i say hardy the case the movie is just plain boring it is beautiful to look at it has a very few interesting moments as many as you may find by going out for cigarretes basically if you don't believe the messenger you wont believe the message and this girl didn't fill the shoe borin boring skip it
<START> i've loved all of cream's work even as there is such a small and precious catalog of work to take hold even when they go for as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs spoonful and toad off of wheels of fire are prime examples still rock the socks off of more than half of any given rock act working today this power to gel on stage is given one of the most anticipate rock band reunions ever with their royal albert hall shows last year they may have gotten older as have their fans but the energy is still there with the great arrangements of classic blues songs as well as their own the renditions of white room badge politician spoonful sunshine of your love not one seems to miss a beat clapton's solos have a formation that he sometimes doesn't have when on stage with his solo band ginger baker enough said jack bruce is sturdy enough with his vocals still with a kind of power that clapton could never get on his own bottom line if you want to see what were the best shows you wish you had seen last year well some may have seen them it's all on this dvd with cool special features
<START> photography was too jumpy to follow dark scenes hard to see br br had good story line too bad it got lost somewhere too noisy for what was really happening bottom line is it's a baddddd movie
<START> i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work finally found it yesterday 2 13 02 on lifetime movie channel br br jim larson's comments about it being a sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths were dead on writers probably shouldn't get a bonus everyone else sro for making the movie br br anybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see it br br natasha's screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric to say nothing of her beauty that anything she is in goes on my favorite list her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for br br god bless her her family and future endeavors br br this movie doesn't seem to available in dvd or video yet but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too
<START> this kind of film has become old hat by now hasn't it the whole thing is syrupy nostalgia turned in upon itself in some kind of feedback loop br br it sure sounds like a good idea a great ensemble cast some good gags and some human drama about what could have might have been unfortunately there is no central event that binds them all together like there was in the big chill one of those seminal movies that spawned copycat films like this one you end up wanting to see more of one or two particular people instead of getting short takes on everyone the superficiality this creates is not just annoying it's maddening the below average script doesn't help
<START> lorenzo lamas stars as some type of cia agent who captures some exotic beauty named alexa kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers o j simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble i must admit i'm not a fan of lorenzo lamas or his movies he stinks however when compared to o j simpson and lamas' comatose wife kinmont lamas seems like ah jean claude van damme i only saw cia because of the renewed interest around the o j simpson trial you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels you couldn't escape this movie in 1994 you could go to an amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable tv the movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of o j simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor also where was bobby knight and kobe bryant to make this a complete camp classic br br out of 4 bad
<START> 54 is a film based on the infamous studio 54 of the 1970s the hangout for the social elite and party clubbers in the film ryan phillippe is the main character based on an actual employee of studio from 1977 1982 br br the film's problem is that it's all glitter and style and no substance it tries to be a really grimy and probing satire like boogie nights but ultimately comes across as an inferior wannabe mike myers is given the thankless task of playing cocaine snorting club owner steve rubell it's only a slightly comedic role and if this was myers' best attempts at sliding into drama like lemmon and other comedic actors did in their time it's a total failure br br 54 could have been insightful and interesting but instead it's just another dumb teen flick that isn't entertaining or even remotely engaging view at your own peril
<START> noni hazlehurst's tour de force performance which won her an afi award is at least on par with her effort in fran three years later colin friels is also good and for those who are interested alice garner appears as noni's child and michael caton best known for the castle is a bearded painter also interestingly hazlehurst is currently the host of lifestyle program better homes and gardens and caton is the host of property type programs including hot property hot auction etc this film reaffirms the popularly held belief that noni was arguably australia's top female actor during the early to mid 1980s rating 79 100
