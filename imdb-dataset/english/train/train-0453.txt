<START> the movie began well enough it had a fellow get hit by a glowing green meteorite getting superpowers telekinesis x ray vision invulnerability flight the ability to speak to dogs superspeed heat vision and the ability to make plants grow large and quickly and fighting crime from there on it's all downhill br br meteor man gets a costume from his mom fights with the resident gangs and has many aborted encounters with the gang leaders which serves to set you up for the disappointing overlong and stupefying ending br br it wouldn't be so remarkably bad if it weren't like watching a boxing match where the two fighters pretend to hit each other while the audience stands looking onward while the fighters just continue to dance br br despite all of this nonsense the movie has good points it states clearly that if you try to take on a gang alone then they'll come back to your home and hurt you it states that gangs communities need to see their real enemies the big bosses that use them for their own ends to crush honest people into a ghetto existence it also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community do destroy the predators that harm them the only message it really lacks is that the voters should ensure their elected officials rudolph giuliani marion barry ronald reagan george w bush george h w bush aren't crooks too br br
<START> first of all write the script on a napkin who needs more than that after all we're not a hollywood film br br then get amateur actors it will be good for the festival hype after all who needs people who have spent years honing their craft then hire a cinematographer who doesn't know how to light you see if it's well lit it won't look real and the festival people won't like it who needs to have professional level photography anyway then hire a ten year old who has never held a camera to be your operator it will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for reality and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people critics and a small sliver of the audience who over intellectualize will scream genius because they won't believe this was just complete amateur hour br br once you've done that buy your ticket to the festival of bad movies aka sundance br br what a sad waste
<START> this is the definite lars von trier movie my favorite i rank it higher than breaking the waves or the latest dancer in the dark i simply love the beauty of the picture the framing is so original acting is wonderful a must see
<START> do you know when you look at your collection of old videotaped movies and realize that there are some that you've only seen once or twice and you can't remember if they're worth the time it takes to see them the alibi is was one of those films i found it not long ago and decided i might as well give it a chance i'm not entirely sure if i'm happy with my decision on one hand the film is really really bad on the other now i have another free tape yeah you get it the plot is predictable and not in any way original the pacing is bad the acting is bad but that's not really surprising seeing as the two leads are former soap opera stars they're used to overact the characters are poorly written clichÃ©s the film even manages to screw up the easiest damn way to impress me through film court scenes even those don't elicit one single emotion for or against any of the cardboard thin characters the film just has no real redeeming qualities whatsoever even the dialog is bad the thing is it's so full of clichÃ©s that it's laughable and that's the one thing that lifts this above a rating of 1 10 the albeit unintentionally so comic relief of the many clichÃ©s and stereotypes i didn't pay very much attention to the film but just about every time i looked at the screen there was something to laugh at one final note i considered using the line tori spelling can't act as a one line summary but i guess everyone knows that so i opted for the current one seeing as it's more informative all in all a thoroughly bad film but not the worst if you've got nothing else to do and if it's on tv good for a few laughs if you can sit through it 3 10
<START> i watched this knowing almost nothing about it other than the brief description i read here after watching it i was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish then i looked at the other stuff he's done to see if this was his first or second movie but no he did house on haunted hill and fear dot com he sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this one br br the story was pretty awful too could someone just fall in love with a girl because she's pretty but has the mind of a child i gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that i rather enjoyed near the end but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible
<START> and even then even they can live without seeing it to be honest this film if one deigns to call it that is of real interest only to bondage freaks bettie page fans will learn absolutely nothing new and i do mean nothing nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzies of experiencing anything familiar loved or cherished br br nevermind the abysmal screenplay the wooden less than community theater acting the utter absence of direction the crappy lighting or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values this is definitely hey kids let's make a movie movie making of the lowest order i suppose one could be thankful that at least they knew how to run the camera no i'm sorry to say that none of that is germane to why this thing is so outright wrong br br it's wrong because the young lady playing bettie page a somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the queen of curves is dark hair and the trademark bangs utterly fails to bring anything to the role beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged this is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this wretched excess but not for the wretched excess itself which consists primarily of a number of lovingly re enacted b d set pieces sandwiched between horrendously awful faux biographical scenes delineating ms page's fall from grace so to speak there's actually probably more information per se about page's life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the movie br br do not be fooled this is not a worthy companion film to the notorious bettie page this is not a worthy film at all this is a fetish piece that trades on the allure of one of the greatest pin ups of all time and does it without class without style and without any real sense of understanding the character of bettie page whatsoever no true bettie page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment i guarantee that br br avoid at all costs if free remember that time is money too yours may not be worth much but i'm betting it's worth enough that you'll be sorry you wasted time with this one that's it i'm done you've been warned
<START> cheap mediocre sequel to the successful the mummy's hand has presumably dead evil professor andoheb george zucco preparing his predecessor mehemet bey turhan bey for the quest of revenge overseas to america using mummy kharis lon chaney jr who has no reason being in the disguise any stunt man could do the same credible work lumbering around and choking victims in the goal of killing the surviving members of the banning family whose patriarch stephen dick foran and assistant babe hanson wallace ford retrieved the mummified corpse of princess ananka from her tomb in egypt andoheb considers this an outlandish act of desecration and wants the family to suffer for doing such an awful deed towards an ancient egyptian custom bey and the mummy kharis find a nice hideaway in a cemetery where the high priest of karnak can work as a caretaker in disguise every full moon bey will feed kharis a form of liquid derived of several tana leaves which will keep him not only alive but subservient to his master's wishes bey commands kharis to kill stephen and his sister jane mary gordon while also biding time for babe to return so that he will become victim 3 dr john banning john hubbard plans to wed isobel elyse knox but doesn't know that bey secretly covets his fiancÃ© making plans to kidnap her with kharis' help john's life is in danger because of his father he's also the last remaining member of the banning line if bey has isobel there's no chance of any more bannings being born the police must find kharis and the one responsible for his carnage bey br br this film is a continuation from hand set years later as members of that film foran ford zucco all appear in aging make up providing wrinkles showing the gaps in time as andoheb has been preparing for the deaths of the bannings the cornball romance of john and isobel seems merely in this plot so that bey will screw up endangering his perfect plan which was being carried out successfully before he loused it up and bey merely sees her frolicking with john on the grass the whole love at first sight rubbish really didn't wash for me plus you have the mummy being able to kill people with one arm is any mummy really that powerful this film also uses a ton of footage from the previous film to save budget on this sequel to it there really isn't that much story here and yes typical of universal monster pictures even in america a mob of people will light ho hum torches going after kharis you know how it'll end john and the super powerful kharis will square off in some huge mansion with fire burning all around them with the evil one being engulfed in flame
<START> having heard so many people raving about this film i thought i'd give it a go apart from being incredibly slow which i don't mind as long as the wait is worth it but it just isn't as many others have said there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this film just doesn't ring true the reaction of the 4 men switches from shock horror on finding the body to complete indifference whilst they fish surely if they were the type of men that would go on happily fishing then they would have just reported the body and said they had only discovered it after their fishing trip why on earth tie the body to a tree go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body 2 days previously its so hard to watch a film knowing that the behaviour of the main characters is so inconsistent as for the rest of the townsfolk well you'd think at least one of them might show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman the body itself naked except for the knickers what scenario leads to that if she was raped then why still the knickers if she was raped with the clothes on then why remove them afterwards bar the knickers if she wasn't raped then why take all her clothes off bar the knickers leaving yourself with evidence to dispose of i truly cant think of any realistic scenario that would lead to that other than killing someone to steal their clothes so you can fill up your jumble sale stall oh well its watchable but only just and only because despite the poor script the acting is strong
<START> it is one of the better indian movies i have seen lately instead of crappy song and dance or slum dog movies all the actors have showed the right emotions at the right intensity with right timing it is the hallmark of a good movie that it make the viewer go back and research the subject which exactly what i did checking on harilal i always enjoy akshay khanna's subtle style of acting and interestingly he had rather a complicated relationship with his own father vinod khanna albeit not as dramatic as gandhis and wonder how it helped him essay this character i was impressed by the direction and 2 thumbs up for anil kapoor for producing such a classy movie
<START> s s van dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with hollywood most of the film series' from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios but apparently van dine must have sold his rights to each book about philo vance one at a time note that paramount mgm warner brothers and more all released philo vance films only tarzan seemed to get around hollywood more br br mgm produced the garden murder case and starred edmund lowe as the fashionable detective of course mgm had the screen's original philo under contract at the time but bill powell was busy doing the thin man at the time and i guess louis b mayer decided to concentrate him there br br edmund lowe is a pretty acceptable philo vance lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with what price glory and then with a string of films with victor mclaglen with their flagg and quirt characters but after mclaglen got his oscar for the informer lowe seemed to fade into the b picture market br br the garden murder case involves three separate victims douglas walton gene lockhart and frieda inescourt the sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished br br i will say this though vance takes a very big chance in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of hitchcock
<START> this film is shoddily made unoriginal garbage i like romantic comedies sometimes watching a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner it's not something you are going to do all the time but the experience is so pleasurable that you can ignore how unwise you are being this movie made me think about how stupid i was for continuing to remain seated for its entire running time everything about it screamed made on the cheap it actually looks like they overexposed the film at certain points it is so washed out it boasts cheesy cgi and lame sets too br br the writing was clunky i know that you can usually expect some plot problems in a screwball comedy but you usually don't really care because you are laughing this movie is so unfunny that you actually sit there and wonder about the unlikely series of coincidences and completely unbelievable behavior involved events were placed in the film just to move the characters from one scene to the next or to provide exposition sure this is how all movies work but you shouldn't notice that it's happening inelegant that's the term i should use br br there was almost no one in the movie who was really likable i didn't care who ended up with whom as long as they all stayed the hell away from me and i didn't have to listen to them talk about it anymore why would the only really cool character in the movie the paul rudd character want to have anything to do with the completely bitchy condescending control freak played by eva longoria also almost all of the characters involved consistently picked the sleaziest solution to any situation a straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to hang out and bathe with with a woman he is attracted to the best feel good moment they could come up with was to tack on a happy ending for the same schmoe where he gets together with rudd's equally annoying lying kleptomaniac sister lake bell and eva longoria are very attractive appealing women maybe they will find something better to appear in down the road
<START> starring jim carrey morgan freeman jennifer anniston i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie i mean what a conceptual nightmare jim carrey playing god nothing is sacred anymore br br well this movie is hardly sacred but it also is not sacrilegious at least not to any great extent yes jim carrey has the powers of god for a while but he is not god confused i'll give you the low down br br jim carrey plays bruce nolan a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life he lives with his beautiful girlfriend grace anniston and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground br br then bruce gets a shot at anchorman only to have it underhandedly stolen by evan baxter obviously not please bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired br br much complaining and griping about god later bruce gets a page after a while he gets tired of it calling so he responds and goes to the omni presents building heh there he meets god freeman who is the boss electrician and janitor of the building i found this highly amusing god is the boss the holy spirit is the electrician and jesus christ is the janitor think about it boss obvious electrician the guy who keeps everything running janitor the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left brilliant br br anyway bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met god but when god gives bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing god he starts to believe a bit wonder why enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies br br since this is hollywood bruce obviously eventually smartens up learns his lesson and starts using his powers for the good of the world in the end he cries out for god to take it away and prays that his will be done not bruce's br br since it is jim carrey the movie is quite amusing and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it the movie is not perfect theology but for hollywood it is definitely a good attempt many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging and i applaud tom shadyac for his effort in this movie br br so while far from perfect definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it br br bottom line 3 5 out of 4 worth a view or two
<START> the turning point in the matador comes about half through the movie when danny an unsophisticated man from denver is sitting in the balcony of his mexico city hotel enjoying a quiet moment someone knocks on his door and knowing it's julian the paid assassin he refuses to answer but did he really br br richard shephard the director of the matador presents us with a character julian noble who shows no redeemable qualities in fact we have already seen him in action doing what he does best when julian meets danny at the bar of the camino real in mexico city he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a living br br danny who has come to sell his program to a mexican company but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter julian it's not until some time later on a cold winter night that the killer appears at danny's door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to tucson it's at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way br br pierce brosnan acting against type makes a great contribution with his irreverent julian noble just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character greg kinnear on the other hand plays the straight part of this odd couple hope davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why didn't she stay longer philip baker hall puts an appearance as the liaison between julian and his assignments br br richard shephard directs with style working with his own material the musical score is by rolfe kent and the crisp cinematography of david tattersall enhances everything
<START> in this extremely low budget i've seen home movies made with better production value australian utter rip off of the burning friday the 13th a band is planning to make a music video while on a houseboat they're stalked by a serial killer who was burned years before this movie is even proclaimed to be 'the worst australian film ever made' in it's dvd promotional material that's it's only selling point complete and utter rubbish in every considerable way perhaps a few chuckles here and there for bad movie lovers but it still made me want to burn out my retinas br br eye candy a quick flash of barely existent itty bitty titties in a lame shower scene br br my grade f
<START> i love this movie it is great film that combines english and indian cultures with feminist type issues such as girls wanting to play sports that were previously reserved for men it shows the struggles of both an indian person wanting to break outside her cultural barriers and women wanting to break outside the gender restrictions found in sports especially in england at the time i feel that the cultural struggles are more emphasized than the other issues br br in contrast to the other comment i do not think this movie is anything like dirty dancing or any other such chick flick this move is loved by many types of people men and women young and old alike
<START> an intriguing premise of hand drawn fantasy come to life in a child's fever dreams however i imagine the average nonfictional child is far more adept at scaring themselves than bernard rose is at riveting the viewer the duel between anna's two realities drags on far too long to sustain interest especially considering that the little girl playing her is the most abrasive child actor i've ever seen br br use only for kindling
<START> my mom and i have just recently become addicted to this show laughing our butts off i've only seen about 10 episodes and i am disappointed that i didn't pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled the story line is very funny the characters really have great personalities or not so great but they're still funny i tivo every episode of what i like about you amanda bynes and jennie garth as well as all of the cast never leave me bored while watching there is some unsuitable language for children and some sexual content but with a parental guide near you shouldn't have too much problems there is some sort of 'friends' type of relationship that attracts me to this show i really enjoy it
<START> i wasn't really fond of the first cube movie it was a good idea but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much didn't really feel the need to see its sequel but when i heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original i was intrigued thinking that maybe they would fix some of the original's problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters well i thought wrong br br cube zero starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the never ending maze of traps that plagues the people in the cube the filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two men's daily routine several questions are created from it concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation all of which are left entirely to the viewer the acting was a bit weak but all in all the movie's first half moved relatively well br br with the story moving on one of the two watchers begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing and later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped here is where everything rapidly starts to dissolve into dull cheese br br sent by the people who run the cube program we are introduced to the character jax along with his two underlings play a major reason as to why this movie is failure to start of jax looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a james bond movie complete with the ever popular glass eye that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first half's relatively nice pace whats more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie with some incredibly corny lines perhaps the screenwriter got bored and didn't care the acting itself degrades to a further low when the former watcher meets the group in the cube the entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following it br br again failing to impress on anything but weak characters dialog and acting cube zero is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie
<START> having seen the first ten episodes i must say this show sucks br br what bothers me the most is that the show was shot in canada i know it's cheaper but they should have shot it in california so we could have had scenes in the desert that would have been more true to the movie the first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold that does'nt feel very egyptian what worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient egypt here it feels like they're running around fighting aliens in a canadian forrest and it's so lame that appaerantly on other planets the fall comes as well you can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside vancouver it just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb br br and then there is richard dean anderson he is no kurt russel sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy russels performance a little bit but he is just not as cool as russel and not nearly as good an actor as russel and russells way of playing o neill well he was much more cynical andersons o neil is way too soft i liked it that russels version just did'nt give a s and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie br br michael shanks does a really good job as jackson though taking over from james spader br br teal'c is a really annoying character he is jaffa not a jaffa just jaffa aaaarrgh a former bodyguard of a pathetic ra character seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far teal'c speaks talks and acts like a robot i've seen better acting from jean claude van damme br br and the fact that teal'c and the ra character and the people they saved in the movie can speak english all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb what made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters br br as for the special effects they are really good in the pilot but the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap especially a planet they visit with crystals it's so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background it's an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds br br the x files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993 that was 4 years before sg 1 started and they did'nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode that sg 1 supposedly had they must have spend all the money on catering because i don't see it on the screen br br incredibly boring and pointless show that could have been great if they had shot the show in hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters
<START> the final film for ernst lubitsch completed by otto preminger after lubitsch's untimely death during production is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness romance and music fantasy and costume dramatics in a 19th century castle in southeastern europe a countess falls for her sworn enemy the leader of the hungarian revolt she's aided by her ancestor whose painted image magically comes to life betty grable in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers has never been more beautiful and her songs are very pleasant unfortunately this script by samson raphaelson taken from an operetta by rudolf schanzer and e welisch is awash with different ideas that fail to mesh or entertain the results are good looking but unabsorbing 1 2 from
