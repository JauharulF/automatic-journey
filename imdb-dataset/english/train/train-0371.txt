<START> such is the dilemma above that debbie must face at the close of this sam sherman production naughty stewardesses debbie has just hit town become a stewardess slept with an elderly rich man who she describes is in his 50's but obviously hit that mark a decade or two ago shoots nude scenes for a photographer she just met and then is the central element to a kidnapping extortion plot through it all and amidst all that emotional upheaval and soul searching what in heaven's name will debbie do well i cannot give it away completely but don't expect any real epiphany here let's face it naughty stewardesses is just what it wants to be at least two thirds through a soft core porn film with lots of topless women and a funny in that kitchy 70's way film there is no grand art here the movie was designed to make money and exploit a growing trend at the time to put nymphomaniacal stewardesses in films so that the audience could live out vicariously their voyeuristic tastes by todays standards the film is pretty tame what this film does do wrong is try to be some kind of statement film at the end c'mon anyone here believing that little diatribe by debbie while on the beach contemplating life she would spend more time picking out which halter top she will wear that day then do that and what about the ridiculous plot to steal 50 grand it didn't make sense to me so how on earth did these characters dig it anyone buying cal as a member of the plo something like that or even as a director for hardcore pornography he would be luck to get work at seven eleven this is as another reviewer noted more of a sam sherman piece then and al adamson piece you can tell when al is in complete charge there is virtually no budget and the film doesn't look nearly as polished as this adamson does a decent job directing this time and i have to give sherman credit to a degree while this film is bad just for what it was meant to be it has a certain style to it i liked the opening credits with the animation and photographs i even liked the music of sparrow silver heels was a somewhat catchy tune the movie doesn't look cheap really at all compare that to any of al's horror films as for the cast yes bob livingston is a bit old for the lead but some examination went into his character and the obvious thread that young women are attracted to men with money was explored as well i had major problems with robert smedley who was just plain awful in his role the girls have all got great sets so what else was required of them huh naughty stewardesses is relatively harmless exploitation film from the 70's and will serve as a living time capsule for certain aspects of life during that decade by the way did i mention it is a pretty bad picture
<START> sasquatch hunters actually wasn't as bad as i thought br br spoilers br br traveling into the woods park rangers charles landon kevin o'connor roger gordon matt latimore brian stratton david zelina spencer combs rick holland and his sister janet stacey branscombe escort dr helen gilbert amy shelton white her boss dr ethan edwards gary sturm and assistant louise keaton juliana dever to find the site of some reputed bones found in the area when they make camp the team discovers a giant burial ground and more strange bones littering the area when members of the group start to disappear they start to wander through the woods to safety it's discovered that a sasquatch is behind the killings and the team band together to survive br br the good news this wasn't as bad as i thought it would be the movie really starts to pick up some steam at around the half way point when the creature attacks that is a masterful series of scenes as the whole group is subjected to attacks by the creature and the suspense throughout the entire play out is extremely high the wooded area is most appropriately milked during these parts heightening the tension and wondering when a single person wandering around in the forest will get their comeuppance also spread quite liberally through the movie is the effective use of off screen growls and roars that are truly unworldly they really do add much to make this part so creepy as well as the other times the growling shriek is heard it's quite effective and works well it's quite nice that the later part of the film picks up the pace as it goes out pretty well on a high note of action one scene especially i feel must point out as being a special scene on first viewing as a man is running through the forest from the creature he spots the expedition that has gone on looking for it raising his hands to holler to them for help the second he goes to announce his presence is he attacked from out of nowhere and killed quite hastily it caught me by surprise and actually gave me a little jump on first viewing br br the bad news there was only a couple things to complain about here and one is a usual complaint the creature here is mostly rendered by horrible cgi which made him look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility it might've had the air of menace conjured up by the opening of the film is almost shot out the window when the creature appears on screen it's so distracting that it's a shame a little more work wasn't put into it i've complained about this one a lot and is something that really should be done away with as it doesn't look that realistic and is quite fake another big one is the off screen kills in here very often in the film is a person grabbed and then yanked away and then finding the bloody body afterward it's quite aggravating when the kills look nice and juicy afterward otherwise i don't really have much of a problem with this one as everything else that's usually critiqued about this one didn't really bother me but it is called on for others beyond this stuff br br the final verdict i kinda liked this one but it's still not the best sasquatch movie ever it's not supposed to be taken seriously and if viewed that way it's actually quoit enjoyable fans of these films should give this one a look and those that like the sci fi creature features might find some nice things in here as well br br rated r graphic language violence and some graphic carcasses
<START> recap according to legend the valkyrie brunhilda defied odin and was chained to a rock surrounded by an eternal fire only a warrior pure in heart can pass through the flames free brunhilda and release her from odin's claim and have her for himself now war is brewing in the norse lands and the king needs an alliance with the berserkers the berserkers are warriors claimed by odin's valkyries lusting for war blood and flesh and therefore outcasts but superior in battle the leader of the berserkers is a scorned son of the king boar and his price for the alliance is his brother the future king barek but after the king is victorious in battle he refuses to give up his only remaining son breaking his oath to boar and betray him and kill him boar is saved only by barek's call upon odin but this is only the start of the battle between the brothers and their final battle is about to start now a millennia later br br comments i had hopes that this would be a movie based upon some viking ground far too little quality movie about viking has been done it started out very good too with detailed longships and armors nice and fitting sceneries and an ok battle br br the foundation in the aesir myths is thin and seems very corrupted to me odin is much more vengeful spiteful and absent than i remind him from school and the valkyries has been turned into some vampire demons i'm no expert but that seems outright wrong br br but the fatal mistake made by this movie is to move the time setting from the original time period to today if the two brothers had fought it out in the correct time with some decent battles this movie would have been much better now the setting suddenly is changed to present day stockholm still odin is present and is sending boar and his berserkers for brunhilda and barek which gives silly scenes when armor clad and painted berserkers swordfights with barek among the industries beautiful mountains and woods have been exchanged for cement and when allowed to focus upon single fights instead of massive battles as in the beginning i quickly saw that the fights and skills of the actors are slow and clumsy br br the end result is thin story sometimes hard to follow and other times just silly and the only that could save it the action is drawn from slow dull and clumsy swordfights it draws very little from aesir myth or viking tradition thus both story and action fails and the movie is just plain bad br br finally as a swede this movie is a little confusing supposedly filmed entirely in south africa it still contains some familiar swedish signs plates and what seems to be an authentic police car however the effort is poor and only goes so far as to really set it in sweden no names are swedish perhaps with anya as the exception no familiar sceneries are swedish they supposedly speak a little ancient norwegian not swedish and uniforms both police and medical are clearly not swedish if they were not going to even try to do it correctly and really give the illusion that it is set in sweden why bother at all br br 4 10
<START> the penultimate collaboration between director anthony mann and star james stewart excluding the few days mann worked on night passage before parting company with the star under less than amicable circumstances the far country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption fighting it every step of the way this time he's a cattle driver whose response to labour problems challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail results in his cattle being confiscated by john mcintire's larcenous judge of the roy bean school of law and order stealing them back and taking them across the canadian border he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims br br while it's no great surprise which way stewart turns at the end he's a surprisingly callous critter along the way even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because it's not his problem for most of the film there's really only a hair's breadth between him and mcintire something the judge recognises immediately revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he's genially planning to lynch him in many ways the townspeople who put their faith in him probably recognise it too despite their appeals to his dead and buried better nature there's an unspoken acknowledgement that the only person who can stand up to the judge is someone almost as bad as he is br br as usual with mann there's an exceptional use of high country locations though for once the final showdown takes place on level ground and the film is almost perfectly cast with strong support from walter brennan harry morgan and ruth roman though corinne calvert's young romantic interest veers to the irritating sadly the great cinematography of the canadian rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average dvd transfer with only the theatrical trailer as an extra
<START> this movie is really special it's a very beautiful movie which starts with three orphans sho his brother shinji and their friend toshi they're poor children's living on the street but one day they succeeded to steal a bag full of money and then their able to live on to buy a house and their life seems to become much better they're making new friend life friends but something went wrong and they're becoming enemies and it all ends up with them killing each other br br i was negative about this movie in the beginning because when singers gackt solo ex singer in malice mizer hyde solo singer in l'arc en ciel both very famous in japan and wang lee hom taiwanese singer trying to become actors but this isn't like the other singers going actors movies they're doing a great job and with no earlier experience in movies except for lee hom who had been in two movies before br br this is absolutely one of my favorite movies maybe that's a little because i'm a very big fan of hyde but it was this movie who made me discover him br br well gackt playing the main character the orphan sho was a part of the group who wrote the script and it was he who insisted that hyde should play sho's friend the vampire kei at that time they didn't know each other at least not like friends but after the movie they became really good friend and that shows us too that they really worked hard on this movie and that they had good cooperation br br the movie have many different feelings running trough the story love hate sadness pain loneliness happiness and so on i think the first hour are the best it's so beautiful after that people are dying kei's leaving and it all changes so much but still it's a great movie it's the only movie who has ever made me cry it ends up so sad but still beautiful br br so if you haven't seen this movie you really should because it's wonderful but sad you won't regret it
<START> this is a gem of a movie not just for people who like fun and quirky premises but who love the history and traditions of sci fi and classic hollywood movies each alien of the martian crew is the embodiment of a classic sci fi character or member of hollywood royalty and it's pure pleasure watching them bounce of each other and the residents of big bean
<START> running only seventy two minutes this small overlooked 2006 dramedy is really just a two character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations taking place almost entirely in various non descript spots in southern los angeles the story itself is inconsequential but like sofia coppola's lost in translation the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter it also helps considerably that morgan freeman and paz vega are playing the characters finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become his big screen specialty freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat self indulgent movie star his character is driven to a low rent grocery store in carson where he will be able to research a role he is considering in an indie film br br out of work for a few years he is embarrassed when he sees dvds of his films in the bargain bin but his ego is such that he does not lack the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff of particular fascination to him is scarlet an embittered worker from spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency she has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company but her deep seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already still looking like penelope cruz's amazonian sister the beautiful vega one of the few redeemable aspects of james l brooks' execrable spanglish brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to scarlet she and freeman interplay very well throughout the story which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at target arby's and a full service carwash nothing earth shattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounters br br silberling keeps the proceedings simple but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in phedon papamichael's vibrant cinematography he lensed alexander payne's sideways and the infectious score by brazilian composer antonio pinto city of god there are fast cameos by bobby cannavale as scarlet's soon to be ex husband and as themselves danny devito and rhea perlman as well as a funny bits with jonah hill knocked up as the clueless driver and jim parsons the knight in garden state as a worshipful receptionist the 2007 dvd is overstuffed with extras including a making of documentary 15 days or less aimed at film students and running a marathon 103 minutes six extended scenes a light hearted but insightful three way conversation between silberling freeman and vega in the middle of target and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the dvd

<START> always fancied this film from the video cover eventually got round to buying it for a fiver in a sale and boy what a film a simply stunning performance from all of the case and it's filmed so beautifully even at times from a distance so you can barely hear what the dialogue is as if you really are that distance away picking up bits of the tale it's really moving frequently amusing and very watchable not much dialogue but is filmed in such a way that you feel so much throuout a 9 10 from me a must see
<START> what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica alba br br unfortunately the powers that be over at fox decided that they needed to fine tune the plotline within 3 episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep br br the moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works don't screw with it br br azjazz
<START> one the whole this movie isn't perfect it doesn't 'hang well' together as the story line is basically a bunch of hooks to hang jokes br br some of these jokes are a little 'too 80s' and tend to date the picture br br but some of these jokes are classic br br you know a movie has something special when you and your friends still reference silly quotes from it over 2 decades later br br plus there are a bunch of familiar faces michael keaton danny devito joe piscapo peter boyle marilu henner maureen stapleton bob eubanks griffin dunne and one of the last roles of alan hale jr the skipper from gilligan's island br br also there are some great absurdist moments like when johnny is labelling the puppies with a pricing gun or the pope making an appearance in johnny's neighborhood also the scene where the fake priest makes up a lot of words in latin is excellent summa cum laude magna cum laude the radio's too louda post meridian ante meridian uncle meridian br br other classic scenes include ramone maroney butchering the english language danny devito urging griffin dunne to 'play ball' peter boyle thinking he lost his manhood the fake vd movie br br this movie is no home run but like 'porky's' it has enough classic comedy bits to make it memorable
<START> whilst i have loved haunted house movies such as amityville and poltergeist this made for tv adaption of susan hills book packs a huge punch on the horrors of hollywood br br with a brilliant cast many of which star in heartbeat and other tv dramas great acting and fantastic setting which portrays 1920's life convincingly it has all the right ingredients to entice the viewer into what is a powerful ghost story br br herbert wise did not need blood violence or gore to send chills down the spines of an audience using your own imagination the woman in black is a figure of fear and dread and whose presence is never absent once she first appears br br the main character arthur kidd a solicitor learns about his unseen spectre on his mission to settle the estate the widow dies and arthur spends few nights inside her dreary home in which he notices many oddities which may haunt him for some days some of the scenes are very unsettling and claustrophobic particularly the locked room which opens itself which turns the generator off and closes arthur in darkness the film becomes more harrowing the more you put yourself in arthurs shoes and his efforts to shake this ghost off the writer puts many chilling additions into the story an example being the tin soldier's re appearance one is eager to learn the meaning of it all the fact we never really learn that much about the widow leaves more to the imagination and makes it all the more unsettling br br the widow for the most part looks vicious and intimidating the scene after winding the generator sent the chills down me a woman who appears out of nowhere on isolated marshy land with a howling wind Â having been on such properties myself i can appreciate how isolating this is and the scene in the inn was perhaps the most horrible things i've seen one i don't wish to watch in a hurry or show to elderly relatives i have often woken up at night thinking she was behind me in my sleep br br the woman in black is a great tv movie and a lost gem i agree to some extent the internet hype for this film has been totally overblown and can see why people were disappointed after spending the best of Â£50 on it but i think the net has defeated hidden gems because it makes films like these over exposed i think it's still brilliant and fantastically acted and i consider it the greatest ghost story of the last century
<START> this modern film noir with its off beat humour and dizzying succession of plot twists delivers a story full of surprises dangerous characters and excellent entertainment from start to finish it's impossible not to empathise with the honest unassuming hero or to be gripped by the ways in which he tries to navigate his way out of the terrible predicaments that he finds himself in so all you can do is fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride br br the story of an ordinary guy who makes a poor decision and then finds that the repercussions propel him into an uncontrollable sequence of events from which he is unable to extricate himself is pure film noir the same is true of the themes of murder deceit corruption and duplicity which are pervasive throughout many of the familiar noir visual motifs are also present such as the way in which cigarette smoke is lit the rain soaked roads at night the heavily shadowed interiors and the lines of shadow created by louvred doors across people's faces br br michael williams nicolas cage an injured war veteran without money or a job stops off at a bar in red rock wyoming and is mistaken by the proprietor wayne brown j t walsh for a hit man that he's arranged to employ to murder his wife suzanne lara flynn boyle michael a naturally reticent person does nothing to disabuse wayne of his misapprehension especially as he could use a job and at first doesn't realise what he'd be expected to do after having been told what his mission is and been given a 5 000 advance he goes to see suzanne and warns her about wayne's plan she doesn't seem overly concerned about the danger she's in and offers michael double the fee wayne had offered for him to eliminate her husband br br michael decides to take the money he'd received from both parties and leave town his plan fails however when he accidentally drives into a man who is standing in the middle of the road and decides to take him to hospital to receive treatment for his injuries at the hospital things get more complicated when it emerges that the patient is suzanne's lover and he has two bullets in his stomach this leads to the local law enforcement officers getting involved and the revelation that wayne is the sheriff from this point on things get even more complicated and also decidedly more dangerous especially when the real hit man lyle from dallas dennis hopper arrives on the scene br br red rock west has some great moments of suspense an example of this is the scene in which michael makes his escape from wayne's bar and also some great performances from its very strong cast nicolas cage's expressions are extremely natural and convincing as he reacts to a variety of situations with anxiety surprise or uncertainty and j t walsh is also particularly good as a deceptive character who's always concealing more than he's actually saying dennis hopper is intensely threatening as the vicious contract killer a role he plays with great gusto and lara flynn boyle looks suitably cold and calculating as the femme fatale dwight yoakam also provides some good support and moments of humour in his cameo role as a no nonsense truck driver br br incredibly red rock west was originally destined to be denied a general cinema release but has justifiably emerged from its modest beginnings to eventually be recognised as the great movie that it really is
<START> well on it's credit side if it can be said to have one timothy hines did manage to capture the original setting of h g wells' outstanding novella but other than that well to call a spade a spade it sucks bigtime what the master ed wood could have done with the alleged 20 million dollar budget timothy hines really does make mr wood who was a flawed genius anyway look like the best filmmaker of all time the special effects i guess you'd call them that are not even up to computer game standards the acting is well perhaps about dinner theater comparable and the accents are atrocious at the risk of sounding offensive a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is especially poor ogilvy well ahem gay poor ogilvy minces and flounces about the bogus english countryside waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor hey the stormtroopers in star wars had neat white body armor too and it didn't work either they still got blasted even when ogilvy and company get fried by the martians' 'heat ray' they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance even when they're theoretically dead and reduced to skeletons which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing maybe timothy hines rented the skeletons from ray harryhausen being left over from jason and the argonauts or was it josie and the pussycats i dunno the soldiers presumably because they're 'military' all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him wow i loved it but the 'soldiers' all looked like they were either fascist troops from the spanish civil war or boer commandos which would be more or less correct for the period perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius hines oddly enough the character of the curate looks exactly like he's drawn in the original illustrations by warwick goble and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting oh yeah musn't forget the thunder child in the book the warship is described as an ironclad torpedo ram it was meant to ram enemy ships yet it's bow was crumpled after ramming the tinker toy constructed martian war machines with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak and she sank an ironclad warship like thunderchild could've rammed the titanic and survived but i guess the royal navy was bound by the same lowest bidder constraints as our own military the costumes are all wrong especially the british army and police uniforms cobbled together mostly from usmc alphas and timbo in an obvious homage to western films of yore has obviously set his movie in wild western england because all his riders are using western saddles the accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of scottish regional accent used by clan macabre and magically delicious irish accents from county malarky on the credit side and contrary to what one reviewer wrote the only genuine authentic feature of this thing is the artillery the guns are not from the civil war but appear to my eye and research as bona fide british nine or 12 pounder rifled breach loaders perfectly authentic to the period so was the ammunition shown being used but the artilleryman who is a driver in the horse artillery was not shown correctly driving his limber you don't sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team you ride the nearside wheel horses the opening using what i believe is authentic period film footage is okay and the score's not bad however to the best of my knowledge weybridge has never had an underground and it certainly didn't in 1898 br br but growing up reading this novel i am very disappointed even more disappointed then i was at spielberg's zillion dollar special effects laden version maybe his version would have profited by swapping anthony piana for tom cruise and vice versa i have a lot more to say but i'll let it go at this for now i wish somebody would make a good version of war of the worlds that's faithful to the original timmy's vision is fine for a high school film class or maybe i should say pretentiously stupid for a college level film student and about as bad which is about the best i can say for this thing but that's about it oh yeah just where did the budget go and what happened to michael caine i'd like to hear his comments i have a sneaking suspicion that timbo orson wood hines' breathtaking bound breaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risk taking director's ticket to cult stardom because i must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie which i didn't pay for anyway but was thoughtfully sent to me by a friend who burned a dvd copy for me with no malicious intent that i've been able to determine i must add here that i thought blackmoon's dubbed and abridged version was not only a vast improvement but an absolute hysterically funny in a good way treat to watch i find it hard to watch master timbo's version after blackmoon keep it up tim make your own version of dune now it just awaits the hand of a master like you and all you headupyourass snobs who hated cloverfield forget it it cannot beat timbo hines artistry for sheer hilarious awfulness hey get a life timbo is worse than the master ed wood i kid you not
<START> less than 10 minutes into this film i wanted it to end as it was painful all this horror movie was about was a group of whiny bitches doing stupid things for 90 minutes arguing crying and screaming do not let the positive reviews fool you as this really is a terrible movie and you really shouldn't watch it br br the movies plot had potential to be something great but it just doesn't happen a group of five teenage girls are driving home one night when they find themselves being pursued by a crazed female driver who wants to kill them two minutes into the movie and the characters are already arguing and this doesn't stop all we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls whining crying screaming acting and arguing none of the dialogue is even remotely interesting too so you don't get to really know these characters or enjoy them br br the acting was terrible and i was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers none of these women looked a day under 20 and one of them easily looked like she was nearly 30 years old at least get people who look the age none of them gave even remotely decent performances and just seemed like they were picked off the street or were friends of the director with no acting abilities the actress who played the killer overdone it but she at least showed something that the other girls didn't a little bit of talent br br the characters don't help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny stupid bitches that is all i can really say about them and it did not help that they all survived if i have to go into detail in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and having their car knocked a lot one girl injures herself and is whining about it four of them aren't wearing seat belts what do you expect one of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer and you all just happen to be conveniently too hurt to help whatever br br the filming of the movie is absolutely terrible i don't care if this movie had a budget the size of a peanut the filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie the cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls pushed up against a window somewhere and the amount of times the camera blurred out shook and brushed up against an actress was horrendous it was also grainy and at times you couldn't hear what characters were saying not that it was anything worth listening to br br supposedly the killers car in the movie that supposedly got hit even though we only heard the accident is actually the directors car in real life no wonder they didn't show the car getting hit this movie is so cheap they can't even show a car getting a little scratched up oh gotta mention the soundtrack also if that's what it was it was horrid sad one second then hard rock the next br br at the end of the day five across the eyes just feels like a terrible home movie filmed in the middle of the road at night with a bunch of stupid girls screaming and arguing for 90 minutes it doesn't help when the script is terrible the scares tension suspense and hardly even any gore to make up for it are absent the acting is terrible and the picture quality and filming are horrendous br br this was a horrible low budget movie avoid it at all costs br br 1 10
<START> br br get your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick speakman's considerable kempo skill nice spin kicks decent with the sticks poor couch is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting the plot isn't half bad just executed pretty poorly but if you're seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts you're missing the boat entirely and for a movie that is supposed to take place in koreatown way way too few korean actors even extras
<START> if you have ever seen a movie by brian avenet bradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on imdb you know that most of the comments and votes are faked trust me you will be bored people of the production team write their feedback themselves sometimes they even admit it but that's not enough they also click constantly no whenever there is a negative comment on the movie that's why negative critics are always placed behind the hyped ones br br the movie itself is bad bad bad bad acting bad lighting bad script bad ending believe me now if not you will believe me later br br brian avenet bradley might be quite a good business man otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies okay they are cheap but nevertheless but as a creative person he is a complete failure
<START> when the movie was released it was the biggest hit and it soon became the blockbuster but honestly the movie is a ridiculous watch with a plot which glorifies a loser the movie has a tag line preeti madhura tyaga amara which means love's sweet but sacrifice is immortal in the movie the hero of the movie ganesh sacrifices his love for the leading lady pooja gandhi even though the two loved each other his justification is the meaning of the tag line this movie influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this loser like sacrificial attitude very thoughtful and hence became the cult movie it is when they could have moved on with their lives ganesh's acting in the movie is amateurish crass and childishly stupid he actually looks funny in a song onde ondu sari when he's supposed to look all stylish and cool his looks don't help the leading role either his hair style is badly done in most part of the movie pooja gandhi cant act her costumes are horrendous in the movie and very inconsistent br br the good part about the movie is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music by mano murthy which are actually the true saving graces of the movie also the lyrics by jayant kaikini are very well penned the director yograj bhat has to be lauded picturization the songs in a tasteful manner br br anyway all in all except for the songs the movie is a very ordinary one
