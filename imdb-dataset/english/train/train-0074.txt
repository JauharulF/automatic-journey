<START> markham says urbane gentleman crime solver philo vance william powell to the district attorney i'm coming more and more to the belief that archer coe was killed in this room that poker this dagger sheath now these fragments it's all here but vance markham says do you mean to tell me a dead man walked upstairs i'm not trying to tell you anything but the facts vance says this is the most remarkable case in my experience br br we're sympathetic wealthy arrogant archer coe disliked it seems by all who knew him had been found slumped in a chair in his bedroom pistol in his hand and a gunshot wound to his head but wait further examination shows coe had been hit hard by a blunt instrument that fractured his skull then there's the dagger wound in his back complicating matters is that coe's bedroom door and windows all had been locked from the inside coe was no suicide this was murder but how could the killer have escaped what was the specific motivation since there are so many suspects and why was coe's brother brisbane coe found dead in the main floor closet br br the kennel murder case now 73 years old still provides a stylish look at the old locked room classic whodunit what makes it work as well as it does is first the mystery is complicated and clever but still is logical second is the amusing assured performance of william powell consider his work as philo vance as something as a rehearsal for his great performances as nick charles few things escape vance he uses his wits to piece things together he's also good company powell was a star in the twenties and moved steadily upward in status and popularity when the talkies took over his intelligence style and effortless sophistication have made him one of the most contemporary seeming of actors from the past br br also pleasant is seeing a few other great faces there's mary astor as hilda lake the young resentful and potentially rich ward of coe paul cavanaugh as a titled brit hovering around hilda helen vinson with her notably sultry and selfish manner watch her really do her stuff in vogues of 1938 etienne giraudot a small elderly man as the fussy dr doremus whose job as coroner and medical examiner keeps taking him away from his meals and ralph morgan as archer coe's private secretary this movie has a high percentage of middle aged men without an ounce of fat who can wear snug english cut tailored suits with ease most of all is eugene palette with his noble belly and gravel voice as detective sergeant heath sergeant heath and vance are long time acquaintances who actually seem to like each other
<START> full house was and still is a great show it's a good show for people of all ages and is also a good family show there really aren't any shows like it anymore the kids are very cute and even though it's a bit cheesy it's still good especially for anyone who watched it when they were a kid i would love to see the cast interviewed now anyone that would like to see interviews of the cast kind of like a where are they now type thing for the special features of the dvd should go to the petition spot website and sign a petition titled full house reunion on dvd as there is a petition for this in hopes that the cast may want to do it yay for full house
<START> what can i say oh yeah those freaking fingers are so weird they scare the heck out of me but it is such a funny film jim carrey works the grinch if you havent already seen it then what you waiting for an invitation go go and get watch it you dont know what your missing
<START> this was a hit in the south by southwest sxsw film festival in austin last year and features a fine cast headed up by e r 's gloria reuben and a scenery chewing john glover though shot on a small budget in nyc the film looks and sounds fabulous and takes us on a behind the scenes whirl through the rehearsal and mounting of what actors call the scottish play as a reference to the word macbeth is thought to bring on the play's ancient curse the acting company exhibits all the emotions of the play itself lust jealousy rage suspicion and a bit of fun as well the games begin when an accomplished actor is replaced in the lead role by a well known pretty face from the tv soap opera scene in order to draw bigger crowds the green eyed monster takes over from there and the drama unfolds nicely fine soundtrack and good performances all around the dvd includes director's commentary and some deleted scenes as well
<START> i went to see ashura as 2005 fantasia festival kickoff man that was one cool kick off the director was supposed to be in montreal for the canadian premiere but due to health reasons he's still in japan oh lord i hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies br br the plot is pretty simple but somewhat original the demons are roaming in edo in japan and swordsmans called demon wardens are slaying them and fearing the rebirth of ashura the demon goddess who's sleeping and supposedly is very kick ass br br it brings us to izumo some kind of elite swordsman called demon slayer and his buddy jaku who's the typical violent jealous asshole br br seems boring well now it thickens br br izumo took his retirement from killing demons since he slayed a young kid on the impression that he was the demon he never knew but he did killed her so izumo went on with his life and recycled himself in kabuki theater in a boat joyride on a nice night izumo spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and restart to slay demons for the good cause the cause of love and damn the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre br br izumo carries the movie as far as playing goes he is the total package he knows how to fight hell yeah he knows he's witty he's intelligent and he has that grit you never have to yell no izumo it's a trap the guy already knows it he has that common sense he's really the perfect hero br br as far as cinematography goes the esthetics are pretty interesting it's by far the movie that looks the most like a manga it's creamed full of special effects and nothing at all cost will prevent this movie to look realistic it's pretty amazing lots of colours an unreal photography other than that it's pretty straightforward but like i said the main character is carrying the movie a must see a tale lead by masterful hands
<START> this show stinks for parents they usually want their kids to watch something good for them it is usually educational funny and bright br br is it educational no the doodlebops sing and that's it they usually sing about themselves they don't try teaching anything br br is it funny no the doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke and laugh at it br br is it bright it's so bright it's painful as far as color s everything is extremely bright so that's good but nothing is ever wrong in the world of the doodlebop's therefore they are always happy a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad br br the show is also extremely cheesy every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny it's overkill br br for kids it's entertaining but past the age of 2 you won't want your kids to see it they'll never know how to grow up
<START> without a doubt this is one of the worst films i've ever wasted money on the plot is erm sorry did i say there was a plot the scariest moment was when nope can't think of one the best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was nope can't think of one for that either you knew who the killer was right from the start there was nothing scary about the whole movie in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister misty in the shower and when you saw nurse toppan take her top off this film should only be watched to get an idea of how not to make a horror movie
<START> moonwalker is such a great movie from start to finish you cant take your eyes away i love all the clips of michael singing and dancing and i just love the 'studio tour' bit soo funny and the 'mini movie' is to cool with all the special fx etc michael is a genius and always will be
<START> this final entry in george lucas's star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot however this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series on the contrary sure it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow going at times but return of the jedi still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission br br the first third of the movie where luke and his friends rescue han from the palace of jabba the hutt is a classic jabba a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language not only makes a great villain but a memorable one too it must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product actually what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of jabba's court including the intimidating slavering rancor and scary sarlaac pit monster it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while br br things get a little bit slower around the second act where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of endor home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart ewoks most of the complaints about return of the jedi that i've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga i don't totally agree with that although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should however their leader wicket played by warrick davis is a delightfully memorable creation and watching how they handle the imperial troops' technology with their simple natural weapons provides a nice contrast br br by the time we get to the third act though the pace picks up again as we intercut between the ewoks battle against the troops lando and the rebel forces launching an attack against the empire's all new half completed death star and luke's final showdown with darth vader and the emperor the latter ties with the jabba palace sequence as the highlight of the movie mark hamill flexes his acting chops once again as luke skywalker in these scenes and watching him as a fully matured jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance also as iconic as james earl jones' voice as darth vader is he is rivaled only by the shriveled crone like emperor played with deliciously raspy frightening evil by ian mcdiarmid the tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored br br the star wars movies have always set standards for special effects and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors the space battle fights are as exhilarating as always and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout of course given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence the acting is classic star wars fare hamill harrison ford and carrie fisher all mature and deepen into their roles and anthony daniels provides more hilarious moments as c 3po frank oz's yoda only appears in two scenes but he makes the most of it and yes there's also john williams' music br br all told while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle the first and third acts deliver in style making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever br br in 1997 george lucas re released the classic star wars in digitally restored and revamped special editions which featured added in effects and or shots as well as some enhancements of the three return of the jedi appears to have caused the most commotion with star wars fans perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out of place albeit funny if you're not so easily offended jedi rocks musical number in jabba's palace which although technically amazing does disrupt the flow of the film however i did like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy this dvd version features yet more tweaking we get to see more montage finale scenes notably on naboo where we hear what sounds like jar jar binks screaming wesa free and in what is probably the most controversial change hayden christensen as the specter of anakin skywalker in the closing scenes probably due to the intense and unfair disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii attack of the clones it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone however if you're watching the star wars saga chronologically and contemplating about it chances are you may react a little differently nonetheless it is an issue that fans have raised so it's probably best to be warned beforehand br br as nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the definitive editions of his classic trilogy and when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga as lucas intended it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent the original films will always be engraved in our memories but these new incarnations are just as much fun if one can give them a chance
<START> as a big time prince fan of the last three to four years i really can't believe i've only just got round to watching purple rain the brand new 2 disc anniversary special edition led me to buy it wow i was really looking forward to watching it but i wasn't prepared for just how electric it actually is prince's musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding he really has the moves in this one i am very familiar from repeated listens with the classic purple rain album and all its songs but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics like computer blue the beautiful ones when doves cry and purple rain itself there is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where prince and the revolution perform the closing songs baby i'm a star and i would die for u show how much energy and sheer talent prince was brimming with in his mid 20s he's overflowing it blew me away it even makes michael jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years br br prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams drive her to a lake make her jump in then drive off absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight br br some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the film's overall charm morris day is the coolest cat on the block and hilarious and when his group the time perform the bird you get to see morris day and jerome benton light up the stage minneapolis funk style i love their dancing in this bit and how benton provides morris with a mirror mid performance br br i already can't wait to watch it again i really can't extras are terrific particularly seeing a young eddie murphy pre beverly hills cop admit he is a prince groupie
<START> hayao miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand drawn animation as a form of storytelling yet often he is being compared to walt disney that is just so unfair because it becomes apparent by watching miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist he really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children and laputa is indeed one awesome ride br br but where can i begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and i wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination ask yourself this question if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical what would it be like the answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch laputa because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing from the train chase to the amazing air flying sequences and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself not to mention the excellent score by joe hisaishi everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here
<START> the only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself i usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of what to expect from a movie i don't know much about it's unfortunate when there aren't many comments for a certain tile because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast you don't get an idea of what to expect i read the review before watching this title and i don't know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from douglas and blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered even when the material was not the greatest i found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable it isn't one of the great all time classics but a pleasant and funny diversion much more than you can hope for in most newer movies if you are a fan of these stars you will not be disappointed
<START> i had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school as figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through it had an interesting side to it but it just doesn't live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original we have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust then we have the father who is always gone then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does on to the story like i said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling everything about this fell into clichÃ© the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl they get together have sex and then boom we have a little kid perhaps it could've been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved i've seriously gotten more emotion out of leatherface and his chainsaw than i did out of any actor in this film and that's pretty bad seeing as the leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted so far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie i've seen was juno so far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message like i said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity i really hope someone decides to either re make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential
<START> let's just say i had to suspend my disbelief less for spiderman than i did for hooligans that is to say i have less of a problem believing toby mcguire can stick to buildings than i do elija wood throwing down with toughs in manchester i won't get into specifics as i don't want to write a spoiler but the idea of grown professional british men getting into near death scraps every weekend is well funny and this film is not the fighting the idea of fighting is taken far too seriously the gravity of the pugilism the reverence with which the subject matter is treated becomes irritating as it neither establishes or resolves the conflict it seems as though the plot with holes big enough to drive a guiness truck through has been slapped together with a contrived fish out of water theme so that viewers can gaze into woods teary eyes as he learns how to become a man ie hitting other young men of opposing football tastes with blunt objects and then running away as fast as he can the characters are cartoonish especially the americans at harvard the character development and story line are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the picture unfortunately the absurdity of the film doesn't reach its height until nearly the end which by then you'll have spent nearly two hours of your life you are never getting back pick up the football factory or fight club instead of this corny and disappointing dud it doesn't waste time with empty melodrama the tired old yankee in king aurthur's court or weepy parables of coming of age bullsh t they're just pure dark and clever fun the way violence is supposed to be
<START> this show has all the typical characters in a comedy the good guy the idiot the pervert the rich girl but it's set on the 70's that's the only difference that it has with other tv comedies i don't know how you can like this show its humor is pathetic i mean the jokes are so direct a typical dialog is this fez oh jackie i want to have sex with you audience laughs jackie fez you're a pervert audience laughs fez oh yes i am audience cheers and applauds this isn't funny i think that if it didn't have those laughs i don't know how you call that in english sorry you wouldn't laugh at all this isn't intelligent comedy this is an insult to the public i like most of the american comedies but this isn't good at all i would give it 4 out of 10 sorry for my poor english again
<START> lindsay anderson was very much a european film maker whereas the likes of david lean ridley scott and alan parker make spectacular movies involving visuel scope anderson s movie are more about social commentary and subtext so much so that the message often ends up taking over the entire film whose primary function should be to entertain the audience br br what you think of if comes down to what you think of british film makers i m very much of the view that cinema should be a universial medium the best brit movie makes are those who try to emulate hollywood in my opinion if you want to send a message try pony express and i find the movie dated pretentious and too set in the 1960s 1968 was the summer of love and the year of student rebellion in france you can just imagine every single french leftist worshipping this movie especially the climax french new wave film makers will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes but a mainstream international will dislike it and many will dislike it intensely
<START> this movie is stuffed full of stock horror movie goodies chained lunatics pre meditated murder a mad vaguely lesbian female scientist with an even madder father who wears a mask because of his horrible disfigurement poisoning spooky castles werewolves male and female adultery slain lovers tibetan mystics the half man half plant victim of some unnamed experiment grave robbing mind control walled up bodies a car crash on a lonely road electrocution knights in armour the lot all topped off with an incredibly awful score and some of the worst foley work ever done br br the script is incomprehensible even by badly dubbed spanish horror movie standards and some of the editing is just bizarre in one scene where the lead female evil scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the badly dubbed that is fantastical i do not understand explain to me again how this is exposition scenes that litter this movie there is a sudden hand held cutaway of the girl's thighs as she gets out of bed for no apparent reason at all other than to cover a cut in the bad scientist's mwahaha all your werewolfs belong mine speech though why they went to the bother i don't know because there are plenty of other jarring jump cuts all over the place even allowing for the atrocious pan and scan of the print i saw br br the director was according to one interview with the star drunk for most of the shoot and the film looks like it it is an incoherent mess it's made even more incoherent by the inclusion of werewolf rampage footage from a different film the mark of the wolf man made 4 years earlier featuring the same actor but playing the part with more aggression and with a different shirt and make up is there a word in spanish for continuity and more padding of another actor in the wolfman get up ambling about in long shot br br the music is incredibly bad varying almost at random from full orchestral creepy house music to bosannova to the longest piano and gong duet ever recorded thinking about it it might not have been a duet it might have been a solo the piano part was so simple it could have been picked out with one hand while the player whacked away at the gong with the other br br this is one of the most bewilderedly trance state inducing bad movies of the year so far for me enjoy br br favourite line ilona this madness and perversity will turn against you how true br br favourite shot the lover discovering his girlfriend slain dropping the candle in a cartoon like demonstration of surprise rank amateur directing there
<START> gerard phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie funny tender brave and lover he gives a superior dimension to a movie which is even a masterpiece as much by the other actors gina lollobrigida miaoooou as by the story or the rhythm never boring always creating new emotions for me the best french movie of all time
<START> baldwin has really stooped low to make such movies the script the music just about everything in this movie is a waste of time br br the sound fx do not sound real they stick out way too much technical gadgets etc if they are trying to make a movie about things like this at least try to get real with it and drop those extra bleeps and beeps because those gadgets don't really make loud sounds like that natural sounds like footsteps and such are non existent which gives it a void like atmosphere br br directing seems to be ok for such a low budget film i sure hope it was a low budget production although it does seem fairly amateurish at times br br most characters seem empty and false they simply haven't casted this movie very well i'd imagine it would've been a better idea to make baldwin speak some spanish than to make spanish actors speak english when we all know that theirs is the language which is more vibrant and alive that is why the actors performance can suffer greatly if an odd language is used i mean could finally someone realise how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak english with a bad accent it's should've a long ago buried corpse in movie production the production team ever heard of subtitles this movie again manages to depict european police as lazy and corrupt the societies as vulnerable and helpless i mean if the plot again goes like the interpol can't do jack so let's call one american to bring down this international syndicate or whatever br br sony pictures treads on the same path as columbia before it just producing movies for the hell of it i'd imagine them to have some self respect also are buyers supposed to buy every dirty title just because sony puts out something good a few times a year maybe they should've used the same team as who were making di que si say i do it's spoken in spanish and paz vega and santi millan do a decent job keeping the movie afloat looks and sounds much better come on sony wake up produce less sell more
<START> this is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple the movie portrais a couple in italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion infidelity juggling work and family br br the so called culture of death that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think br br a must see i hope it gets distributed as it should br br congratulations on the cast and director br br two thumbs up and a 10 star evaluation from me
