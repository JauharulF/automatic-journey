<START> well where to begin let's just say this avoid this movie at all br br costs it's based on a cartoon series the movie makes the cartoon look br br like hamlet filled with emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to be br br here lousy camera work terrible music and enough product placement to br br make you want to never visit yahoo again this movie is really the br br bottom of the barrel to quote the new yorker matthew broderick and br br rupert everett mug their way through this picture with the gay abandon br br of men who have spotted a rare species of paycheck in the distance br br they should pay us some of the millions they earned for watching it br br awful
<START> if you enjoy the original snl cast and shows then avoid this movie at all costs when this first came out my friends and i waited in line for over an hour to get in to a sold out movie house half way through the movie the theatre was 3 4 empty we refused to leave thinking it would get better when the movie ended we were the only ones left in the theatre the movie lasted only one day in all theaters then vanished from sight in interviews with mr mike he refused to comment on this film the film was an inside joke on the episodes of snl that came out right after the films release and closing in one day we all tried to contact mr mike by phone and mail to get a refund but were totally ignored
<START> in 1967 mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness when they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago something evil slipped through before the gate was closed twenty two years ago the government paranormal research agency bureau 713 was directed by professor lionel hudgens matthew walker who performed experiments with orphan children on the present days one of these children is the paranormal investigator edward carnby christian slater who has just gotten an abkani artifact in south america and is chased by a man with abilities when an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night he discloses that demons are coming back to earth with the support of the anthropologist aline cedrac tara reid and the leader of the bureau 713 cmdr richard burke stephen dorff and his squad they battle against the evil creatures br br in spite of having a charismatic good cast leaded by christian slater tara reid and stephen dorff alone in the dark never works and is a complete mess without development of characters or plot the reason may be explained by the brilliant interview of director uwe boll in the extras of the dvd where he says that videogames are the bestsellers of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore further his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty five years old sorry but i find both assertions disrespectful with the younger generations i have a daughter and a son and i know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says further imdb provides excellent statistics to show that mr uwe boll is absolutely wrong my vote is three br br title brazil alone in the dark Â o despertar do mal alone in the dark Â the awakening of the evil
<START> okay first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free first this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3d it is for the most part but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2d what it's not that hard to film in a car second the story isn't very good there are a lot of things wrong with it br br third why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed watch it for a good laugh but don't waste your time buying it just download it or something for cheap
<START> i don't know much about the rat pack and frank sinatra always seemed a bit too self consciously full of himself to me so when i call this one of my all time faves it's nothing to do with a tribute band mentality as another reviewer says mad dog time is about symbolism not realism it's kafkaesque a pity kyle maclachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd when he was so good as josef k it's stylish knowing sardonic and slick jeff goldblum is navigating his way around a variety of characters trying not to get shot and acting deftly rather than dorkily trying to stay abreast of what he knows and others don't whom he can outshoot and whom he can't gabriel byrne and richard dreyfuss his best performance have a ball and the supporting cast look spot on the symbolism the settings the one outdoor motion shot with jeff goldblum walking down the steps seems really weird after so much lounge lizardry the dialogue style not practicality is the order of the day it's all about characters interacting not really gangsterism fun to watch must've been fun to do what the critics were up to is really a mystery
<START> after watching revolt of the zombies starring future academy award winner dean jagger i was left with one burning question how was a society that created these ultimate warrior fighting machines ever defeated in the first place br br that's the question you'll be pondering if you take time to watch revolt of the zombies towards the end of world war i the french discover a cult from occupied cambodia where these undead creatures who cannot be stopped with bullets form a brigade of monks who go over the top and dislodge the hun br br this scares the living fecal matter out of everyone concerned so an international expedition is formed to find out destroy the secret of these zombies so no nation can get their hands on it and rule the world br br but we've got some dissent in those ranks first is snidely whiplash villain roy d'arcy who murders the buddhist monk who has the secret and second is dean jagger power is the ultimate aphrodisiac as we all know and he's determined to woo dorothy stone away from rival robert noland br br i think you've got some idea how this comes out especially since a race of zombies didn't conquer the world for one country dean jagger as he got the oscar for twelve o'clock high must have shuddered every time he thought about this film and the awful dialog he tried to give a spark of sincerity to br br moral of the story you might make an ultimate warrior with the zombie potion and the zombie chant but you can't make an ultimate love slave
<START> it's easy to see how this below average screenplay got by in the early sales pitch meetings at regency films and later with fox cross the superhero genre with a comedic take on fatal attraction voilÃ  i don't know how on earth a talented director like ivan reitman got involved unless the pay was just too tempting a dateless employee at an architectural design firm in n y c meets a girl on the subway and asks her out despite the fact she's distracted and unpleasant he eventually gets her into bed only to find out later she's the big apple's resident superhero g girl this distaff superman with powers bestowed upon her by a fallen meteorite isn't a fantasy heroine however screenwriter don payne has conceived her as a needy possessive vindictive bitch he telegraphs this to us from miles away though uma thurman still plays the role for sassy laughs this is the kind of worthless movie that can't let an insult slip by our introduction to leading man luke wilson talking with rainn wilson on the train is accompanied by a sour dig at gays it prods at us to be assured these two buddies are strictly ladies' men after being approached by g girl's nemesis who wants to zap her powers wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman scorned and isn't that better after all thurman's early performances in films like henry june and jennifer 8 showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise her films with quentin tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity but that came at a price the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch the picture is exceedingly well produced and shot with expensive seeming special effects yet nobody bothered to find the humor in this scenario it's pushy leering ugly and badly cast bloated frozen faced wilson can't tell any of his co workers that he's dating g girl because she made him swear he'd rather have a chainsaw stuck up his rectum i wonder if writer payne actually thought that was hilarious or indeed if anyone involved did from
<START> this was a very well scripted movie great fun if you just want a stupid film not great production value ok the sound really sucked but the performance of danny masterson more than makes up for it br br watch this movie and laugh out loud
<START> i firstly and completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this a spoof crispin glover is very serious about his film he personally introduced the film at the screening i saw in chicago he had worked on the film for years and it is the first in an intended trilogy what is it is crispin glover's attempt at an art film in the vein of those he idolizes by herzog lynch etc br br i had heard rumor of this film years ago epic porno movie with all down syndrome cast directed by crispin glover when it finally came out i watched the trailer on line and read the synopsis and i was foaming at the mouth with anticipation i went to chicago to see it and it was a major disappointment if he took out the goofy sh t such as the pot smoking grandma and the dancing dolls he would be left with something much better but only about 10 minutes long br br in other words just watch the trailer be entertained and leave it at that there are some striking images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases but its lack of focus amounts to disappointment
<START> this film is mediocre at best angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers her bitchy demeanor from law and order carries over in a failed attempt at comedy charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti comedy the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denise's marriage hopefully that effort produces better results
<START> reviewing kazaam and saying it's a bad movie isn't hard at all after all critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film saying it was among the worst films of the decade so the fact that i say it's bad or anyone else says it's bad is certainly no surprise it's like someone talking about wwii practically no one says that was a good thing right the question i have and no place on imdb can answer it is why did they make this in the first place after all it's obvious to anyone who isn't severely brain injured that the film would be horrible but movies like ed a baseball playing chimp cool as ice starring the ever popular vanilla ice troll 2 which doesn't even have any trolls in it baby geniuses einstain like superhero babies and pinocchio in outer space huh prove that any idea no matter how dumb can make it to the big screen so the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright 'normal' br br the film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school like the punk from free willy this kid is somehow 'misunderstood' in other words a total brat and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is by the end of the film he'll have learned something and grown just once i want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film eventually while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him the genie kazaam shaquille o'neal is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes but the kid doesn't believe him and the genie's magic seems a tad rusty br br eventually the brat does realize that kazaam is for real however unlike most kids he withholds making his wishes so in the meantime kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere like his own personal servant and according to the clichÃ© you know that by the end of the film max and kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed oh and max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom's fiancÃ© i'm gonna gag apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes br br as for kazaam shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap very poorly i'm a middle aged white guy and i think i could probably rap at least as well he's an amazing basketball player and i've heard he's a nice guy but a rapper no way as far as his acting goes he wasn't great but had such a nice personality in the film that it's hard to hate him even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things br br so is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you've probably heard through the first two thirds of the movie i would have said no shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script however later in the film the bad becomes horrid as kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he's really needed and out of nowhere the plot gets really really weird as the guy who wants to make kazaam a rap star turns out to be an evil mobster and oddly this guy seems to accept that kazaam is a genie with no hesitation br br in addition the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill max and his dad i know that the kid was annoying but this is supposed to be a kids' film what part of 'trying to kill the kid' didn't the writers not understand then in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug induced hallucination this ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in the black hole and boy did it make my brain hurt uggghh the horrible dialog was just too much to bear br br overall it's a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane yes folks with a messed up message bizarre non kid friendly material and horrible characters this is one wretched film sadly given the idea and actors it's hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse br br by the way if you want to see a genie in a modern world film that is good try the british made for tv film bernard and the genie a charming and exceptionally well written film from start to finish
<START> embarrassingly i just watched this movie for the first time 13 years after its release it's a story that any father or brother can relate to one brother is a bit 'wild ' the other brother is the typical older child craig sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother but pitt is amazing and skerritt is perfectly cast as the father the fishing scenes that were filmed in montana are absolutely breathtaking i had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive the movie closely follows the book with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format unlike most book to movie stories this one measures up it's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie
<START> i am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film and of the few reviews that there are to be positive i saw the movie and was pretty dissapointed i didn't find it very enjoyable at all it was slow and lacks the entertainment value even the murder scenes are lackluster with real close up shots of generic stabbings that don't look good at all and the supposed great twist ending is really not much i did see it coming and then the ending just seemed cliche this movie may not get much mention but by the little that it does get it is overrated i would not recommend this movie
<START> pressburger and powell's greatest movie david niven plays the raf bomber pilot who misses his own death but is granted a second chance at life when heaven notices that he is awol and dispatches an angel to investigate the scene when the young soldiers men and women black and white all killed in action arrive in heaven to be processed for eternal life is unbearably poignant watch out too for roger livesey a deeply under appreciated actor and kim hunter as the love interest later of course zira in planet of the apes incidentally steven spielberg cast the actress who played the chief angel kathleen byron as the elderly wife of the eponymous private in saving private ryan half a century later an act that speaks volumes for his cinematic literacy
<START> child 'sexploitation' is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and i feared that any film on the topic would jump straight to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the audience after having seen both 'trade' and 'holly' one film moved me to want to actually see a change in international laws the other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with emotive music and the odd suicide br br i do not believe that turning this issue into a hollywood tear jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and i must commend the makes of 'holly' for engaging subtly but powerfully with the terrible conditions these children are sadly forced to endure 'trade' wavered between serious and stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat coming after images that represented children being forced to commit some horrendous acts i found this unengaging and at times offensive to the cause if i had wanted a cheap laugh i would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking br br for anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that actually means something i would suggest saving the money on the cinema ticket for the release of 'holly'
<START> to be completely honest i haven't seen that many western films but i've seen enough to know what a good one is this by far the worst western on the planet today first off there black people in the wild west come on who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly no no completely retarded secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns thirdly whats with the asian chick speaking perfect english if the setting is western asia isn't where your going finally the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning now don't get me wrong i'm not racist or white either so don't get ticked after reading this but this movie this movie is the worst presentation of black people i have ever seen
<START> if you are planning to see this movie please reconsider i don't usually post my comments about something i've seen on television but this one was such a waste of my life that i needed to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth critiquing this movie would take far too long as there are so many things wrong with it i will just simply say please do not ever see this movie it was a complete waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours anyone that wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things utterly inept or working for the company that produced it again i guarantee that you will indeed regret seeing this movie
<START> i went on a visit to one of my relatives a while back and we popped by a theatre so we'd thought we'd go in and give this film a go what a mistake this film is awful in every department i'd never heard of the film before and literally everyone still hasn't no wonder this is as rank as it gets it's a comedy so it says well the only thing funny is the ability or lack of it of the director to make such a film getting so close to christmas this should be titled how to under cook a turkey in nearly one and a half hours or however long it was as i walked out at the end of the film you'll come out feeling as though you've been food poisoned on a sick turkey and regret you wasted your time on such dribble who knows why such things get made some people had walked out from the theatre before the film was well over and i blame myself for not walking out a lot earlier it really annoys me that you pay good money to see something decent and all that you come out and see is a poor tv movie that should be showed at 2 o'clock in the morning in fact it's that bad day time tv shouldn't be showing it what else can a say probably not enough bad words could do it justice
<START> until i saw this special on hbo i had never heard of eddie izzard i sure am glad that i have now he is one of the funniest comedians i have ever seen rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then eddie i could not stop laughing for the entire show if you like to laugh you have to see this special
<START> people like me will tear this movie apart it's just not realistic the plot is sooooooo predictable you can anticipate everything that happens convientantly of course they find the treasure and become filthy rich and trick the bad guy we've seen it a million times before the writers of this movie must think that the majority of the movie going public is stupid they must be right because the majority of people actually liked this film i mean solving riddles in a matter of seconds the secret treasure room hidden under the manhattan subway you'd think with all the work that's gone on in new york underground that room would have been discovered before and all that was constructed during the civil war please and the love story between ben and abigail how cute and i thought the romance in clive cussler novels was weak they just fall in love like that in 2 seconds whatever i'd be more concerned with saving my own ass then getting some the hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper 1 10 garbage
