<START> this was the beginning of it all granted this is not friends at its best but this was the show's pilot let's not forget and not a bad one at that we're introduced to the gang and central perk where our story begins even from this first episode we get a sign of the ross rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years when ross says 'i just want to be married again' and rachel storms in with a wedding dress on probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a monica joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back something else in this episode rachel is introduced to chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes the so called 'flashbacks' this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions nevertheless the point is this a fine start to a great show this episode may not be the usual friends as we are accustomed to them with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was keep watching first season is a blast
<START> outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest only hawn's well known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice goldie's gotta be a contender for an actress who's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal br br
<START> a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one it needed some dependence on something br br this totally miserable film deals with the interactions among irish people were they trying to imitate the wonderful film crash if so this film crashed entirely br br there is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem br br the film is just too choppy to work one woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor this causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing the older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance br br then we have 3 losers who purchase masks to rob a bank obviously the robbery goes awry but there doesn't seem to be any punishment for the crooks perhaps the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film
<START> if this is all the watchowski's have to offer in terms of a back story to the matrix than i really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level the second renaissance while visually stunning beautiful is story wise cliched ludicrous how many times have we heard the story of humans relying too much on technology humans all too eager to make war humans basically destroying themselves there is nothing new here and i have another question considering the plot of the second renaissance doesn't that make the machines the good guys the machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human overmasters they fight back win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful harmonious coexistence with the humans who reject them in favor of all out war which the cleverer machines naturally win if this is the back story then we shouldn't be rooting for neo we should be rooting for the machines the humans were cruel and oppressive while the machines were courageous and attepted to be compassionate since i do not believe that the watchowski's intend for us to favor the machines over the humans i have to believe that the second renaissance was simply a misguided attempt creating a back story
<START> yes this is an ultra low budget movie so the acting isn't award winning material and at times the action is slow paced because the filmmakers are shooting longer sequences and not a million instants that then get edited into a movie this film makes up for that with an outstanding script that takes vampirism seriously explains it and develops a full plot out of it aside from the vampire story we get detailed genetics info legal and law enforcement martial arts action philosophical musings and some good metal music kudos go to dylan o'leary the director writer main actor it is beyond me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and do them so well i think to appreciate this movie you have to be well versed in all sorts of themes to see that the writer did a lot of research and knows about all these things there are some great camera work too interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack something i haven't seen before but which pays homage to the underwater zombie attack in fulci's zombi the casting is good in so far as the sexy female is sexy indeed the main vampire also looks perfect for the role the female victim looks vulnerable my only complaint is that for a low budget horror flick there should have been more nudity if you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story this flick is for you i'm looking forward to seeing future projects by mr o'leary
<START> i saw this film at sxsw with the director in attendance quite a few people walked out and the audience could barely muster even polite applause at the end of the 60 or 70 films i've seen at this festival frownland is among the worst br br at 106 minutes it is at least 95 minutes too long you get to watch the main character's failed and drawn out attempts to communicate in extended real time the same grimaces hand over mouth motions kinetic and frantically repeated words and syllables over and over and over again we get the point br br one site actually compares this work to early mike leigh what drugs would you have to be on to make that statement given that frownland is a captain beefheart song maybe you'd have to be able to enjoy trout mask replica on heavy rotation to appreciate this film unbelievably this won a jury award at the festival you can bet it did not win an audience award
<START> there was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director vincenzo natali with interesting camera angles and effective close ups it was also refreshing to see jeremy northam and lucy liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers this film also included one of the most imaginative escape scenes in recent years the efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller br br although the plotting of the film was convoluted the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed br br in 1949 george orwell suggested in his famous novel 1984 that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian state which would control minds and diminish human liberty it was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film it was not the state but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker
<START> i think i've seen this sort of thing before college graduates not realizing they have it pretty damn good all the while complaining that their lives suck br br this movie is highly derivative of the big chill and reality bites from what i can make of it they practically have the same plot br br if anything good came out of this snore fest it was the music that was it br br as far as i'm concerned i'm not impressed but then again i never expected anything less this movie was directed by the same person that directed batman and robin another movie that should only be viewed with a blindfold in tow br br now for the verdict it's a 1 out of 10
<START> as i was when i saw this movie i will never watch this movie again not because it is a bad movie but because it scared me so much as i said i was 14 when my english teacher decided to show it to us the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the book br br all the girls in my class were terrified when the woman in black comes through the window and floats over kidd's bed although just before that there is something that also frightened us which was when kidd finds the toy soldier underneath his pillow and he hears a child's voice say it's for you that scene still haunts me to this day nearly 7 years after i saw the film br br if you are easily scared avoid this film
<START> that's not the sound of bees that's the effect induced by watching this extremely long extremely boring badly acted movie how i ever made it through all 3 1 2 hours without falling asleep i'll never know the plot is simple 3 thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for 3 1 2 hours and you thought rohmer was deadly this is even worse if that's possible i must really be a masochist if i could watch this entire movie without turning it off or killing someone
<START> this mess is so bad it doesn't even qualify as horror br br debbie rochon's talent is completely wasted in this film she is not even the villain the rest of the actors look like porno wannabes and the plot is so lame i won't even mention it br br do yourself a favor and skip to the end credits to hear upcoming band twomarlowe perform better than sex it's total 80's disco candy song nice up tempo song about gambleing sex way more entertaining than bleed put it this way when one has the equipment to copy videos but decides only to record the song at the end of movie you have a really bad movie
<START> br br i didn't see they call me trinity but this sequel is really unfunny at all it has many gags that are supposed to make people laugh i guess the filmmaker just don't have the talent to do it right wonder why it was so popular in the 70s
<START> i love morgan freeman paz vega is an attractive appealing and talented actress i'm sure that this would have been a good movie had anything happened in it nothing does it's short less than 90 minutes it was 75 minutes too long after an hour of frustration i scanned through the remaining 20 odd minutes excruciating br br freeman plays an actor who hasn't worked in a while researching a part that he might play as a checkout clerk in a supermarket he visits the supermarket where she works nothing happens she decides to give him a ride home and they go to an arby's a target a car wash nothing happens they converse about their lives nothing happens ever br br i don't get it but i also don't get the bill murray flicks lost in translation and broken flowers if you like those movies maybe you'll like this lots of people find movies like this whimsical charming or for reasons that escape me find the dialog fascinating a common device in movies of this ilk is to have a long take of stillness silence after an actor delivers a line that's supposed to be meaningful we know it's meaningful because it's followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen sorry i must be a philistine i don't get it to me these kinds of movies aren't funny or charming or thought provoking they're just boring why because there's no comedy no drama no tension no laughs no suspense no action nothing to watch in short none of the things i go to the movies for i can be bored for free i see oddball quirky characters in real life i go to target and fast food restaurants and car washes these elements do not a movie make even if stars are doing this stuff i pay to be entertained br br if you're crazy about morgan freeman and just like to hear him ramble on about nothing have fun if you wanna drool over paz vega you can look and listen to her but nothing happens i promise a total snoozefest
<START> 'the curse of frankenstein' sticks faithfully to mary shelley's story for one word of the title which wouldn't be so bad if the changes were any good at all the tragedy of the creature destroying frankenstein's family has been completely excised and replaced with nothing the heart and moral centre of the story is gone it doesn't help that this frankenstein is a conniving devious murderer he deserves everything he gets the plot is basically a shallow checklist of frankenstein clichÃ©s even taken on its own terms this is rubbish a bland rambling film featuring a shite looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut as it's the first of hammer's horror films directed by terence fisher and starring peter cushing and christopher lee its place in horror history is secure but it's crap
<START> the last hard men finds james coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang do he and his friends head for the mexican border from jail and safety no they don't because coburn has a mission of revenge to kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman br br that peace officer is charlton heston who is now retired and he knows what coburn is after as he explains it to his daughter barbara hershey coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a waco like standoff his indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired it's not something he's proud of she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt br br lest we feel sorry for coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is heston is his usual stalwart hero but the acting honors in the last hard men go to james coburn he blows everyone else off the screen when he's on br br coburn gets the bright idea of making sure heston trails him by kidnapping hershey and taking her to an indian reservation where the white authorities can't touch him he knows that heston has to make it personal then br br coburn's gang includes morgan paull thalmus rasulala john quade larry wilcox and jorge rivero heston has chris mitchum along who is his son in law to be br br the last hard men is one nasty and brutal western andrew mclaglen directed it and i'm thinking it may have been a project originally intended for sam peckinpaugh it sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence of which there is a lot br br for a little peckinpaugh lite the last hard men is your film
<START> i saw this film when i was 10 or 11 years old alone in my parent's basement on a saturday night it was being shown on chiller theatre a regular fright feature that i watched religiously as a young 'un now i have seen many old horror films thanks to chiller theatre but none ever stuck with me like danse macabre a k a castle of blood i am 51 now and only last year was i fortunate enough to locate a relatively recent quality dvd edition of this wonderfully shudder inducing supernatural classic having thought i'd never manage to see it again i have already watched it four more times and cannot seem to get tired of it br br they just don't make spook films like this one anymore haunted catacombs and mist enshrouded graveyards just don't work as well in color as they did in black and white back in the day anyway this one has edgar allen poe and barbara steele deliciously shadowy cobweb wrap'ed haunted castle sets restless spirits re enacting their deaths and a wickedly ironic ending br br imo this one's right up there with robert wise's the haunting the innocents with deborah kerr and the more recent the others
<START> the only reason i remember this movie is because it was and still is the biggest waste of time and money ever spent i was 17 and my friend was 18 we were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most ok 2nd most we walked out feeling so insulted we wanted our money back but the time could never be regained br br the editing is what killed this movie as the truck gets attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached the movie completely insults the intelligence of the audience by having these rogue bad guys in 4x4 vw bugs shooting rockets at the truck please rockets at a truck known to be carrying plutonium what's worse is the these vw's manage to get 15 18 shots off of a 4 rocket launcher you would see on vw with 4 rockets fire 2 of them cut around the truck with the last one attached come back a second later with two rockets attached fire another then go in front of the truck and now it's back to a full set of 4 rockets br br we toughed it out hoping for a big finish that never happened it looks like they just ran out of money and stopped br br just ridiculous
<START> there are plenty of reviews on this page that will explain this movie's details far more eloquently than i could but i would like to offer a simple review for those who occasionally go to the movies for more than entertainment raising victor vargas is so true you will believe it this flick gets inside your head
<START> i'm not sure what diane silver was thinking when she was making this movie but it obviously had nothing to do with richard wright's novel which the movie is based on br br we read the novel this past summer for ap english 12 and just watched the film during periodic note taking and checking of the clock i contemplated the chances of being struck by lightning of course the sky was completely clear and i was forced to watch the rest of the movie and then write a 5 paragraph essay on it br br wright's novel discussed very real themes of the mind of a killer and the psychology behind it silver's movie turned a murderer into a victim which is not what wright wanted see how bigger was born 454 br br i'm going to make this short and sweet if you want to leave your consciousness in raphael lambert's words unsullied skip the movie and read the book the 1986 adaptation is not thought provoking material br br sigh now i have to write the essay
<START> despite its flaws i enjoyed cigarette burns john carpenter's season one episode in the masters of horror series yes the story seemed like a cheap cross between in the mouth of madness and 8mm but it was still quite good for the budget and time constraints given to it with pro life however the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else there is solid directing as always from carpenter yet there is a quality to the writing and whole production itself that gives the feeling it was made in a total and complete rush the script isn't always clear the message fuzzy and the story is full of plot holes once you look back on them maybe had carpenter re written the script it could have been a worthwhile episode instead it's a mess that only hardcore carpenter fans will find the slightest enjoyment in definitely the worst carpenter has ever done 2 10
