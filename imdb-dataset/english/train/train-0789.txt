<START> although the beginning suggests all quiet on the western front this silly and superficial version of war falls far astray of its much better contemporary this depicts the funnest war ever fought with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times br br when we finally see some battle it is lame an enemy plane flies over shoot it down in one shot sniper in the tree kill him before he gets a shot off enemy soldiers in the woods not to worry they gladly surrender ho hum br br tepid turgid predictable br br
<START> this made for tv film is a brilliant one this is probably the best and favourite role by bafta winning john thaw kavanagh q c and inspector morse tom oakley thaw widowed man has lived in a village alone for a while since his wife and son died and now he has been landed with an evacuee called willaim beech nick robinson as he gets to know this child he starts to develop a friendship until willaim's mum annabelle apsion wants him back after tom gets worried about william not contacting him he goes to london to find him in the end willaim gets his home with a loving family or dad set during the second world war this is an excellent film it was nominated the bafta lew grade award and it won the national television award for most popular drama john thaw was number 3 on tv's 50 greatest stars very good
<START> an apparent vanity project for karin mani who as a hottie charles bronson going around wiping up the 'scum' that mugged her parents or grandparents or something and impressing young hunks with her karate skills in a pivotal scene she intervenes to stop a rape and a moron cop throws her in jail so after a couple cool shower scenes and some abortive prison dyke seduction she has to take the law into her own hands blah blah blah i guess there were a lot of movies like this the script is dumber than usual if you can believe that mani comes off as exactly the kind of showbiz type that would co produce her own death wish starring role and i find that type sporadically endearing but the movie is an ungainly apparatus competent actors would be wasted on the scumbag roles here and would actively undermine the fantastic mincing incompetent da and a judge that has got to be the producer's uncle
<START> it's not a big film the acting is not amazing some sub charterers are even played badly the film is not beautiful in any sense nothing really inventive or new if you like big films this one is not for you yet it has a big really big plus on the story larry's story works because we know this story from our own lives the girl we didn't ask to a date the test we've failed the friend we let down are all in our history this movie works because it touch it it's a great story because it's a small one it's the life we all have with regrets we all have and yet the message hits every life we could have lived would have had their downside the first time i watched it i was 15 it was shown in a party at my school 16 years later i keep reflecting on it every once in a while and every time i see it it puts a smile on my face watch it it will do you good you'll be happier with what you have
<START> the acting in this movie was superb as an amateur rocketeer i found very few mistakes as a human being it touched my heart and soul to watch the actors you would think that they are the actual characters laura dern a favorite actress of mine left nothing out of her performance the young actors playing the rocket boys showed talent beyond their years especially young homer homer's father inspired that eternal love hate relationship between a father and son so that it felt real if you don't get a lump in your throat or shed a tear when that first successful rocket goes up or when father and son come to terms then get your pulse checked you may be dead
<START> gorgeous barbara bach plays jennifer fast a television reporter who travels with her crew karen lamm and lois young to solvang california to cover a danish festival the problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full so they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly ernest keller a phenomenal sydney lassick wouldn't you know it ernest and meek partner virginia lelia goldoni are hiding a big secret in their cellar pitiable deformed diaper clad junior stephen furst in a remarkable performance who ultimately terrorizes the girls br br a deliciously unhinged lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie it builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation climax delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour the hotel and the foreboding cellar large echoes of psycho here are great settings most of all the perverse plot involves incest and patricide allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality and yet it also becomes poignant as we realize junior is no one dimensionally evil bogeyman but as much a victim as the girls the final shot is especially sad br br the unseen is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery br br 8 10
<START> all you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes it looks cool it has a solid original soundtrack reflective of the late 60s period and all but a couple of its characters are unlikeable once you get that message you may as well switch to another film br br davies's protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend one of the few people in his life who cares about him then by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real world instead of living a fantasy film of which he's the imagined director he does so by pushing her aside and pairing up with an actress he's idealized beyond reason a couple laughs and some thoughtful art direction are the only things worth watching here br br the film is also interesting as documentation of jason schwartzman's fall from mount rushmore in rushmore schwartzman's annoying brattiness was something to be overcome but here it's his character's only quality schwartzman's family connection clearly landed him in this role here's hoping his choices improve
<START> considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films i have no argument with that although there are a couple of others i thought just as entertaining one thing it's the longest of the series that i've seen at 105 minutes i've only seen six of them but this was longer than i'm used to and with the drawn out action finale i thought the whole thing was a bit too long br br nonetheless it is a good mixture of action suspense and romance the only things missing are color and stereo sound the primitive special effects don't bother me as that was all that they had back in the 1930s br br among some this film is most noted for one thing skin jane never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the hays' code was instituted by the time the next tarzan film was made her outfit showed what a great figure maureen o'sullivan possessed the nude underwater scene however was not her by a longshot the woman under the water didn't have a good figure at all whoever it was br br there is plenty of action in here up to the finale it was not overdone either the ending went on for 15 minutes though and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch br br still this movie offers about everything except boy their adopted son you'd want to see in a tarzan film even o'sullivan doing her tarzan yell about a dozen times with her pair of lungs that was no problem
<START> how can anyone not love this movie i think it's a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies if you've never seen them watch this instead michael keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes one guy mangles the english language everytime he talks and griffin dunn plays a clueless d a but my favorite role has got to be joe piscopo he has all the best lines danny devito alan hale ray walston are in this star studded movie that lampoons gangsters a lot funnier than mafia did for the criminal underground
<START> ultra grim crime drama from pou soi cheang the director of home sweet home tonally it reminded me of billy tang's run and kill although it's not as polished as that nevertheless it's an engaging flawed bit of mayhem about a cambodian loner pang edison chen who arrives in hong kong to kill a lawyer while fleeing the scene he kills the partner of cop sam wai who to add insult to injury is in the midst of dealing with his dying father so sam begins an insane obsessive manhunt for pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence there must be something in the air lately because i've never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as i have lately this is grim nasty stuff which is why i'm so partial to it and i applaud its downbeat vibe it's visually arresting and the sound design is very unique dramatically everything spirals downwards until every character finds him or herself in a world of screaming pain a subplot involving pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine act of grotesque surgery
<START> i first saw this movie when it originally came out i was about 9 yrs old and found this movie both highly entertaining and very frightening and unlike any other movie i had seen up until that time br br basic plot an expedition is sent out from earth to the fourth planet of altair a great mainsequence star in constellation aquilae to find out what happened to a colony of settlers which landed twenty years before and had not been heard from since br br theme an inferior civilization namely ours comes into contact with the remains of a greatly advanced alien civilization the krell 200 000 years removed the seed of destruction from one civilization is being passed on to another unknowingly at first the theme of this movie is very much good vs evil br br i first saw this movie with my brother when it came out originally i was just a boy and the tiger scenes really did scare me as did the battle scenes with the unseen creature force i was also amazed at just how real things looked in the movie br br what really captures my attention as an adult though is the truth of the movie forbidden knowledge and how relevant this will be when we do if ever come into contact with an advanced alien civilization far more developed than we ourselves are presently advanced technology and responsibility seem go hand in hand we must do the work for ourselves to acquire the knowledge along with the wisdom of how to use advanced technology this is in my opinion the great moral of the movie br br i learned in graduate school that knowledge is power is at best in fact not correct knowledge is potential power depending upon how it is applied if it is applied at all it's not what you know but how you use what you know br br the overall impact of this movie may well be realized sometime in mankind's own future that is knowledge in and of itself is not enough we must must have the wisdom that knowledge depends on to truly control our own destiny or we will end up like the krell in the movie just winked out br br many thanks to those who responded to earlier versions of this article with comments and corrections they are all very much appreciated i hope you are as entertained by this story as much as i have been over the past 40 years br br rating 10 out 10 stars
<START> this is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement from the very start i was utterly hooked into the true story when lt viktor burakov stephan rea weeps while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies this then is the compelling story of andrei chikatilo wonderfully played by jeffrey demunn the green mile in fact he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him until we remember what he is the psychiatrist dr alexandr bukhanovsky wonderfully played by max von sydow was utterly believable in every detail and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the soviet union is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local communist commissar bondarchuk played by joss ackland for me though the outstanding performance was from donald sutherland proving once again what a superb character actor he really is i was almost in tears when he told burakov how the fbi had so closely followed and admired his work this film puts silence of the lambs into the shade from the atmospheric and bleak soviet landscape to the superlative performances by everyone involved br br i rate this film 10 10
<START> one note comedy that probably sets modern day feminists' teeth on edge department store clerk betsy drake is in love with the idea of babies and marriage pinning her hopes on women's magazines until she spies super bait in the form of sleek bachelor cary grant the rest of the film plods from one ploy to the next as the relentless drake pursues her quarry i guess the word perky just about sum's up drake's approach to the role she does have a charming smile but after 20 minutes of memorizing her dentures i began to overdose grant's role is basically secondary and minus his usual flair there is one scene however that almost salvages this slender exercise drake queries the hapless grant following his lecture to a roomful of respectable ladies here her perky manner has an unforced freshness that is really quite remarkable and had the production not rubbed our noses in that upbeat grin for 90 minutes the film might have amounted to more than a girls' camp day dream circa 1948
<START> this is not michael madsen's fault he was hardly in it this movie was just awful if you want to laugh and be bored go ahead and watch this movie words cannot describe how idiotic it is sorry michael the cinematography was dark all the other actors are unknowns when watching it it feels like a soft porn but with no nudity or heated scenes this movie had sexual overtones since it is about a underground s m killer the acting was bad except michael madsen's parts he looked like he wanted to laugh i hope he got paid well for this lousy movie it is something i would not be proud of it is not even a b movie for cable it is more like a f and it should never be shown ever
<START> playing a character from a literary classic can be a bit of a poisoned chalice for an actor paying for the pleasure of a meaty character by competing with the fantasies of generations of readers Â not to mention the numerous other actors who've besieged the castle before fortunately for the fantasists this version Â with the nicely cast zelah clarke and timothy dalton Â stands head and shoulders above versions that have come after it it's the right length to do the story full justice and makes considerable use of bronte's cracking dialogue none of that modern meddling away cutting text and adding new and inferior scenes br br the magic of the original story lies in the tensions created between the central characters and the lives circumstances create for them to lead jane Â poor plain and little Â grows up on the stinting charity of a cold aunt her nature and independence shaped by a long spell in a very harsh school she arrives as a governess in the household of mr rochester utterly friendless and alone she represses herself habitually out of duty and hard experience but her passionate nature soon finds its touch paper in her stern keenly intelligent enigmatic master to whom she is drawn as he is to her by forces beyond their control rochester is the caged tiger busy paving hell with energy potentially dangerous to all who come into contact with him Â but pervious through a chink or two his character is extraordinary he takes extraordinary liberties with a paid subordinate but then jane is no ordinary employee as he sees but a dark secret and severe trials lie before them both br br it's a pleasure to hear bronte's remarkable dialogue spoken by such accomplished actors Â dalton in particular seems formed for passion on a brontean scale if you've only ever seen him as a not so memorable bond you've missed the thing he's best at those who've commented that his rochester is too handsome miss the point of these dramatisations his character has simply too much screen time for a really ugly man to retain the viewer's attention timothy dalton is just right not always or consistently handsome but often glancingly strikingly so just as it should be and zelah clarke's jane is no wallflower she conveys the emotions of a woman who habitually represses her sense of humour and her passionate nature very successfully allowing her rare outbursts to show to more dramatic effect br br not so long ago the bbc aired an excellent dramatisation of jean rhys' enlightened and most unsettling riposte to bronte wide sargasso sea imagining the back story of the first mrs rochester do check it out Â you'll never see the 'hero' of jane eyre in quite the same way again
<START> i screamed my head off because seeing this movie was my first movie going experience ever at some 13 months old i remember it being incredibly bloody and it made me angry i watched it again on tv a few years ago big mistake the acting is wooden the plot non existent and the movie lacks merit unless 23 year old t a is what gets you going 0
<START> jungle fever is too highly stylized stereotyped and comes across as essentially dishonest wesley snipes was wrong for the lead and there was no chemistry between him and annabella sciorra even though there's plenty of talent in this movie it's mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos also instead of simply showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing it is spike lee chooses to wave it around like a flag in a most whining and irritating manner i made it through most of the film but i couldn't quite finish it and that for me rarely happens
<START> light spoiler alert the story sounds good and if you've read the novel then you're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships br br true enough the script tries to do that the director tries to do that but the main cast fails miserably maria's acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever her most intense moments seem almost comical sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend br br ioana seems even more tense than maria and even worse she doesn't seem natural at all maria had the attitude even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious but she had it and her character received some credibility and to make matters worse we don't have an insight on her where does she come from how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship how did the relationship evolve we only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to 'be' there it has a content and and end but no beginning just like her partner maria she has only once scene that is truly touching the scene where she dumps maria's character kiki br br tudor is the only person in this movie aside from the landlady great acting there who manages to prove some acting talent he has his character's attitude and it fits him only once or twice he seems to falter the scene at his parents' meal he tries to be obvious when it wasn't necessary at all br br i love the story tudor chirila is ok there the landlady actually acts and puya delivers his couple of lines with style but this doesn't save the movie too bad the entire setting had huge potential and the romanian cinematography could've used a movie on this theme br br oddly enough the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no background no feeling well maria's spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction lesbian relationship of maria and ioana i'm quite sorry for spending money on a ticket i'd rather had watched it from the comfort of my room
<START> anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies this film is riveting and doesn't have a boring moment why because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis i repeat intelligent dialogue that is what characterizes nearly all of rohmer's films and that is why a lot of people don't like them they prefer action fine let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out films like this br br rohmer has always been accused of being talky well he is but to me that's a compliment not a criticism shakespeare was talky too is there a talkier play than hamlet whenever the subject or theme of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values an that is largely what this film is all about aristocracy and noble birth vs egalitarianism loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life even if the person possessing that life is not so nice or even despicable anyone ever hear of dostoyevsky or crime and punishment these are what this film is all about br br the two leads in this film are impeccable as if they were born to play these roles lucy russell who is english and speaks french as her second language is especially brilliant do yourself a favor and see this riveting film it may be the last film by this screen master
<START> jet li is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world he has been for over 20 years and he puts others in the genre to shame while he is big in asia he is almost unknown here in the us br br black mask is supposed to be a breakout movie for him but it fails horribly first of all it is dubbed while it may have camp value the dubbing isn't even close and it is flat in tone it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer secondly the director in this movie daniel lee does a horrible job he cuts scenes so fast at times you don't know what's going on other times the camera shakes and wobbles fans see jet li's movies for the fantastic martial arts however the director edits the scenes so fast that you don't even know who's who half the time other times a scene is left hanging ie li is beginning to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep while the badguys arm their guns two seconds later both li and the love interest are already under the car other scenes are so improbable that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous killer cd roms just give him throwing stars li needs a director who is less prone to machine gun cutting and more to creating a cinematic mise a scene the added rap techno music goes from being okay to intrusive the plot has possibilities but are all squandered by cartoonish characters that take away from any credibility that this movie strives for and are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize simon because he has a half mask on wouldn't the hair lower jaw or voice give it away br br if you want to see a jet li movie try iron monkey or his classic shaolin temple this disjointed mess is a complete waste of time 2 10
