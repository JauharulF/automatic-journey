<START> i've been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line wasn't good at all the play of the actors weren't any better br br of course shahrukh khan was there yet he wasn't enough to make this movie credible and interesting br br i've read that this movie was based on the novel of flaubert madame bovary yet for me i didn't see it matching with the indian mentality br br in general we buy movie to dream and have a good time not to waste our time and change our mood into worse i just can't understand how it could get such a high vote with an average of 6 8 10 br br so it's the kind of movie you should run away ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it you will just waste your time unless if you like dark movie with strange and non sense story
<START> i'm a fan of c c going back to their records and liked this movie but at one point in the mid 1980's on cable television in san jose california it was aired with an alternate plot line that destroyed the entire point of the movie all references to marijuana were replaced with diamonds the bag that red drops to chong has diamonds in it instead of marijuana but the conversation still remains the same it's worth 3000 lb there is also a subplot in which clips of aliens on a ship were added observing c c and talking to each other about getting the diamonds at the end instead of space coke it's something else i'm not sure who created this version but it was horrible and obvious that they were attempting to make it family child friendly it would have been better if that network had not aired it at all

<START> this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival but unlike yes by sally potter which i had seen some days before where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive this time quite the opposite thing happened there was something that dragged me down and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe it was as if all of a sudden there was nothing left all hope all future had been taken away to a dead place br br nina's life seemed to be dismal and locked but then one lovely day there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion just out of nothing someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life that person was toni a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots just like herself br br but the film's title is ghosts and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish there is no way to retain themÂ ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself hiding away from all other people franÃ§oise a french woman is a victim of such ghosts she once lost her child daughter in berlin who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket in just one moment of inattentiveness now time has passed and franÃ§oise is back in berlin still looking for the missing child br br nina could be that child after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heart shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identity br br and nina adopts that idea after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion she also longs for a mother but in the end she is empty handed toni has disappeared with a man and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman marie is dead concludes franÃ§oise's husband and the statement could not be more disillusioning nina is just a niÃ±a a girl without name there is no hope for any divine fulfillment there is no marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives therefore in the end we see nina all alone about to walk along the road that has opened up before her into a future that seems joyless and uncertain
<START> this film story is bad enough which can happen in real life i'm very can not understand when they show us this bad film i say it was bad because there is some reason 1 if madonna was rich and can do everything she want then why she falling in love with that bad man 2 how can the story script is so weak she was so rich can do everything she want but not dare to divorce her husband that is very impossible br br the words i love you it doesn't meant anything in this film
<START> well now that i know where rob zombie stole the title for his house of 1 000 corpses crapfest i can now rest in peace nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in the house of seven corpses but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot ha anyway to kill the bloody amateurs making a low rent horror flick in his former abode in hell house sorry i don't remember the actual name of the residence a bunch of mysterious unexplained deaths took place long ago some like arthritic lurch stand in john carradine whose small role provides the film's only worthwhile moments attribute it to the supernatural bellowing film director john ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum the result comes across like satan's school for girls catchy title made for tv production values intriguing plot crossed with children shouldn't play with dead things low rent movie about low rent movie makers who wake the dead trouble is it's nowhere near as entertaining or fun the house of seven corpses is dead at frame one and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis dragging us along for every aching second
<START> i was true to my regard for mr glover and ms goldberg i watched the entire film with my family and some friends i have no idea what the movie was about after much discussion we all agreed that this was not one of their better efforts br br it doesn't hang together very well it is too choppy and there is little comedy i am disappointed it could have been much better br br i waited months to see this film based on the liner notes br br don't waste your money unless you are a completist and just want to see all of mr glover's and ms goldberg's films br br it was a poor way to spend an evening
<START> house of games is definitely not without its flaws plot holes stiff acting final scenes but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head house of games does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do of course this is not a huge feat given the fact that we're dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate so it stands to reason that we never really know what's going on even though we think that we do but that's what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities br br it has a definite hitchcock slant to it the film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort marnie considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the master's more thought provoking works one could easily consider the idea of lindsay crouse's character being the same as tippi hedrin's ten year later perhaps both are strong willed loners both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool as crouse's repressed up tight character says what's life without adventure put your reality check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks
<START> i was not expecting the powerful filmmaking experience of girlfight it's an indie low budget no big name actors freshman director i had heard it was good but not this good br br placed in a contemporary ethnic working class brooklyn karyn kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the day do day struggles of urban latinos diana the protagonist is seething with anger and lashes out at her high school peers getting in trouble with the school and her friends she is being raised by her single father who appears to love her and her brother but applies a strict sex based double standard on his children the father's double standard is illustrated by the fact that tiny the brother is taking boxing lessons at the local gym but diana is denied similar pursuits on an errand to the gym to meet tiny diana is captivated by boxing tiny doesn't like boxing so he and diana trade places he gets the money from dad then gives it to diana to take the lessons in his place br br this is actually a feel good movie as diana grows and learns about herself through boxing meets a guy and addresses some very serious issues head on there's no giggly 'everything that can go right does go right' resolution a la bend it like beckham the reality and attendant personal issues are too big for pat resolutions but in my opinion girlfight is a better and more satisfying film for it
<START> true fans of film will love this authentic movie br br i disagree with the trolls who are rating this movie a one star and calling it unrealistic while i don't have the background or come from the environment of the protagonists i've spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feel the acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave i don't know what the basis is for others' comments that the film is unrealistic the dialog is great br br the low budget production value didn't bother me a bit i felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film the focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy hollywood propping or melodrama br br i completely bought into the character's motivations and reactions the acting was believable and impressive for new and non actors br br if your idea of good film is transformers or fast furious then skip it if you enjoy good character driven dramas then see it br br regarding the negative commenters being trolls click on their names and you will see most have no other reviews or only negative reviews
<START> i admit it's very silly but i've practically memorized the damn thing it holds a lot of good childhood memories for me my brother and i saw it opening day and i have respect for any movie with fnm on the soundtrack
<START> it's very very funny you know just like a comedy is supposed to be it also looks very very good like a hollywood spectacular should so what more do you want howz about a very very good sally fields she is so much better here than in anything else i've ever seen her in and she looks so damn good this movie is all you need to understand why she's a star those eyes like a silent movie star but better in fact everyone's eyes are so good i used to pretend to be a bad tv soap actor with my girlfriend we'd do that thing where you look real fast from one eye to the other of your partner they don't do that at all in soap dish great the eyes have it sorry br br there's so many terrific performances its fun just waiting for each of them to reappear there's a whole workshop going on with kevin kline on how to overact very very subtly got that yeah he's damn good so is robert downey jr who has since made sumthin of a career of playing the slick slimy executive cathy moriarity while not the most gifted actress is so charismatic and riveting especially when she's angry and even whoopi goldberg is decent her natural timing giving here somewhat flat delivery a little zing ok no whoopi bashing i hear ya br br and then there's the hair soap dish was made at the end of the big hair eighties so the ridiculous doos are like a great character in themselves they get bigger and sillier just like your's did yeah we got pictures br br soap dish is better than i thought it'd be better that i wanted it to be i'm sick of movies that tell me i'm supposed to care about shallow self centered semi talented egomaniacs ie tv soap actors soap dish seems happy just to have me laugh at 'em thank you
<START> it is not obvious from viewing this film so i recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it but this presentation on the realities of islam and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non muslims is lacking objectiveness and also completely fails to factor in the human condition it is one thing to document that the koran says many things about how a devout muslim is required to interact with non muslims but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of islam will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system there is reason to call much about the presenters into question such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism don't swallow it all hook line and sinker without some thinking of your own br br one specific for instance is researching the person walid shoebat who claims to be a former muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in bethlehem there are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions i am not nor have i ever been a muslim i have never read the koran i am not a christian nor a member of any faith but i am an intelligent and discerning human while the film is quite disturbing in its presentation of how some muslims view their obligation to islam i remind you that there is more to islam than the views of the fundamentalists just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical christians so too there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among jews and muslims br br when you watch this film you need to have the salt shaker on hand one grain will not be enough you'll need more please use your own mind and think for yourself research what is presented and evaluate the state of the world and how islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video there is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together indicating a definite bias be your own brain
<START> don't spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the guise of cinematography when every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers leaves a lot to be said i was expecting something better from award winning actor benicio del toro the vision that others may have of puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as maldeamores a foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context see the movie elsa and fred for example but it should not permeate the plot the movie is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film
<START> camp with a capital c think of mask and the ace ventura movies then multiply by 100 this laugh a minute entertainer takes schlock to the level of high art david dhawan is a genius and govinda is beyond description see it over and over again i insist
<START> lage raho munnabhai is really a disappointing movie i have seen the first part of munnabhai and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u br br this movie really waste yours time and money i went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema hall br br role of circuit was very small n useless n this movie i think sanjay dutt cut down the role of arshad varshi br br character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one this movie show u the result of over confidence br br the ideas of mahatma is also not define and confusing br br a really very big disappointment
<START> this movie starts out with an execution of a practitioner of witchcraft and his mistress his head is chopped off and buried separately of his body sounds like the thing that wouldn't die doesn't it well it does play out a little like that but once the body is reunited with the head all the interesting and gruesome deaths are done and the movie moves very slowly i mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and i kept thinking when is it going to end the characters in the movie are idiots for the most part and they pretty much deserve to die for being really stupid the villain is also very bad as he is slow moving and really you wonder how he manages to do anything considering he is afraid of jewelery the only thing to keep you watching after the head is reattached is the fact that there are so many boobs being flashed that you really begin to lose track still i want to see a horror movie not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie it is way to slow moving with way to many slow stretches to be even somewhat enjoyable and don't read the back of the box as it made it out like there were flesh eating zombies attacking the town there isn't only a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily repelled they are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene is rather pointless so for the most part i say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it for really cheap
<START> nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing this time it's being brought to you by the never inevitable fred olen ray as far as exploitation movies go this one doesn't click as science fiction it's plain unoriginal all that we see is an an ugly feminine android wearing a bikini out to destroy the earth and showing off all that's nearly bare to resist give me a f ing break if this kind of entertainment is your thing then why not dust off those old si swimsuit mags from the attic for a change this would have been much better if it didn't set the sleaze factor on very high but that still wouldn't make this one great i'd like to point out another film called the assault 1996 by jim wynorski which resembles the identity of alienator it illustrates why top notch 1st person femme fatale action movies don't translate well in america sorry fellas
<START> this movie was amazing it is the kind of movie where you watch it and rather than look at other movies by actor you look at other movies by director writer sandler did a good job working a character outside of his comfort zone and the always good cheadle did a great job too this movie is great for a mature intelligent audience the acting was fantastic and can only be surpassed by the writing and directing of the film this film focuses on the real americans the past generation no stereotypes or racism just people who have come together and realized the true meaning of life this film is about loss and coping instead of picking on psychiatry it defines it not as someone who heals you magically but rather through the necessity of talking out your feeling to an impartial someone you can trust will not judge you but rather will guide you though your thoughts this movie is all round amazing
<START> although the film is the adaptation of the french play forgot the name sorry it is a wonderful portrayal of the cheerful side of georgian character this film will make you to burst into laughter and will fill your heart with warm sadness it will display the overwhelming love of life along with human eccentricities
