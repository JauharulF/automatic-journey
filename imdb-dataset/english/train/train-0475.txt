<START> well vivah is quite a good but typical sooraj barjatya's movie it shows different aspects of indian families wedding ceremonies etc the movie is more than good but not extremely good br br the big plus point of the movie is direction music and shahid and amrita's acting especially the last scene the movie starts with a common factor of indian movie a girl being disliked by her step mother story is the movie is a bit common but it is good good enough to make the movie a blockbuster br br minus point is common story of bollywood movie overall i would say it is two times must watch movie if you want to see typical indian family values and of course love
<START> ok so i just saw the movie although it appeared last year i thought that it was generally a decent movie except for the storyline which was stupid and horrible first of all we never get to know anything about the creatures why they appeared wtf are they doing in our world and really have they been on earth before we were or did they just come from space secondly the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created really how large could the underground for a sub station could have been there were only so many of those creatures so i think instead of killing innocent people in vain they could have just planted some tactical bombs or maybe clear the are and a nuke would have done the job i know it sounds funny and it is but i do not see the killing of people as being necessary thirdly leon acts like superman jumping on the train and fighting vinnie jones who was way taller and bigger in stature then again when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a wimp watching all the abominations i mean ok the conductor had creepy help lol but if leon was so brave he would have gone all the way i mean he risks his life first then does nothing exactly when he should have he could have died as a hero but lives as a coward this might be the case but not after showing so much braveness earlier on then the cop thing come on this was a city having a subway i bet there must have been other cops except that lady other police stations this was really kind of silly all in all great acting by vinnie jones interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all by the way what did the signs on the chest mean vinnie jones cannot make up for the rest
<START> horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn't always win out over imagination we all know that killers like freddy jason michael and even leatherface shouldn't be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day most of us don't believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains and let's hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them this is where imagination wins out over fact horror and most films in general requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow this usually isn't a problem when i watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at george c scott or when i see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near burketsville but what i do have a problem digesting without wanting to regurgitate is when a film has a killer like the one in this film to give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself but just suffice to say that i actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed there are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is but the 90 minutes prior to this point is a well done suspenseful blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by john hough if the film would have offered me a different killer then i would actually be raving about it this may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film but believe me anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me br br john cassevetes plays dr sam cordell he and his daughter jenny played beautifully by erin flannery have just recently moved to this small new england town cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died we see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman one can only presume it is his wife is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed again i am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway cassevetes it has to be mentioned is strange to say the least cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental there are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities it never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy br br casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor john leslie and screen great james caan he has a deceptive smile and a virile commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice but he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene he just has that slimy disingenuous phlegmatic uneasy way about him he never really looks like he can be trusted in this film i guess that is a credit to the writers the director and to cassevetes himself there was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get go br br the story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry there is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see something or someone is watching them when the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck the young woman wanders into the shed just to play a prank once she is there she is attacked the young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in he looks frantically scours the room and spots his would be lover bleeding in the corner and then smacko the guy gets it it is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note br br also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place he has another dream toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of galen br br throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped this is my first feeble and careful attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement it just didn't strike the right chord br br the incubus is a well done film it is tense tight and even most of the performances are very well done i was intrigued by the dreams that tim was having and i was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders but when you get through all that was good in the film you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth and bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones br br 7 out of 10 this could have been a nine too bad
<START> for two of the funniest comedians the movie was awful fast forwarded it and never got any better waste of time and waste of money tina fey is such a great writer i thought that she would be so great in the comedy the previews were so great but they only showed the best parts of the movie my husband even thought that for a chick flick it sucked what is up with that movie was very slow ans boring i will not recommend it to anyone at this time i would like my money back for this one boo from us here in arizona thanks but no thanks who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant i thought that it was going to be so funny i have had my own children and i have helped others have children it could have been more along the lines of reality
<START> if any show in the last ten years deserves a 10 it is this rare gem it allows us to escape back to a time when things were simpler and more fun filled with heart and laughs this show keeps you laughing through the three decades of difference the furniture was ugly the clothes were colorful and the even the drugs were tolerable the hair was feathered the music was accompanied by roller skates and in the words of merle haggard a joint was a bad place to be take a trip back to the greatest time in american history fall in love with characters and the feel good essence of the small town where people were nicer to each other this classic is on television as much as full house don't miss it and always remember to shake your groove thing
<START> sorry gave it a 1 which is the rating i give to movies on which i walk out or fall asleep in this case i fell asleep 10 minutes from the end really really bored and not caring at all about what happened next
<START> br br whether any indictment was intended must be taken into consideration if in the year 2000 there were still rifts of feeling between caucasian and afro americans in georgia such as shown in this film obviously there remains a somewhat backward mentality among a lot of people out there it is rather hypocritical to say the least if everyone adores halle berry whoopie goldberg beyoncÃ© noemi campbell denzel washington will smith et al whilst out in the backs there persist manifest racial divides br br white grandmother suddenly gets black grand daughter thrust upon her only to meet up with black grandfather in a very white social backwater the story is sweet not lacking tragic overtones and eminently predictable as in most of these kinds of tv films though the final scene has you guessing will he won't he br br gena rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere rendering and louis gossett is a good match for her the little penny bae fortunately does not steal the show br br a nice' way of relaxing after sunday lunch without having to force your mind too much though you might just find yourself having a little siesta in the middle of it
<START> ah yes the 1980s a time of reaganomics and sly chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies at the time i couldn t believe how movies like rambo missing in action and uncommon valor and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn made money at the box office they re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly troma s war is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place of course not troma s war lacks any sort of sophistication though it does make the point that there s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up maybe it is
<START> vincent price's follow up to house of wax 1953 the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon similarly revolves around a bitter Â albeit resourceful Â showman though a remake the former shot in technicolor remains the superior effort that said apart from some resistible comic relief the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry it was another 3 d showcase and occasional narrative shortcomings whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head this offers more than enough grand guignol type thrills and overall camp value price hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating 'missing' star conjurers who had taken advantage of his genius to stand on its own two feet incidentally director brahm's involvement here proves no mere coincidence Â since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles both starring laird cregar he had previously helmed i e the lodger 1944 and hangover square 1945 the young leads are played by mary murphy as price's ingÃ©nue assistant and patrick o'neal as her police detective boyfriend Â curiously enough he would himself take the lead in a similar piece chamber of horrors 1966 which i have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this one an interesting sideline here is the latter's adoption of a novel detection technique fingerprinting which is crucial in bringing about price's downfall in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climax Âthough the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run watching the star in a made to measure role the film emerges a good deal of fun Â particularly at a compact 73 minutes
<START> this film was shot on location in gerard gardens in liverpool and was the uk's answer to films such as 'blackboard jungle' the film stands the test of time quite well with all the moral stories still or even more relevant today the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actors such as david mccallum stanley baker peter cushing and anne heywood baker plays a liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age they will end up being responsible adults br br notable cameos in the film include freddie starr fred fowell and melvyn hayes gloria tsai chin and michael chow play brother and sister they are real life brother and sister who are caught up in an arsonists web tsai chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film 'the interpretor' br br violent playground features a gun siege in a school so is unlikely to be shown on tv following similar events in scotland russia br br i lived in gerard gardens where the film was shot though was not born at the time and have fond memories of the area i have recently completed a documentary on gerard gardens which includes extracts from 'violent playground' and a small uk film 'coast to coast' which stars lenny henry and pete postlewaite the tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive br br there were some complaints from the residents when the film was released as the film portrayed the area in a bad light time has helped heal those wounds br br a little gem of a film i would recommend you seek this out
<START> i checked this one out on dvd for a dollar so i could easily smile as this dreadful movie unfolds every time that you think it cannot get any worse it inevitably does the acting is absolutely horrific the plot makes no sense at all the title cold vengeance in the us dvd version has absolutely nothing to do with the script the action scenes are so obviously taken in their first take there are lots of mistakes during dialogues indicating that there is just no intend to do another take to at least try to make this movie bearable i cannot remember having seen a worse movie and i do occasionally get bad ones well except for unstoppable with wesley snipes no who am i kidding while a bad one unstoppable deserves best picture awards at the oscars when compared to this piece of crap
<START> i understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent i have sat through many movies that don't particularly hold my interest but i can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children's activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in children's movies disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their name br br technically the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds over dubbed and unnatural personally i hate that but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project the acting reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices thankfully it was a very short movie br br now before i come off like a video geek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick the one thing that can save even the worst children's movie is a positive message far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given br br if you are lost don't worry you will inevitably find your way home br br approach wild animals without any fear br br you can win any competition just because you know you can br br and my favorite the final message left in the film br br it's okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right
<START> despite being released on dvd by blue underground some five years ago i have never come across this italian sword and sorcery item on late night italian tv and now that i have seen it for myself i know exactly why not because of its director's typical predilection for extreme gore of which there is some examples to be sure or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time it is set in the dark ages after all Âit is quite simply very poor stuff indeed in fact i would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that i have yet seen and believe me i have seen plenty especially in the last few years i e following my excursion to the 2004 venice film festival reading about how the film's failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its director's subsequent and regrettable career nosedive into mindless low budget gore i can see their point i may prefer fulci's earlier giallo period 1968 77 to his more popular stuff horror 1979 82 myself but even on the latter his commitment was arguably unquestionable on the other hand conquest seems not to have inspired fulci in the least Â seeing how he decided to drape the proceedings with an annoyingly perpetual mist sprinkle it with incongruent characters cannibals vs werewolves anyone irrelevant gore we are treated to a gratuitous nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesh eating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists and even some highly unappetizing intimacy between the masked brain slurping villainess don't ask and her slimy reptilian pet for what it is worth we have two heroes for the price of one here a young magic bow carrying boy on some manhood affirming odyssey andrea occhipinti and his rambling muscle bound companion jorge rivero i e frenchy from howard hawks' rio lobo 1970 who despite being called mace short for maciste perhaps seems to be there simply to drop in on his cavewoman from time to time and get his younger protÃ©gÃ© out of trouble particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the 'boils' unfortunately even the usual saving grace of such lowbrow material comes up short here as ex goblin claudio simonetti's electronic score seems awfully inappropriate at times fulci even contrives to give the film a laughably hurried coda with the surviving beefy hero going aimlessly out into the wilderness after defeating one and all with the aid of the all important magic bowÂso much for his own supposed physical strength onto his next Â and thankfully unfilmed Â adventure
<START> yes awa wrestling how can anyone forget about this unreal show first they had a very short interviewer named marty o'neil who made rock n roll buck zumhofe look like a nose tackle then it was gene okerland who when he got mad as the wrestler would say either were out of time or well be right back acting like he was mad but actually sounding forced after he went to the wwf ken resneck took over even though his mustache looked like week old soup got stuck to it was a very fine interviewer who georgeous jimmy garvin called mouse face which made me fall off my chair laughing after he jumped ship then larry nelson came on board which he was so bad that phyllis george would of been an improvement then there's doug mcleod the best wrestling announcer ever who made every match exciting with his description of blows then he was offered more pay by the minnesota north stars hockey team at ringside who can forget roger kent who's mispronouncing of words and sentences were historic like when a wrestler was big hes a big on punched or kicked in the guts right in the gussets or when kicked he punted him or the piledriver should be banned after nick bockwinkle used it on a helpless opponent right roger like you care after he left to greener money wwf they had rod trongard who's announcing style was great but different like when a wrestler scraped the sole of his boot across another guys forehead he'd say right across the front e lobe or when a wrestler is in trouble hes in a bad bad way he also would say awa the baddest toughest meanest most scientific wrestlers are here right in the awa no extra money verne gagne after he left wwf larry wheres phyllis nelson took over and i would talk to someone else or totally ignore him wwe wisely didn't take him also greg gagne had the ugliest wrestling boots i ever saw a yellow color of something i don't want to say also when hes looking for the tag he looks like he wants to get it over with so that he can run to the nearest restroom jumpin jim brunzell was such a great dropkick artist that you wonder why greg was ever his partner jerry blackwell rip was also a superstar wrestler but you wonder why verne had himself win against him puhleeeeze then when vince mcmahon would hire gagnes jobbers he would make most of them wrestle squash matches i like to see the gagne family say wrestlings real now
<START> i recently caught up with this little gem of a film on cable it took me by surprise even though i should have expected it from the team involved with this movie br br henry bromwell directed this film with a sure hand and it shows one always wonders about the secret life of hit killers one doesn't have to go too far to realize they probably are one's own neighbors or social acquaintances or even friends they're no different from us at least on the surface br br in this story the grandfather is a despicable character who does not hesitate in eliminating anyone for the right price he has no scruples in teaching the ropes to his own son and even to the grandson br br alex is a man living in turmoil he knows what he has done in the past and suddenly is coming to realize the consequence of his actions he has to see someone to help him find peace with himself in going to dr parks he is trying to find absolution although he doesn't find it there on the contrary there is a dramatic twist when alex learns about who is supposed to kill next br br alex brilliantly portrayed by william h macy mesmerizes us not only is he a fantastic actor but he makes us believe he is that man one of the best things in the movie is the late john ritter he is equally convincing as dr parks the man who unravels the mystery br br donald sutherland as the grandfather is perfect he is a natural actor in everything he does neve campbell surprised in her pivotal role of sarah she shows a capability and range that are incredible tracey ullman is martha the suffering wife and she doesn't get to do much also barbara bain in a rare appearance is the grandmother from hell david dorfman is a delight in the film he shows a maturity beyond his years br br
<START> there were only two things that kept me interested in this film i was waiting for owen wilson to die and catherine zeta jones br br this was basically a one woman show catherine zeta jones was just there to provide eye candy liam neeson was totally wasted in this film like jones he had no role at all the film was all lily taylor ransom ready to wear she was the only one that had any real part in this crappy script by david self ok it was his first one and he did redeem himself with road to perdition br br i don't know what director jan de bont's problem was he did a great job with speed and twister he really fell down on the job here maybe he was still recovering from the disaster speed 2 cruise control he should thank his lucky stars for the wild wild west else this would be the worst picture of 1999 br br avoid at all costs
<START> so i rented this from netflix because somebody gave me roger ebert's book i hated hated hated this movie and he gave this one a rare zero star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review mad dog time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor so i figured from ebert saying that i would see if it was really as bad as he said it was i know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but i could not express how much i hated this piece of junk like ebert did and never since ebert's review of rob reiner's north where he said he hated that movie ten times had i ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review here we have richard dreyfuss as a gangster which i don't think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well but above all the other things that were awful about this movie i can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all while the movie starts off with jeff goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching dreyfuss's girlfriend while dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits but after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot then there are a whole bunch of jokes about dreyfuss being mentally ill haha not funny then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying frank sinatra's my way sang by gabriel byrne apparently to insult dreyfuss of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader dreyfuss shoots byrne over five times and byrne just will not die are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny i can certainly tell you i did not care or find that funny not only am i disappointed in dreyfuss who i admire much as an actor for producing and starring in this tripe but i am also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum because this was released the same year that independence day was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history did goldblum feel that independence day would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if independence day were a bomb what did an oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this the opening sequence of mad dog time says that the movie is set on another planet i only wish now that i have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes out of my life that i will never get back ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough i am afraid every copy of mad dog time should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire i have yet to top a worst movie i have ever seen because this one has won it's honor as the worst movie ever
<START> like the arabian nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there's plot plot and more plot it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man's present where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come it must be admitted that the second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first like the arabian nights it tries to cram as many middle eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work a freed genie a beautiful princess a flying carpet fantastic mechanical toys sea voyages a crowded marketplace a wicked vizier jewels i don't know why it all works but it does everything is just so beautiful the sets are beautiful june duprez is beautiful rozsa's score is especially beautiful as usual it sounds hungarian but somehow he manages to convince us that he's being hungarian in a persian way
<START> i feel very sorry for people who go to movies with a pad and pencil to write down flaws and keep notes on how bad a movie is i feel equally contempt for people who go to movies and can't suspend reality and or let themselves enjoy 90 minutes aways from their boring or busy lives get a grip people ecgtb is a very entertaining movie if you take movies seriously this is not for you if you are expecting the movie to resemble the book in any way this is not for you but if you enjoyed the utter hilarity of priscilla queen of the desert or the what the hell am i watching of moulin rouge or the gross out comedy of the sweetest thing then let yourself escape to cowgirls it has some really funny parts hilarious actually it also has some really good music kudos to kd lang also did i mention it has 90 minutes of uma thurman need i say more
<START> i am a student of film and have been for several years and the concept of a cyber kung fu satirical chimpanzee had me wondering is this the film that's going to break the mold let's face it america has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar after such great classics as monkey trouble and dunston checks in i thought that the best ideas were already taken but then comes funky monkey i laughed i cried i contemplated suicide br br now i've read about demon possession in the bible but that still doesn't explain why someone would create such a product of evil first off having at least a shred of intelligence i realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape not a monkey at all however i was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film they didn't let me sum up this work of art a company by the name of z i t has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers why i think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas but when it would cost about an estimated 13 million dollars of government money to train one chimp this doesn't seem cost effective well anyways z i t brings in a cia specialist matthew modine to train clemens the chimp clemens is everything z i t hoped for he can take out an entire shift of guards who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall and yet still manage to remind us that we're watching a kid's movie as you may have guessed modine finds out that z i t 's intentions may be evil gasp and decides to break clemens out being a cia agent and all modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city rent a guest room regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime and using checks to pay for everything br br z i t finds out where modine is staying and sends two of their finest to retrieve him these guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since martin and lewis or was it turner and hooch it doesn't matter anyways because in the end for a heck of a twist ending the good guys win yay hooray for predictability throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself a lonely mom who needs a date and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by radio disney and you get funky monkey the climax to the movie a football game played by thugs bumblers a chimp and the nerd boy no one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football game br br funky monkey never lets up it's edge of your seat entertainment some might even call this the american beauty of monkey filled features after finishing this epic i recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe funky monkey is a metal rod among movies
