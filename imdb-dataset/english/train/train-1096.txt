<START> a young boy comes into a lot of money and promptly begins to live it up unfortunately the man whose money it really is happens to be very bad he wants his loot back when he discovers who has the bucks he begins trying to get it back he keeps getting foiled by this little kid who is just lucky enough to keep from falling into the evil man's hands sounds familiar i'll bet very predictable not interesting at all come up with something a bit different ok guys
<START> this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot is awful and the acting is worse the jokes that are attempted absolutley suck don't bother to waste your time on a dumb movie such as this and if for some reason that you do want to see this movie don't watch it with your parents
<START> this is no art house film it's mainstream entertainment br br lot's of beautiful people t a and action i found it very entertaining it's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating it's a fun film to watch jesse and chace are funny too which is just gravy definitely worth a rental br br so in summary i'd recommend checking it out for a little friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl if she likes to see other girls get it on br br the villains are good too vinnie corey large the hatian guy from heroes very nasty villains
<START> opening credits great music just right for this film cinematography sleazy to great effect br br harrowing excitement in a train wreck sort of way this is how out of control some lives can become wonderland depicts drug induced wildness and its consequences not as an aberration but shows how it really does happen in our society it is better than depictions of another wild group manson's because all manson films books etc concentrate so much on manson's insane mind rather than the overall picture of the cheap fame and randomness that is so pervasive nowadays br br if you want to see some of the best method acting on film watch kilmer in this movie he shows how the method can be riveting in the right role br br the filmmakers here succeed in raising out of control to the level of an art form not just for the sake of giving us cheap thrills
<START> those of the instant gratification era of horror films will no doubt complain about this film's pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count the fact is the empty acre is a good a example of how independent horror films should be done br br if you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back story could have come off the back of a count chocula box the empty acre is the movie for you br br set in the decaying remnants of the rural american dream the empty acre is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six month old baby as the couple's weak relationship falls apart a larger story plays out in the background at night a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path leaving no sign that it was ever there br br the film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writer director's faith in an intellectual audience br br there seems to be a sub text concerning the death of the american dream but i would hardly call the film an allegory riveting well acted and technically astute the empty acre is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love
<START> the psychology of this movie is really weird to try and figure out its often billed as an anti rpg movie but its really not that simple here are come apparent contradictions that make me wonder just what if anything they're trying to say about gaming br br they laboriously introduce all the characters home lives by way of introduction all of them having parents who are divorced alcoholic and totally out of touch with their lives except for the times they're harshly pressuring them to succeed tom hanks is arguably the worst off having just failed out of another school and still dealing with a brother who disappeared and may be dead br br its mentioned a couple of times that they play the game to work through problems in their real lives and sure enough at the end when they go to see robbie hanks they're all happy and well adjusted embarking on their adult careers problems solved games put away daniel doesn't even want to design computer games any more and even robbie's mother who's been constantly drunk and dissatisfied is suddenly the happy homemaker looking fresh and bright and arranging flowers br br sure jj suddenly and quite cheerfully it seems decides to commit suicide but the reason seems to be entirely because he's a lonely boy genius who can't get a date and not because his character dies as in the famous jack chick tract which happens afterward anyways and it almost seems like he does it on purpose so he can end daniels game and get everyone to come play his in fact the prospect of live action role playing in the caverns seems to be the only thing that saves him from killing himself and in what may be the coolest tableau scene in the whole movie kate looking very fetching in chain mail looks right at the camera and says something like the scariest monsters are the ones in our own minds br br the biggest fantasy element in this movie is the two muggers passing up the rich couple so they can rob the dirty homeless looking guy of his magic beans the recurring theme a the way we were for the 80s might have been poignant at the end but as a way to kick off a movie is downright depressing and seems out of place and for one final mystery our hero wearing full pardu regalia has a psychotic break becomes his character completely and embarks on his quest so of course the first thing he does is change into 20 century street clothes br br so maybe the movie's irrational but i guess its dealing with an irrational topic in those days a circle of kids with dice and pencils was regarded as tainted and possibly possessed and you could go insane if they spoke their mumbo jumbo at you the anti game paranoia is pretty much summed up in the first scene where the reporter asks the cop whats going on the cop says a kids lost in the tunnels and there's a chance mazes and monsters is somehow involved the reporter admits to being vaguely familiar with the game although he allows his own children to play it then turns to the camera and reels off a polished spiel that blames the game for everything and admits no possibility of another explanation in the end its no masterpiece but interesting as made for tv movies go
<START> rosie wasted a lot of tv time talking about the tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of the modern day puerto rican they were not the truth is that the africans and the spanish were and she knows it what kills me is that she is standing on the screen looking like some average light skin black chick with an obvious black daddy cousins and auntie pretending to truly acknowledge the real essence of what makes them the modern day puerto ricans but barely mentioned how africans influenced the way their spanish is spoken the food and music she is so typical and i lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does also since she wants to dance around her african ness then she need not take more roles associated with blackness i e lackawanna blues we can find a prideful black latina next time thank you zoe saldana gina torres gina ravera and melissa desousa br br to the puerto rican on here that said they are african and not black thank you we blacks certainly do not have anything in common with you so there is no love lost but since you are probably in the states and have benefited from the civil rights movement we would like for you refuse any decent human treatment you received courtesy of the blood sweat and tears from the backs of the blacks you share nothing with br br if i am correct puerto ricans have a terrible image in the media but we blacks do not spend our time trying to disrespect you because we know that the media loves to exploits the low points and behaviors of all minorities to maintain mindless generalizations however you evidently have fed into the hype that one you are somehow white or superior you are not also you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is bet again you are incorrect and need to take a vacation out of the hood try visiting atlanta ga houston texas charlotte n c trust me none of those blacks want to claim your culture either
<START> abu the thief of bagdad helps king ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer br br as europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames sir alexander korda's london films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of the arabian nights replete with swords sorcery it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines it also is a fine piece of film making featuring good acting and an intelligent script br br conrad veidt gets top billing and he deserves it playing the evil magician jaffar his saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during silent days here is a villain worth watching as the boyish thief sabu is perfectly cast in this his third film while not a hero in the typical sense of the word his character is certainly heroic in deed action br br the rest of the cast do fine work john justin is both energetic sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way sabu gets a significant part of the action when he's not transformed into a dog but justin is appropriately athletic when needs must lovely june duprez plays the endangered princess of basra coveted by two very different men appearing late in the film massive rex ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude br br allan jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the storyteller miles malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike sultan of basra forever dithering on about his mechanical toys malleson was also responsible for the film's screen play dialogue aged morton selten portrays the benevolent king of legend mary morris later an exceptional stage actress plays the dual roles of jaffar's accomplice and the six armed silver dancer br br the film was begun in britain but wartime difficulties made korda move it to southern california which probably explains the presence of american ingram in the cast the art direction in vibrant technicolor is most attractive especially the fairy tale architecture in blues whites pinks br br br br born sabu dastagir in 1924 sabu was employed in the maharaja of mysore's stables when he was discovered by korda's company and set before the cameras his first four films elephant boy 1937 the drum 1938 the thief of bagdad 1940 jungle book 1942 were his best and he found himself working out of hollywood when they were completed after distinguished military service in world war ii he resumed his film career but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films black narcissus 1947 being the one great exception his final movie walt disney's a tiger walks 1964 was an improvement but it was too late sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963 only 39 years of age
<START> if i write a review about a movie maybe it will stick with me but generally i expect that i will have forgotten i've seen this one a mere two weeks from now so why bother because again i find myself watching a low rated movie that was fun to watch i didn't expect i'd to be able to stay in the room while it was on br br it wasn't great but at least it was not unbearable not a comedy of errors which always makes me cringe it was just sweet fluff and if you can't take it stay in the locker room boys i agree with those who defend this movie because it is sure to please its targeted demographic and won't be a total bore to an adult br br it offers a few good chuckles here and there but nary a side splitter sure it is silly and only mildly entertaining but at least it doesn't suck as so many have said it does maybe those folks are afraid of their sensitive sides br br i have a tendency to grade on the bell curve so a 4 5 or 6 is actually an okay all around rating in my book giving it a 4 makes sense and will bolster its rating at the time of this writing giving it a 1 or a 10 as most have done thus far makes the rating numbers meaningless i cannot believe how strongly people feel one way or the other about this forgettable fluff or that i am even bothering to write about it am i missing something br br anyway it should be noted that emma roberts performs her role as clairedycat quite convincingly ariell kebbel often written into b ch roles does not disappoint when her character gets her due you might also recognize bruce spence playing leonard though his role is ancillary br br surely you can miss this one if you are an adult but if there is a pre teen girl in your life rent this movie for her and be prepared not to hate it you might even enjoy it
<START> when i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies i watched then with very low expectations now this movie isn't bad per se you get what you pay for it is a tale of love betrayal lies sex scandal everything you want in a movie definitely not a hollywood blockbuster but for cheap thrills it is not that bad i would probably never watch this movie again in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time despite the bad acting clichÃ© lines and sub par camera work i didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player the story has been done many times in many movies this one is no different no better no worse br br just your average movie
<START> prom night is about a girl named donna brittany snow who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night and by doing so killing her family friends and her enemies br br now before i begin let me say have you been tired of pg 13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'oh my god' and talking about girlish things and are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying and the last thing are you tired of the us remaking asian japanese and chinese films that pretty much sums up prom night but i'm still not done with the review br br the only reason to see 'prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills if not don't see prom night you never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall and by the way the deaths are repeating like 24 7 so not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious by the time i met the cast i think i was ready to hurl too much girl talk too much guy talk and lots of 'oh my gosh it's our prom' i understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate br br if i were to put prom night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films i'd be the first one too i'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on dvd for cheap and quick seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting cheap scares and a 'night to die for' when watching the film br br 1 star out of 10 p s if i could give the film zero stars i would
<START> i have never observed four hours pass quite so quickly as when i saw this film this film restores the power and art to hamlet that it was always meant to have even those oh so famous speeches are done in new and inventive ways and the cast is incredible brannagh the brightest star it is his charisma power and command of the role that defines the movie making it a full and complete version fills so many holes and allows for new appreciation of the tragedy despite the length where one would expect the dark gloomy cliched castle we are treated to a sumptuous feast for the eyes the only gloom comes from hamlet himself as it should well worth your time all four hours of it
<START> this is a great movie to see with your girlfriend my friend and i both love dance and ran into this movie at the video store we had to get it with no violence and such a warming story its a great movie to relax to and just enjoy your night i would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie
<START> the second alternate gundam universe tale g gundam being the first gundam wing is yet another different view into the gundam verse the familiar elements are found but gundam wing is actually different then its counterparts the biggest being the gundams are nothing more than terrorists combating one lone organization in truth the series doesn't really become a show about war until episode 7 but in truth the real conflict the eve wars don't happen until the later episodes br br the greatest positives of this series are it's characters all the main characters are fleshed out throughout the 49 episode run and you can really sympathize with each of the roles their put in another great plus is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series the designs put some of it's other gundam counterparts to shame br br one of the biggest criticism of this series is how many die hard uc fans claim rip off of the original uc saga why gundam wing gets this rap when the more apparent uc clone of gundam seed is out there is beyond me true there are many moments lifted but their told in new ways and there are distinct differences as well br br take for example the usual comparison of zechs merquise and uc icon char aznable throughout the series zechs is more the outcast in the alliance and in ways oz as well while the red comet was shining symbol of zeon another big difference is the fact zechs loses a lot soldiers under his command hence the other nickname he's given in the early episodes killer of his own men char isn't given this label br br the problems with this series isn't the philosophy mumbo jumbo but two problems the first is the reused animation footage of the gundams attacks sure it's fun seeing heavy arms attack tanks ms and planes the first time but on it's fourth re use scenes like this do get old br br the second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year if you really think about all the events springing in the series a lot happens in just one lone year br br but i guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the intro's first lines every so often as it ranks this is probably the best of the alternate universe gundam tales and a great introduction into the gundam world after all this was the very first gundam anime to air in the us television
<START> this film was a yawn from titles to credits it's boring to the point of tedium and the acting is wooden and stilted admittedly this was director richard jobson directing debut but who on earth green lit a script as poorly developed as this one looks like another money down the drain government project scottish screen are credited surprise surprise i nearly fell asleep three times and my review will unfortunately have to be more restrained than this one please please mister jobson what ever you've been doing prior to directing this sedative of a film go back to it
<START> i have passed several times on watching this since i figured it was some dumb sappy dated romantic comedy well it is a romantic comedy and maybe a little dated however it is not overly sentimental touching as it does on themes of office politics adultery and loneliness you think you know exactly where things are headed but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest and not everything turns out quite as you had expected but there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic if you meet someone who doesn't like this movie seriously consider how well you want to know them
<START> up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga which finally ended in 2005 i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long running series the varied action scenes and really different characters jabba the hut furry woodland creatures etc made this a particularly appealing movie br br none of the action ever focused too long in one spot either the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser duel between luke skywalker and darth vader br br another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in fighting between two of the stars gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford finally everyone was on the same page it was nice to see br br in the end this was simply a wonderful adventure tale more than anything else
<START> this is a must see for independant movie fans but it also holds up well against mainstream movies i think we have the makings of the next woody allen or br br trentin tarrentino here br br the budget is painfully low no special effects whatsoever and they seemingly used ambient lighting shot in digital video and yet this movie grabs hold of you and never lets go the screenplay is somewhat bizarre yet the actors and director pull it off with complete realism it has humor it has intrigue and it has pathos and it all works together br br no point in describing the details if you want to see an independant br br masterpiece a virtual lesson in how to make a low budget flick that really works see this one br br oh yeah it's also really entertaining br br
<START> if you love kung fu films and you haven't seen this movie you are cheating yourself this movie is one of the only kung fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film normally it takes a die hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films but this one has it all the story is well told and complete the fight scenes are great and tend to end before you're completely bored with them unlike crouching tiger throw in a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself one heck of a movie see this one at all costs heck my wife even enjoyed it br br wu du it br br 9 out of 10 br br
<START> the movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of baghdad the jailed prince meets a thief called abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with but unbeknown to him the evil wizard jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns abu into a dog this leads to the prince and abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat jafa restore peace to baghdad and marry the princess during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic genies that takes abu on a flight through the clouds a giant spider that's really hungry and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen br br this is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses genies flying carpets and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs it doesn't have any cheesy moments and the love story isn't a waste of time the production designs are just stunning in this movie from the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter even though this movie is over 40 years old the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today's cinema the music and songs are also well done anyone who sees it will no doubt hail i want to be a sailor sailing on the seas as one of the great musical moments in movies i'm usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since i find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but i'll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie br br what sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don't see in everyday life which is also the same reason why i love stuff like two towers and silent hill way before today's modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic cgi to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place one of my favorite shots in two towers is the one where we see the trolls opening the black gates the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor and that's what i love about the genie and other creatures in the movie they're just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they're all just fantasy beings br br it's literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of aladdin got their inspiration the characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative genie right down to the flying carpet it's not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it's nice to know that i'm not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie i first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week i still think it's amazing that's a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time sure the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40's so give it a break not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today's standard br br if you ever wanted to see a live action version of aladdin then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won't be their cup of tea
