<START> actually the movie is neither horror nor sci fi with a very strong christian religious theme this movie delivers minimal content and no suspense second tier actors do half decent jobs of reading their boring roles the only good performance is by sydney penny who plays a role of a mother of i won't spoil the movie it's either christ or anti christ avoid watching this movie unless you a christian religious fanatic obsessed with apocalypse br br being a non christian i had to force myself to watch this movie just because i wanted to write this review it's a pity that sci fi channel had to air this movie at the peak evening time
<START> i had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations basically because of kamal hassan he is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever but this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen after watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better br br the protagonist raghavan is a very daring police officer who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree finally raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives br br these two psycho killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters the murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly which the movie could have survived without br br to even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty the director gautham should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience certainly i am never going to the movies looking like gautham's name on the production list
<START> the screenwriter poorly attempted to re create the exorcist' but put in some blah blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged there is no substance whatsoever in this entire film it had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people yack about things nobody cares about extremely boring i wanted to leave the theater when i saw this but the dumb movie tickets were expensive so i had to withstand the dreary torture which felt like it lasted forever nothing on screen connected relevance back to whatever the characters were talking about br br they use computer graphics in here that instead of wowing me as it intended i hate cgi just ruined the movie even more some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how thought provoking and slow paced without action because it's an intelligent film it was what is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy heath ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion seems like an uninspired concept oh and there's some mumbo jumbo about the sin eater movie was originally going to be titled sin eater lame concept but the movie took the sin eater thing too seriously making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was yeah i know there were really sin eaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesy br br nothing in the movie was executed right and i forget why i even bothered to see this movie if you want horror films that actually have depth watch rosemary's baby the tenant naked blood society cannibal holocaust pin exorcist omen or any of the romero dead trilogy films nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence people mainstream movie fans think that though same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like hulk is a cinematic masterpiece if you want mind numbingly boring horror watch the order this movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride
<START> when the matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration that didn't really happen surprisingly and it took till 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear but to say cypher is a clone would be to its discredit br br the story is of a morgan sullivan who applies for a job with a high flying techno company called digicorp his job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company while under an assumed and false identity his home life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he's actually doing however things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what's going on he starts to question who he actually is this is not helped by a strange woman who turns up br br twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable br br it's an enthralling journey through a not too distant future and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat br br highly recommended
<START> i watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else on it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painful i urge anyone to watch this just to see how turgidly awful a movie can be surely it was deliberate i cringed at every futile attempt at humour carried out in such a childish unrehearsed badly executed way that it was beyond belief this is the movie that makes spiceworld look like goodfellas think i am exaggerating well give it airtime and think again dreadful utterly dreadful if this wasn't a prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and promptly shot after being forced to watch this film again
<START> i sat down to watch midnight cowboy thinking it would be another overrated '60s '70s movie some of my favorite films come from the '70s in the same vein as midnight cowboy taxi driver mean streets panic in needle park etc but there are many many overrated ones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking unfortunately a vast majority of them don't hold up as well today i sort of feel this way about easy rider although it too is one of my favorites br br so i didn't expect much from midnight cowboy but got a lot back it's a touching story well made and well told with some of the best performances of all time dustin hoffman as enrico ratso rizzo gives one of his best it's a bit funny at times he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks maybe because of the lenny simpsons connection but hoffman is entirely convincing half of the film's budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in hollywood opposite him is the second billed jon voight as joe buck the cowboy who travels north to the big apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named ratso who offers to become joe's manager for a certain percentage of profits br br the movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long some films can tend to drag especially some of the films that were made in the '70s because as it's been said in easy riders raging bulls the directors were the stars of the movies in the 1970s and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material going on too long examining characters scenes etc that aren't important just about the only scene i felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party it makes the film seem extremely outdated similar to the drug odysseys in easy rider and really harms its flow because it's not needed br br other than that midnight cowboy is an almost flawless motion picture i was pleasantly surprised it does have its flaws flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been for instance and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy such as the gay movie theater sequence but if you can handle its content midnight cowboy is a truly great motion picture an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late '60s early '70s it's a depressing movie yes and by today's standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of life is horrible etc but i still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long long time br br highly recommended one of the best films of the '70s it was technically released in late 1969 but i'd still categorize it as a 1970s film it also won the best picture oscar being the first and only x rated motion picture to do so it was later re rated r on appeal br br 4 5 5
<START> i read the book celestine prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book many of the book's most interesting points do not even come out in the movie it is a b movie at best many events characters how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur the flow of events that in the book are very smooth are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child the character development is very poor personnallities of the characters differ from those in the book the direction is similar to a b horror flick i understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book but they screen play base missed many points the casting was very good
<START> this is hands down the greatest stand up show ever i've seen a lot of stand up shows been to a lot of stand up shows and watch bet's comic view but i have never seen anyone who could match the skills of murphy on this show the impressions are excellent the skits are great and the timing is perfect you can even tell the crowd gets really into when he did raw a few years later it was also really good but this is 1 in my book also shows that at one time particularly the early to mid eighties that murphy was funny my favorite parts of the show is when he is retelling the family barbecue and ice cream mooommmm the ice cream man is coming another great part is where his mom is like clint eastwood
<START> a wonderful television mini series completely ruined by a 45 year old woman trying desperately to pass herself off as a 16 year old ingenue no exaggeration that's the actual age of the character played by ali macgraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at pearl harbor this tv mini series really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one i refer to whenever the topic comes up br br that alone makes this completely unwatchable despite the fact it's one of the best filmed wwii 'global' dramas tv has ever produced if you have the stomach or a decent fast forward ability you might be able to enjoy the late robert mitchum in a very strong performance br br i'm stunned at some of the comments referring to the love story pun intended did they watch the film with their eyes closed or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their selective memories and selective vision i'm a boomer myself so don't think for a second i'm some hubristic young punk 45 will always look 45 get used to it deal with it age gracefully damnit br br the winds of war could have been so good how much more would we be talking about this mini series today some 25 years later had an actual ingenue been cast in such an important critical role right now with the constant haggard old biddy distraction that alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of the winds of war
<START> the deadly look of love is essentially fatal attraction with a couple of twists added onto the back half the ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three movies of the week it is yet another cautionary tale about succumbing to temptation and it adds nothing fresh to the genre br br brett vincent spano is engaged to a beautiful woman who just happens to have a sizable trust fund even though he has it all he risks losing everything by starting up a steamy side affair with janet jordan ladd janet a doe eyed blonde from cedar falls falls hard for brett and she does not take it particularly well when he comes clean about his engagement shortly after the wedding mrs brett turns up dead in the master bedroom of the large luxurious home she shared with her new husband when the police question brett he promptly points the finger at janet following her arrest janet seems to get loonier by the minute not that she was the picture of stability before her defense attorney holland taylor is convinced that janet is innocent and is hell bent on proving it br br did she do it or didn't she how will it end you can find out the answers to these questions the next time the deadly look of love airs on your local station and be sure not to miss the moral of this beautiful story men are pigs and women are crazy
<START> the whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts no problem this film features a line up of some of the most diversely creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast the segments are devised around the same theme love in paris but the resemblance ends there actually considering that the approach to the theme from all these different directors takes so many forms it is amazing that we can even feel we are still watching the same film no great effort has been made to turn it into a comprehensive whole this buffet has so many great ingredients i am glad nobody tried to put them all in a single dish
<START> one of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt german expressionism the highly atmospheric style of film making developed during the 20s in berlin classic movies like das cabinet des dr caligari 1920 and nosferatu eine symphonie des grauens 1922 were the most famous direct results of this movement and while the movement didn't have a long life its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today specially in the horror genre one of the key figures of this style would be director paul wegener director of 1920's der golem wie er in die welt kam as in his debut as a filmmaker seven years before the making of that classic he was already making experiments with expressionism in film that early prototype of german expressionism was incidentally another horror film der student von prag br br der student von prag the student of prague is the story of balduin paul wegener a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in prague but who always find himself with financial troubles one day balduin rescues the beautiful countess margit grete berger from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again but soon he discovers that he'll have to compete with her rich cousin graf von schwarzenberg lothar kÃ¶rner who also wants to marry her knowing that he can't offer her much balduin wishes to be wealthy and this is where a sorcerer named scapinelli john gottowt enters the scene scapinelli offers balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room balduin accepts the proposal only to discover in horror that what scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror br br loosely inspired by edgar allan poe's short story william wilson and the classic legend of faust the story of der student von prag was conceived by german writer hanns heinz ewers a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature written at a time where cinema in germany was still being developed as an art form der student von prag shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes like most of the scriptwriters of his time ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater although der student von prag begins to move away from that style while a bit poor on its character development specially on the supporting characters ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of balduin br br while der student von prag was paul wegener's directorial debut and stellan rye's second film as a filmmaker it's very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly giving great use to guido seeber's cinematography the two young filmmakers create a powerful gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the german filmmakers of the following decade would do wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his golem series from seeber and rye despite having very limited resources rye and wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing for its time visual effect for the scenes with balduin's reflection played by wegener too already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers br br as balduin paul wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie it certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer but one can't deny that wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract john gottowt plays the sinister scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove few is said about scapinelli in the film but gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared the rest of the main cast is less lucky with grete berger being pretty much average as countess margit and lothar kÃ¶rner making a poor graf von schwarzenberg however it must be said that lyda salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and fritz weidemann made an excellent baron waldis schwarzenberg showing the dignity that lÃ¶rner's character should have had br br considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake made 13 years after this film is superior in every possible way it's not difficult to understand why der student von prag hasn't stood the test of time as well as other early films the movie's main problem is definitely its extremely low budget as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what ewers' story needed to be fully developed this makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times or even incomplete as if there was something missing in the narrative of course there's also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete however der student von prag is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time left a powerful impression in history br br as the direct predecessor of the german expressionist movement it's hard to deny the enormous importance that der student von prag has in the history of german cinema probably in the history of cinema in general it may look dated even for its time but considering the limited resources its director had it's truly better than most films from that era as the movie that started paul wegener's career and with that german expressionism der student von prag is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history 7 10
<START> this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone and learn about the people who lived there br br i enjoyed the story characters acting and scenes a few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly otherwise a wonderful piece br br the main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it the scenes with her and alex descas nadir are charming and lovely br br i recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating
<START> i was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies in their long list of films was this film and i thought i must be hallucinating at such an offensive title and premise but no that's really what it was and since the film was only about 27 minutes long i decided to give it a try if it had turned out to be some porno movie i would have stopped watching instead it turned out to be the most bizarre film i have ever seen the danish production crew tried with a budget of about 49 to make a star trek style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women like they proceeded to do on the earth and in every case they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet br br subtle this ain't with some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters i've ever heard i don't even think i can write them on imdb without having my review removed however despite the utter crappiness of it all it was strangely watchable and worth a peek but as i mentioned already due to the crude names and odd subject matter though no nudity it's a film for adults only br br by the way this movie left me with 1001 questions as to who would make this why make it and who was the intended audience it may not be the absolute worst thing i have ever seen but it probably is the weirdest and possibly the most offensive
<START> the danish movie slim slam slum surprised me to be the worst movie i have seen to this date i didn't think that it was possible to top my list of bad bad b movies but this one deserves the gold it's not funny it's bad acting it's bad filmed and the storyline is bad the only positive thing i can say about this movie is it has three girls in it i truly believe this flick has the potential to knock of the other danish movie stjerner uden hjerner as the badest danish film ever made and that's truly something congratulations in advance
<START> this movie got off to an interesting start down the road however the story gets convoluted with a poor illustration of ancient black magic rituals the male lead was very good even though he gets the worst end of the stick in the climax in comparison this is boomerang meets extremities
<START> winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after wwii director anthony mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction jimmy stewart does an excellent job but i think stephen mcnalley and john mcintire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the treasured winchester 73 going to the winner this is a good script with several stories going on at the same time look for the first appearance of rock hudson as young bull thank god with in a few years we would begin to let indians play themselves in western films the film is in black and white and was shot in tucson arizona i would not put winchester 73 in the category of stagecoach high noon or shane but it gets an above average recommendation from me br br
<START> this film moves the cinderella story forward to the early 1950s and makes good if eccentric use of the isle of man as a background the ugly sisters have become wildly glamorous upper class english girls and together with kathleen turner as the stepmother they flounce about in various wonderful period costumes the story is altered a little from the traditional version early on it is oddly combined with the plot of king lear and in later stages cinderella is rather more assertive than is usual it looks splendid and works on the whole pretty well but does go over the top at times
<START> the makers of this film have created a future where not only is abortion and birth control illegal in every state but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serve long prison sentences in other words this film is every liberals worst nightmare the political agenda is so heavy handed here and the style of the film is so low key that it just loses steam pretty quickly regardless of which side of the fence you're on i'd recommend skipping it
<START> about two hundred members of a cleveland ohio usa film society named cinematheque gathered on august 19 2000 to view a pristine cinemascope print of michelangelo antonioni's 1970 film zabriskie point cinematheque director john ewing who does a superlative job of obtaining the finest prints for his series shared with the audience beforehand that this print was specially flown over from italy for this one showing only br br the audience was held spellbound as the film unfolded its artisty on the huge panoramic screen watching this superb print shown the way antonioni intended made one aware that this is indeed a modern art work it was all the more fitting that the series is housed in the cleveland insititue of art in university circle br br antonioni's compositions are created for the cinemascope landscape his beautiful balancing of images striking use of colors sweeping choreographic movements all are the work of a genuine artist using the screen as his canvas br br at last the audience could understand zabriskie point as its narrative unfolded it became obvious that this work is not about story per se but rather an artist's impressionistic rendering of fleeting images of his subject the setting of some of the more turbulent activities of the sixties provides only a dramatic motor for the artist's sweeping collage br br antonioni is not bound by conventional narrative standards and can pause at any point to creatively embroider an event with grandiose embellishments the audience willingly went with the flow of his remarkable imagination as his huge images on the massive canvas held one in rapt attention while the audience may have been only tangentially involved in character relationships it realized the theme here is human aleination the director's recurring theme br br it was also realized that no print any smaller or of lesser quality than this original one in cinemascope can do justice to this particular rendering the audience was therefore all the more appreciative of viewing zabriskie point in its original breathtaking format and broke into thunderous applause at the end
