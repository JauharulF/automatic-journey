<START> basically this is a pale shadow of high fidelity which was a witty and wonderfully acted film with several truly winning character turns watching the detectives has none of that br br the premise of a video store geek swept off his feet by a quirky mystery woman is a good one but is never fully or adequately explored thanks to a very weak script and the miscasting of the leads not to mention the lack of any real visual story telling style i mean this film is centered around movies yet is itself incredibly uncinematic that's a major failing right there br br but the main problem is we simply don't care about the main characters because the script and the actors murphy and liu fail to make them true or sympathetic in any real way so the film just becomes a series of episodes involving two people who seem well not terribly interesting br br oh yeah another thing for a romantic comedy it's not funny and the romance isn't terribly romantic either br br so avoid it even at its 90 something minute running time it's just not worth sitting through
<START> of all the versions of the odyssey or of any greek mythological story for that matter this in my opinion is the best of them all almost true to the original storyline with some minor deviations and omissions e g the absence of scylla charybdis and the fact that eumaeus the swineherd recognizes odysseus in disguise in his hut realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece not some hollywoodish sword and sandal b flick notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in italian if one is familiar with the storyline he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying provided you have a good handy text of the odyssey at hand at least i did and so much so that it has inspired me to study the italian language to better appreciate the movie even more
<START> i was interested in the topic and only fans of drew barrymore's dancing on david letterman's desk will find anything remotely interesting in it ok she shows some breast or maybe a body double does the plot is slashed to bits and the acting is horrible neither lead has any material to work with as the direction of the film leads nowhere don't waste your time see donnie darko instead if you want a creepy drew barrymore film and if you want to see another skip this and see darko again br br the treatment of the doppelganger legend is absolutely criminal as well refer to charles williams' novel descent into hell for something worth considering instead this is just an excuse to make a b film to go straight to video and suck some life out of people at blockbuster br br what makes any of these people think the acting here was praiseworthy give me a break
<START> there have been some low moments in my life when i have been bewildered and depressed sitting through rancid aluminium was one of these br br the warning signs were there no premiere even the stars didn't want to attend and no reviews in magazines the only reason i sat through the film was in the hope that i might catch up on some sleep br br nothing in the film was explained the narration was idiotic i cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot then to my growing despair it was revealed that he hadn't really been shot dampening my joy i sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity br br there were some positive aspects mainly unintentional moments of humour for example the scene in which the main character for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his ears br br my words cannot explain the anger i feel so i shall conclude thus br br rancid aluminium for sadists wastrels and regressives only who want to torture themselves
<START> love the tv show was hooked first time i saw it wish i was there acting in with them it touches reality when you love someone and you are thinking that you want to spend the rest of your life with then at a turn of events that you meet someone else and that person is more of who you want to be with you are in a situation were you have to choose one or the other someone is going to get hurt there's no stopping that making the decision is hard but do you want to go on being unhappy when you could have been why go on and live a life that you thought that you wanted or thinking you are doing the right thing and you both be unhappy that other person isn't going to wait a life time waiting they have a life a well making the decision that you really want will be better in the end making the best of what you have is a good thing a well money cars houses etc don't make you happy having the one person that you really want to be with to share it with does
<START> i think that movie can t be a scott s film that is impossible do you remember blade runner and alien two greats movies versus a one i hope didnÂ´t see ever it good bye
<START> otto preminger completing a noir cycle at twentieth century fox reunited his laura leads for this stark gritty detective drama dana andrews again portrays a cop but this time he's hardened cynical and has been accused of police brutality by his superior you don't hate hoods you liked to beat them up mark dixon andrews despises criminals as his own father was a crook he doesn't want to be sandy dixon's kid so he became a policeman but his methods are harsh and hated br br one night investigating a murder he unknowingly punches a suspect ken paine craig stevens so hard that it kills him a shaken dixon does his best to cover it up intending to frame a hated thug scalise gary merrill for the crime however the blame falls on paine's father in law jiggs taylor tom tully whose daughter department store model morgan taylor tierney is estranged from her husband but keeps getting drawn into his gambling schemes paine had slapped his wife enraging her father who did show up at his son in law's apartment but not until dixon had departed with the body with no better suspects jiggs is arrested and charged br br riddled with guilt mark falls for morgan and offers money for an attorney he decides to take on scalise anyway but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death confessing everything in the end he cannot live with the knowledge with what he has done and he permits the letter to be read by his superior and by morgan despite all the tragic circumstances morgan professes her love for mark and will wait for him br br it was great to find this film on dvd after so many years of televised obscurity eddie mueller a film noir historian provides the commentary and does a good job but i find his assertion that audiences wouldn't have caught the significance of the casting of the two leads since laura had been made six years earlier in that respect he is mistaken because they had appeared in the iron curtain two years prior to wtse and the film was a box office success br br andrews and tierney were fabulous together and ruth donnelly is tremendous comic relief as restaurant owner martha fanning the flames between the detective and the dame br br the night cityscapes give the film an air of menace gary merrill is great as the low life scalise who had a criminal past with dixon's dad your father liked me he taunts mark karl malden and a young neville brand are terrific also and tom tully is just touching and funny as morgan's unjustly accused pop br br a watchable film noir with a fantastic cast
<START> when i sat down to watch 'largo winch' i expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars when i stood up i've seen both of these and more br br karl roden was finally not the antagonist in a movie to start with kristin scott thomas played her role well but the real two stars in my opinion were tomer sisley and miki manojlovic both acting superbly in radivoje bukvic portrayed goran well br br the mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the movie but i understand why people would get bored with it br br the scenery of hong kong and especially the stunning croatian seaside both amazed me and i hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when largo entered the unbelievably beautiful island br br rolls royce phantom mercedes s500 and bmw 7 if anyone loves expensive limousine type cars this is their movie it is also a movie for people who love action sequences good acting landscapes of extremal beauty and above all a fast paced well written action movie with dazzling combat and a thoroughly twined inner drama br br my vote as it has enlightened a gloomy day is 10 10
<START> i am curious yellow a film in near seussical rhyme is said right at the start to be available in two versions yellow and blue was one of those big art house hits that first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandal cause celebre in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court what's potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of what's revealed in the sex or nudity the director actor vilgot sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but it's always more so an intellectual expression than very lust like but the daring of the attempt at a pure 'metafilm' while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in sweden who knew such things in a generally peaceful country i e usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars could be so heated up politically at least that's part of sjoman's aim here br br like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like w r if not as surreal and deranged or to a slightly lesser extent bertolucci sjoman is out to mix politics and sex mostly politics and social strata around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film the two characters lena and borje have a hot cold relationship in the story of the film where lena is a curious socialist wannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and 'trains' sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend and as this is going on which is by itself enough for one movie sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film there's even a great bit midway through where as if at a rock concert title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are negating having to use end credits then with this there's a whole other dynamic as sjoman gives an actual performance not just a hey i'm the director playing the director bit br br at first one might not get this structure and that i am curious yellow is just a film where lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class socialism spain and franco and once in a while we see lena's father or bjore but sjoman does something interesting the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes it's impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative documentary film within a film and even a serious interview with martin luther king who also acts as a quasi guru for lena it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically but it doesn't feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture the satire sjoman is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other wavelength his anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewer br br if i am curious yellow stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a full blown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors it isn't entirely successful i think as an emotional experience where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors occasionally it works if only for the actors lena nyman mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even and borje ahlstedt a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile lena but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the inner film of lena and borje since perhaps intentionally sjoman fills it up with clichÃ©s borje has a girlfriend and kid will he leave her how will lena reconcile her father and a heavy handed narration from his starlet of sorts br br and yet for whatever faults sjoman may have ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself i am curious yellow holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema or testing what couldn't be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage i'd even go as far as to say it's influential and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time a specific technique used with the film rewinding towards the end is echoed in poorer usage in funny games and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avant garde or meta film making if it's not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as w r or last tango it's close behind
<START> hopalong cassidy with a horse who is not white not named topper go figure br br this travesty does a gross injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes hopalong cassidy the actor who plays him is young versus old blond haired versus white haired and kills people versus shooting the gun out of their hands will the real hopalong please stand up br br one of the worst movies ever made believe it or not by the person who brought us the grandfather saga
<START> tigerland is one of the finest films that i have seen and in my opinion it outdoes even full metal jacket a film of similar nature bozz is played exceptionally well by farrell and is a character who stays in your mind long after the film ends the ending is brilliantly cut by schumacher with the melodic harmony singing and the slow mo of the troops preparing to leave what a film
<START> a vietnam vet decides to take over a backwater town run amok and anyone who steps in his path is eliminated including women released to theaters just prior to a star is born which turned his career around this action drama mishmash starring kris kristofferson is wildly off kilter thoughtless and mean spirited filmed in simi valley ca the results are truly unseemly with redneck clichÃ©s and mindless violence making up most of director george armitage's script armitage has gathered a most curious '70s cast for his film including jan michael vincent victoria principal bernadette peters and in a bit loni anderson however the center of the whole thing is kristofferson who is gruff and rude throughout it deserves points i suppose for being a completely unsympathetic drive in thriller but the bad vibes and the ridiculous climax coat the whole project like an ugly stain 1 2 from
<START> first off i have to say that i loved the book animal farm i read it with my 9th grade class and it was great we also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial the movie was so disappointing to me the movie cuts out some characters and misses a lot of the main points of the book it skips around a lot and doesn't explain anything in detail if someone was watching this movie without having first read the book they would be confused the most disappointing thing in this movie to me was the ending the ending in the book was the most powerful and in the movie they changed it it was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of melting together but instead the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs to sum up i don't think that this movie captured the real meaning that orwell portrayed in his book
<START> years ago many big studios promoted serial films that were shown in movie theaters's in between the actual features along with a newsreel of current events plus cartoons especially on a saturday afternoon the parents loved it mostly the return of chandu was a 12 episode serial where chandu bela lugosi the mysterious mr wong '34 is a magician with super natural powers and travels to the island of lemuria to rescue the kidnapped princess of egypt nadji maria alba dr terror's house of horrors '43 princess nadji is held captive by the black magic cult of ubasti who believe that she is a reincarnation of their long dead goddess ossana these 12 episode serials take you way back in time and are very well produced considering we are talking about 1934
<START> i am a big fan of fred macmurray and carole lombard and in addition to them charles butterworth a very enjoyable supporting actor was in this film so why didn't i particularly enjoy it well despite a good cast this is one of the poorest written and most clichÃ©d a pictures i have ever seen given the talent and money spent to make this film it is shocking how slip shod the writing was i knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film i found myself predicting exactly what would happen next and i was always right and this isn't because i am some sort of movie savant but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it in fact it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichÃ©s all strung together also i found it a bit irritating that fred mistreated carole so bad throughout the film and yet true to convention she came running to him in the end uggh there is more suspense in a lassie film will he bring people to rescue timmy or will the rope he is dangling from break br br despite the very very tired and clichÃ©d script there were a few positives about the film it was pretty cool seeing fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn't eaten shaved or slept in days also charles butterworth's prattle did provide a few mildly humorous moments but all this just wasn't enough to make this film look any different than a b movie it's a shame it could have been so much better
<START> beast wars is a show that is over hyped overpraised and overrated let's meet the characters of this obnoxious show whose creators must have been on acid to try and make a show like this br br cheetor seriously they need to have censor bars on this guy how come he dosen't creep out the viewers having the same voice as baby taz at least razzoff from rayman 3 hoodlum havoc is voiced by slip slide action blast if you want a line of show that suck get g4 tranceformers cybertron a show that should go down in a toilet good job creators sarcasm show it self retarded boring at least the super mario games are better this show had a lot of followers sayin' bring it back but i believe that it was cancelled for its own good
<START> i should have figured that any movie with the poltergeist lady in it isn't going to be good it actually starts out okay but during the first murder scene you find out that the movie you're watching is a movie inside of a movie there's people sitting in a movie theatre watching that movie one girl in the audience is so annoying that i would have turned around and strangled her a bit strange but far from good
<START> i'm sure to people watching this move outside of britian this film will be an entertaining watch but for someone from the uk it's painful in it's errors br br right at the start of the film elijah wood gets off a tube at bank station which has been trashed he says to his sister who he's meeting what happened here and she replies oh tottenham were in town yesterday tottenham are in town already they're part of the town they don't have to go there and if tottenham fans wanted to fight other fans the last place on earth they'd do it is bank station where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world br br there are several other similar errors but the biggest failing for me is the actor who plays the lead hooligan he clearly decided it wasn't worth trying to speak with an east end accent and instead opted for a dick van dyke style mock ney which made my ears bleed it was accentuated by the fact the rest of his gang all spoke in the way you'd expect west ham fans to speak this error made him unbelievable in the role and really spoilt the film
<START> i don't like this film but then i didn't think much of the book either which although lauded by many as a masterpiece i found lacking in character development and disjointed and illogical in plot although it was far more readable than fante's dreadful first effort road to los angeles not published until fante became fashionable in the mid 80s br br i was intrigued to see what sort of soup towne would make with such meager ingredients he has worked hard script wise to repair the many shortcomings of the book but for my money didn't rescue it there was never a movie in ask the dust while ever he tried to stay faithful to the book i consider this film towne's folly br br in a word forgettable
<START> the premise of the film is that thomas archer's son was murdered and his wife was brutalized and he is given a chance at revenge when after post traumatic stress disorder therapy he is put in a room with a man strapped to a chair and told this was the culprit he is given a large table of implements with which to offer retribution drills bats nails sledgehammers torches whatever you can think of that someone could possibly want to use to physically hurt another human being br br we go way too many scenes of torture before we figure out that the man archer is torturing is not the man who committed the crime the two then create an uncomfortable alliance who put them in this situation and why br br well when all is said and done we don't really care
