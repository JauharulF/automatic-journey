<START> this is film making at it's simplest and it's best br br i had my doubts because even though freeman is great actor sometimes he gets involved in bad projects this is not one of those times br br it's a small story that runs just over an hour and fifteen in a time when we are getting used to having movies become longer and longer and not necessarily better the director uses the short time to his advantage because the characters are so well defined from the start great portrayals by freeman and vega by the way that the little bit of background info on them seems real morgan is himself even though his name is not mentioned he has been out of movies for a couple of years now because he was saturated by the business and developed a fear to commit to a script and is doing research for a character in a indie movie where he plays a store supermarket manager the story begins by him being drop of in a supermarket in a rough neighborhood where he meets the cashier of the 10 items or less vega and has to take a ride with her cause the production forgot to pick him up br br in many ways it's a road movie morgan provides the laughs and quirks with his unbeatable smile and positive perspective on everything showing off an accomplished actor who has trained his mind to be able to define everyone he sees into a character he could play and paz by the way what an extraordinary beautiful woman even more gorgeous than penelope cruz brings the vulnerability of a 25 years old separated woman who works harder than everyone else without getting any credit in a dead end job at a crappy supermarket br br it's a talkie there is a lot of dialog but the balance between light and fun and serious and sad is well sustained the characters become so lovable right away that you spend the last 20 minutes begging for more screen time of this odd couple but the shortness is in the nature of the story so it was a good call from the director not to give in
<START> after his classic film noir homage chinatown roman polanski returned to the themes that had given him his greatest hits in the 60s with this creepy psychological horror which like repulsion and rosemary's baby deals with the paranoia and claustrophobia generated by apartment living br br claustrophobic environments are the ones which polanski is best at creating and this has to be the most suffocating and confined picture he ever created the emphasis on side walls and distant vanishing points is greater than ever and even in the small number of exterior scenes the sky is rarely glimpsed but the tenant is not just confined spatially but also in the intensity with which it focuses on its protagonist trelkovsky played by polanski himself is not only in every scene he is in virtually every shot when he is not on screen more often than not the camera becomes trelkovsky's point of view and of course almost everywhere he looks he sees his own reflection staring back at him in a mirror br br i can't think of any film that is more about the internalisation and solitude of one character some psychological thrillers like m or peeping tom manipulate us into feeling sorry for the mentally ill protagonist others like psycho attempt in depth scientific analysis of his mental condition the tenant fits into neither of these categories Â it simply immerses us completely inside trelkovsky's experience without demanding we actually understand or appreciate what is going on inside his head we feel his paranoia and obsession even though it is constantly revealed to us that they are irrational br br polanski was also a master of the slowly unfolding horror film often in his horrors there is an ambiguity as to whether there is actually anything sinister going on but they are among the most effective at frightening audiences why precisely because they unfold so slowly and invest so much time in painstakingly setting up situations that they immerse the viewer in paranoia a much later polanski horror the ninth gate is a bit of a mess plot wise but at least it still manages to achieve that creeping sense of dread br br this is a rare chance to see polanski himself in a major role his talent in front of the camera was as good as behind it and he is absolutely perfect as the meek trelkovsky another standout performance is that of the all too often overlooked shelley winters as the concierge in actual fact it is rather a stellar cast although many of the familiar faces look out of place in this strange gothic european movie also sadly many of the french actors in supporting roles are atrociously dubbed in the english language version br br the tenant is more polished and less pretentious than repulsion but it lacks the suspense and the character that make rosemary's baby so engrossing and entertaining the tenant is good with no major flaws and polanski was really on top form as a director but it's not among his most gripping works
<START> written and acted by sincere amateurs produced by some exploitation monger this is dull and hard to watch br br not the worst movie ever but at least schlock like plan 9 from outer space usually had a real actor or two i'd recommend a thief in the night only to hardcore ironists and hardcore dispensationalists i'm neither br br don't believe me watch it for free albeit sourced from poor vhs here http www archive org details thief in the night br br relevant links added mostly to reach imdb's 10 line minimum http en wikipedia org wiki dispensationalism http www dvdtalk com reviews 3199 thief in the night se a
<START> since douglas macarthur affected more human livesÂfor the betterÂthan any other american not elected president he deserved a better film biography not that universal's macarthur is bad it's just not all it should have been br br oddly enough the potential was there from the very early star trek episode the corbomite maneuver 1966 to the recent hbo films something the lord made 2oo4 and warm springs 2oo5 director joseph sargent has emerged as one of the most expressively human directors in film a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional shadings of his actors' performances and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them to go the producer frank mccarthy also gave us patton 197o the legendary jerry goldsmith scored both films and universal widely touted the fact that the film was four years in preparation and production yet for all of this macarthur is perfectly adequateÂand not much more than that br br the film begins in early 1942 shortly before the beleaguered general was orderedÂby president franklin d roosevelt dan o'herlihy Âto flee the philippines to avoid capture by the japanese thus this film omits br br Â· macarthur's birth in 188o in a frontier barracks in arkansas still subject to attack by native american tribesmenÂthus establishing that his remarkable life spanned the distance from bows and arrows to thermonuclear weapons br br Â· his graduation from west pointÂfirst in a class of 95 br br Â· how he joined his famous father general arthur macarthur who had earned the medal of honor at missionary ridge in the civil war on assignments in japan china and most importantly in the philippines br br Â· his heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion into vera cruz br br Â· how he leaped about the trenches of world war one like a mountain goat often wounded and promoted with blinding speed to brigadier general br br Â· his postwar service as west point's youngestÂand most progressiveÂcommandant br br Â· his participation in the court martial of billy mitchell in 1924 br br Â· his routing of the bonus marchers in 1932 br br Â· his efforts to sustain a woefully underfunded army as chief of staff in the early 193o's br br Â· his retirement from the u s army to become field marshal of the army of the philippines br br Â· and the reactivation of his commission by fdr shortly before the outbreak of the second world war br br all this is omitted in favor of prolonged footage of macarthur trying to fight off seasickness while being evacuated by pt boatÂthus we know that general mac is a legend but not why nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so wounding to dugout doug Âand so patently unfounded br br the remainder of his career is presently straightforwardly his island hopping hit 'em where they ain't campaign the fulfillment of his pledge to the filipinosÂ i shall return Âhis crowning achievement the winning of the peace in postwar japan then the difference of opinion with president harry truman a properly feisty ed flanders over the conduct of the korean conflict which resulted in his outright firing and finally his proclamation to congress that old soldiersÂsimply fade away after which he did just that all quite historically accurate and all presented with a very deliberate lack of commentary br br sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval if macarthur's actions appear noble let them be presented as such if they appear egotistical or bombastic let those conceptions register sans comment since joe sargent is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audience's reactionsÂagain see warm springsÂthis refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional historically that may be commendable but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective br br and finally there is a sort of made on the cheap feel to the film as there is to midway released about the same time both films were relegated to television directors sargent in this case jack smight on midway and both have a made for tv look even jerry goldsmith's march while perfectly serviceable lack the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his patton theme just another way in which a larger than life man is memorialized by a very ordinary film br br there was vanity and pettiness in this man inarguably there was also greatnessÂand love him or loathe him one must acknowledge the fact that macarthur did what no military commander before him had done he won the peace br br in the end macarthur Âlike so many film biographiesÂis a good place to begin research into this remarkable man but a poor place to end it
<START> eric valette is obviously a talented film maker and so are the two guys who wrote the script therefore malÃ©fique is a great flick made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination well i'm a bit exaggerating but nevertheless i'm sincere so if you like dark gory movies go and see this one it's really worth it
<START> the beginning of the 90s brought many quirky and off beat independent films a particular sub genre of which is the semi spiritual desert crime movie others of note are wild at heart from dusk til dawn and to a certain extent natural born killers good films like those spawned junk like highway 666 destiny turns on the radio and this ineptly surreal anti masterpiece under the hula moon it's a comedy that aims for a certain emotional tone attains it but keeps going to the point of irritation while the pursuit across the spirit world of the desert and the casting of chris penn are good ideas the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie and isn't focused enough on laughs to really be a comedy i won't blow the ending but let's just say it's bad the film is basically a bad side effect of genre cancer this is the dregs of indie mania
<START> in 1972 after his wife left to go her own way elvis presley began dating linda thompson miss thompson a good humored long haired lovely statuesque beauty queen is charted to fill a void in elvis' life when elvis' divorce became final linda was already in place as the legendary performer's live in girlfriend and travel companion until 1976 br br this is a gaudy look at their love affair and companionship linda whole heartedly tending to her lover's needs and desires and even putting up with his swallowing medications by the handful and introducing her to her own love affair with valium at times this movie is harsh and dark of heart a very unattractive look at the 'king' and his queen br br don johnson is absolutely awful as elvis over acting to the hilt is not attractive stephanie zimbalist lacks the classiness of linda but does the job pretty well supporting cast includes john crawford ruta lee and rick lenz watching this twice is more than enough for me but don't let this review stop you from checking it out for most elvis fans that i have conferred with this is not a favored presentation
<START> i was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this many parts of grey gardens are very funny and unbelievably surreal documentary of not this really gives fellini or david lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes i kept focusing on how these women who are clinically way beyond eccentric reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways and i wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue blood universe perhaps some abuse or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its' own this might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation without going completely over the edge as the edies do their thing i kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble strewn bedroom cats urinating on the bed racoons emerging from holes in the walls and the final scene seemed incredibly sad like a child's birthday party gone seriously wrong very definitely worth seeing and seeking out you'll never forget it but very disturbing
<START> please future writers producers directors learn from this movie br br never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen bold because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movies safely avoided a step to something new creative and daring just when you think 'oh i've seen this before' or 'i am sure this is what will happen now' stardust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the story br br the actors are great even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie robert de niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he's in michelle pfeiffer is the perfect witch and claire danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star' yvaine other big names make outstanding roles i had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie but once again the story by neil gaiman all the little things he 'invented' for this universe simply outstanding br br i watched this movie at a pre screening today a day before the official release and do hope it will have huge success there is so much humor but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes the look in the eyes of yvaine the 'frivolities' of captain shakespeare the passion of lamia the witch impressive unforgettable br br for me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007 watch it and enjoy it br br 11 10 outstanding br br peace and love
<START> melvyn douglas and joan blondell co star in the amazing mr williams a 1939 mystery comedy that's quite good although forgotten probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in 1939 br br douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed what happens in this film is no exception he's called to a murder scene just as he's about to walk down the aisle yet again br br both stars were excellent at comedy worked together well and often and help make this battle of the sexes fun edward brophy and donald mcbride are on hand for excellent support br br as you can read in other reviews melvyn douglas doesn't make much of a woman br br entertaining if a little on the long side br br one of the comments here trashed melvyn douglas one of our greatest actors he literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man he wasn't lazy but rather a very hard working actor who made it look easy who had a broadway career simultaneously with his film career he just wasn't cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system i challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in hud and i never sang for my father and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk
<START> yes i'll say before i start commenting this movie is incredibly underrated br br sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mind br br the acting was good apart from thewlis br br stone really has a talent with this role she's slick naughty and seductive and doesn't look a day older than she did in the first she really impressed me like in casino morrisey was also good he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it thewlis however was lame he ruined his character and was over the top the whole way he really sucked br br overall this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch just ignore thewlis
<START> this is an awesome action film with great one liners from arnie it's stylishly made with lots of tense action to keep one satisfied the characters were awesome and richard dawson is very menacing as the main villain yes it has tons of plot holes however it's highly highly entertaining with a great ending as well it had a great story too it and arnie and maria conchita alonso had great chemistry together the character development was also pretty good with some superb performances the directing is great paul michael glaser does a very good job here with awesome use of colors keeping it stylish throughout awesome camera angles and overall keeping the film at a very fast pace good job there is a little bit of gore we get a few bloody gunshot wounds exploding head slit throat bloody chainsaw slices skinless corpses blood and an impaling the acting is great arnold schwarzenegger is amazing as always he is excellent in the acting department has tons of hilarious one liners kicks that ass and as always is a big physical presence and was tons of fun to watch arnie rules maria conchita alonso does well here she was really cute and had good chemistry with arnie yaphet kotto is decent here with what he has to do which is not much marvin j mcintyre is good as the geeky type guy he was cool richard dawson is awesome as the main villain and was very very menacing and he was fun to watch jesse ventura jim brown erland van lidth gus rethwisch and professor toru tanaka all do what they have to do very well as the stalkers overall a must see 1 2 out of 5
<START> walt disney's the rookie is based on the story of jim morris a former minor league picher who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history ending an almost 10 year retirement and making his major league debut in 1999 at the age of 35 br br the film opens with a brief synopsis of morris' childhood which included a series of re locations his father was a military man and even when his family settled for good in football crazed texas morris' passion for baseball remained strong br br the childhood segment then jumps ahead about 23 years to the adult morris played by dennis quaid who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at big lake high school in real life it was reagan county high school in big lake texas it is mentioned that he attempted a career as a baseball player but that it didn't work out br br morris's team is struggling and he lectures them about giving up on their dreams they turn the table on him telling him that he should try out for a major league team at several times when he pitches to them in practice they express amazement at the speed with which he throws morris seems unconvinced but agrees to a deal with his players in which if they win district he will try out for a major league team br br big lake does win district and adhering to his end of the deal morris attends a tampa bay devil rays try out phenomenally he throws 98 miles an hour faster than he threw during his minor league career and an outstanding speed even for a major league pitcher after another try out with the team morris is offered a contract with the devil rays br br this leaves him with a tough decision stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue his major league dream by going through the minor league grind of making little money and spending months at a time away from home and the decision is even more agonizing than during his first minor league stint because he now has a wife and three children br br morris signs with the devil rays begins at the aa level and moves up quickly to the aaa level one level below major league baseball but as the season winds down the chances of him getting called up grow increasingly slim br br for the most part i love this movie there are lots of great performances and likable characters and it's easy to find yourself really pulling for morris also the movie does a great job portraying professional baseball at both the major and minor league levels and most of all it teaches the timeless message of holding tight to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve br br still the movie has some flaws while generally accurate it exaggerates and even fabricates a few things check out http espn go com page2 s closer 020410 html for some examples also except for one scene in which he prays with his players the movie completely ignores morris' christian faith but considering disney's left wing zeal that's not surprising br br presumably a lot of the exaggerations fabrications were done to make the story more dramatic yet the 20 minute documentary on morris that is included on the dvd features some information that makes his story more dramatic but is excluded from the movie br br for example from birth until his family settled in texas for good when he was 12 morris re located 14 times and his initial minor league career ended after four surgeries through which he lost half of the muscle in his left pitching shoulder thus making his throwing 98 mph even more inexplicable br br to fully appreciate and understand the story of jim morris it's good to not only watch the rookie but to watch the dvd's documentary check out the aforementioned link to the movie's inaccuracies and probably also to read morris' biography also titled the rookie i haven't read the book but i hope to one of these days br br but overall the rookie is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man 8 10
<START> i watched the movie and was dismayed to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience the language would put to shame the street loafers br br the plot a father forcing none of his son to marry seems far fetched br br the idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble minded's attention br br and i was waiting the whole movie for a laugh and laugh i did on my stupidity to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first look br br hope it saves your time
<START> this film is so bad you can't imagine the acting is terrible even worse than in third class soap operas an it is a shame that this movie was the most successful in the past 20 years in switzerland the interactions between the soldiers didn't make any sense at all the story could have been taken out from a bravo photo story the dialogues were as wooden as treebeard and the plot holes were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy but nowadays it doesn't need much to satisfy the audience the actors were handsome for example the former miss switzerland and the main character was even hung woah and there certainly was much abuse of drugs that's real cool man particularly for 12 and 13 year old teens but the media created an atmosphere in witch you was not allowed to reject the film because they manipulated the peer group dynamics by telling implicitly that you are a nerd if you don't go along with the other sheep' and say yes that is exactly what it was like when i was in the army that's exactly what i'm going to do when i must go to the army to every cheesy action that had to do with drugs and coolness and don't think i like the army i was there and i hated it but this film is worse than cleaning up the sticky toilet with a teeth brush which i was forced to do because i offended an lieutenant it is not necessary for every film to be sophisticated sometimes you only want to be entertained for a few hours and forget about problems and i think its not a bad thing but this kind of films influence teenagers to much by showing them a cool lifestyle which in fact is only stupid and turns them into brainless ignorant and egocentric idiots but since i now that my opinion isn't very popular i will be quiet now and recommend you to avoid this terrible flick at any costs and for that to save your wits br br 2 10 br br sorry for my bad english
<START> movie about a small town with equal numbers of mormons and baptists new family moves in cue the overwritten dialog mediocre acting green jello salad with shredded carrots and every other 'inside mormon joke' known to man anyone outside the mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie anyone inside the mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there you'll be much better off watching hess's other movies napoleon dynamite etc than trying to sit through this one the acting is mediocre jared hess has had his hands on much more quality films like saints and soldiers and napoleon dynamite i would recommend both movies over this groaner
<START> my commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film in fact they're quite congruent with mine what gets me is the fact that in terms of a movie it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story motive or dialogue maybe someone should tell neal that substituting lyrics of songs which are failing to inspire anyone outside of a dwindling audience isn't the same thing as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director a silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of neal young the most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero who then finds his way onto the dance floor to mouth the words to young song to the heroine who is unaware of what's taken place somehow these two dream up a scheme where they will go up the west coast in search of sorry neal stick with music and leave film making to steven stills
<START> director sidney lumet has made some masterpieces like network dog day afternoon or serpico but he was not having too much luck on his most recent works gloria 1999 was pathetic and find me guilty was an interesting but failed experiment now lumet brings his best film in decades and by my point of view a true masterpiece before the devil knows you're dead i think this film is like a rebirth for lumet this movie has an excellent story which deeply has many layers also i think the ending of the movie is perfect the performances are brilliant philip seymour hoffman brings as usual a magnificent performance and he's no doubt one of the best actors of our days ethan hawke is also an excellent actor but he's underrated by my point of view his performance in here is great the rest of the cast is also excellent specially the great albert finney but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic oscars the film has a good level of intensity in part thanks to the performances and in part thanks to the brilliant screenplay before the devil knows you're dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction a great screenplay and excellent performances we need more movies like this
<START> gung ho was a good idea however it is to much to ask americans viewers to understand the dynamics of american jobs and foreign competition in this movie the main character hunt stevenson michael keaton goes to japan and convinces a japanese auto company to come to america and help his dying pennslyvania town two things come at you first why would a japanese company come to america to make cars when they do so and so well at that secondly can anyone understand that american companies of all types go to third world nations to have their products made to escape american labor costs it makes the film's premise then that the number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its' top competitors aside from germany and put a plant there as unrealistic keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time but he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but director ron howard can't keep this from becoming a tv movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of japanese and american relations not withstanding gung ho has a happy days and laverne and shirley feel to it as the producers of both tv shows made the film and then made the tv version of this movie as well which gives the film its' lightweight feel the japanese manager gets to love his american workers and feels he and other japanese people can learnfrom americans his no 2 man saito who supposedly doesn't like americans all that much doesn't think so i would have prefered all the japanese characters been like saito than the soft goofball characters they made the japanese out to be it would have made the film more interesting
<START> i don't see much reason to get into this movie in much detail sylvester stallone is once again john rambo author and survivor of a season in hell recruited from prison by his only friend major richard crenna to secretly return to vietnam take photos of the american prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps and return without engaging the enemy br br fat chance what if he actually did nothing more than sneak in take pics and sneak out who would come to see the movie br br it's essentially a celebration of stallone's muscles preparing for his mission we see his well oiled muscles bulging they are oiled and bulging throughout there is the ritual strapping on of black leather ugly guns and even uglier knives the black guns are cleaned assembled with loud clacks and almost as oiled as stallone's muscles the bow is tested and yes it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemy's forehead the knife is sharpened with slick snicks br br stallone and one of his pows are betrayed by one or two of the suits from washington cynical politicians who you can bet were never even in a fist fight in grammar school no guts you know just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer br br the movie does what it set out to do but what it set out to do is meretricious it deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid 1980s that there were uncountable numbers of mias quietly kept in wretched camps by the north vietnamese the bumper stickers were ubiquitous free our mias why would they keep them it was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the pows into a slave labor force in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the united states a propaganda weapon that the vietnamese kept secret from the world br br as a captive rambo is treated in a medieval fashion by the north vietnamese dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists his muscles still on display then not content with subhuman vietnamese a russian officer is brought in to play the part of the gestapo officer vee haff vays of making you remember a high tech type the russian uses psychology and electricity not just pig dump br br rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until this country loves us as much as we love it bringing up another myth that vets returning from vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed which is why i guess we elected so many to the congress and appointed others to high echelon positions the last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group at least rambo's aimless drifting left room open for a sequel which arrived apace br br the action movies with schwarzenegger and willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but rambo is humorless it marches dully through it's phantasmal ideological swamp killing without mercy barely speaking barely able to speak to speak is a sign of weakness
