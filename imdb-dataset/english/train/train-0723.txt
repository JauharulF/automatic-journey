<START> vijay krishna acharya's 'tashan' is a over hyped stylized product sure its a one of the most stylish films but when it comes to content even the masses will reject this one why the films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby script is king without a good script even the greatest director of all time cannot do anything tashan is produced by the most successful production banner 'yash raj films' and mega stars appearing in it but nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland thumbs down br br performances anil kapoor is a veteran actor but how could he okay a role like this akshay kumar is great actor in fact he's the sole saving grace kareena kapoor has never looked so hot she looks stunning and leaves you all stand up saif ali khan doesn't get his due in here sanjay mishra manoj phawa and yashpal sharma are wasted br br 'tashan' is a boring film the films failure at the box office should you keep away
<START> what the heck was this somebody obviously read stephen king and sartre in the same semester we get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror there were moments that were disturbing but each one was canceled out by horrible music cgi or acting br br the problem with weird narratives like this is that it feels lazy even david lynch's work feels like that at times and just like his interesting shows and movies it runs far far too long and sadly this is only 98 minutes br br the cast was attractive and that is about the limit to this i suppose it touches on feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have but just doesn't make the characters likable enough for us to care about their fates whatever they were the final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous
<START> i'm starting to think that there's a conspiracy all right one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film despite its obscurity will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a universal acclaim or something within that range thus ensuring unsuspecting folk like me will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing expecting a surprise only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck br br this movie is one of them it has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article i come across because it's rather clear that two things might have happened either i didn't get the message that is so hidden beneath this film's inner realms as to be impossible to access or they and i watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name 4 is a dirty trick on the audience it's no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say smorsgabord and that despite the rating it got on metacritic no one had heard of it it's terrible with sugar on top br br firstly there is the ever present number four from start to finish while having a little symbolism here and there is okay and it's been done with various degrees of success in many well known movies this movie is panting with it four dogs at the start of the movie looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt four people in a bar although one of them is a non entity three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless not only to each other but to what their lives are not while this concept may work the movie meanders so much particularly with the story of the would be model played by marina vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre and not in a good way that the initial theme gets lost in translation or maybe like i said before i just didn't get it the problem also lies in that so much time is spent on marina's story which revolves on the death of her sister from bread chewing no less and the subsequent shrill mourning which follows that any interest in the inherent surrealism dissipates without a trace so what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own the director doesn't invest much time in truly tying them together or weaving a tighter story that could in a david lynchian way intersect either with the past present or within alternate dimensions or even as a straightforward mundane science fiction story this is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint or someone into the weird for weird's sake could endure
<START> super slick entertainment with a stellar cast an outstanding script and a firm grip on the approaching 1950's at the time rko was turning out classic noirs by the dozens but whatever the value of those shadowy downers they reflected a war time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the eisenhower era few films of the late 40's are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy br br jim blandings cary grant works as an ad man on madison ave where in his little daughter's words he sells things to people that they don't need at prices they can't afford he's making good money but like thousands of others he's tired of living in a cramped urban cave so with wife myrnah loy they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the connecticutt countryside needless to say in the arms of nature they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion br br there's hardly a lifeless line in the entire script i don't know if writers panama and frank got an oscar but they should have of course the humor revolves around all the problems that pop up when city people build a big house on rural land the annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving grant a hard time of course no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than grant so it's just one well placed laugh after another particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own yet oddly the film appears to have no comedic high point instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don't peak at any particular point that's a real movie triumph for any era br br reaching back 60 years later we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind with their live in maid the blandings may not be a typical american family but that post war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical and what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than blandings as an ad man tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more ham more than anything however there's the movie's sunny optimism oh sure the feeling falters at times yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the blandings just stick to their dream carries them through indeed life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge so i expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day it's that easily over looked subtext along with the sheer entertainment value that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post war period br br so if you haven't seen it catch it next time around
<START> i would almost give it 10 out of 10 however there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are miss leading which hurt the flow continuity of the film the story line is great and well composed you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it the characters are complicated and so is the story line expect to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head it's a film where all is explained in the end the animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film that is unlike anything else i've seen in animation it is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scenes so it's worth watching it on a good t v or plasma the character voices do save this film in its english version but it would have been more convincing if there were some french accents to emphasize that its happening paris i enjoyed it more in french with english subtitles one the whole its well worth buying on dvd or blueray if they have it and personally if you enjoyed this film you might also like waking life ghost in a shell 2 innocence this is just a personal suggestion
<START> do not ever watch this film it is the biggest pile of sh te i have ever come across in my whole life and thats saying something the acting storyline and filming were absolutely dire this is the worst film in the world seriously doesn't it even give you a hit seeing as it cost my 99p from sainsburys and it was only made in 2005 hahaha this film is like a cheap college movie you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen although if u really wanna watch it you gotta watch the scary shark scene possibly the best piece of acting i have seen in my life ha ha i mean seriously this is the biggest waste of 2 1 2 hours ever
<START> watching this last night it amazed me that fox spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment it's the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed br br i'm sure that the first morning of filming raquel welch dusted off the shelf over her fireplace to prepare a spot for the academy award she would surely win for this daringly original movie oops that's not what happened br br the infighting on the set was detailed in print by rex reed and this helped the movie attain a reputation before it was even released when it was finally released there wasn't the usual three ring circus of publicity if i remember correctly in houston it opened at drive ins and neighborhood theatres and never played any of the big venues br br i lay most of the blame on director michael sarne who was hot after having directed the not all that good joanna a film with music about young people in swinging mod london br br if i recall correctly fox wound up firing him and piecing the film together the best they could that's why scenes play out in no particular sequence and characters appear and then vanish an impressive supporting cast kathleen freeman jim backus john carradine andy devine and others is wasted with nothing to do br br to expand it to feature length there are numerous clips from fox movies featuring stars like carmen miranda in amazing footage from the gang's all here andlaurel and hardy who never dreamed they'd be playing in an x rated movie br br the x rating is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions however none of the characters seem to be having any fun maybe somebody involved with the film had a warped puritan sensibility and figured that if they could make these things unappealing it wasn't bad to exploit them br br this was one of the youth pictures that nearly bankrupted hollywood in the 1970's one writer joked that easy rider which was made for pocket change was the most expensive movie ever made because so many films followed which tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate its success sixtyish once honored directors like stanley kramer and otto preminger made movies like rpm and skidoo in an effort to attract a young audience white directors and writers attempted to make films to attract a black audience those movies are locked somewhere in a vault and the two named and many others from that genre have never as best i know been out on home video or cable they're the studios' deep dark secret br br raquel welch's performance in this is all things considered very good with the right direction and script she could played the type of sassy liberated women rosiland russel and barbara stanwyck specialized in she looks great and has awesome costumes mae west is the liveliest seventy something actress i've ever seen on the one hand it's kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years gone by but i'm sure she needed the money br br if you want to see a big budget x rated movie from this era check out beyond the valley of the dolls also from fox because it doesn't take itself seriously it's crazy kids playing with the equipment at a major studio myra breckinridge tries to say something there just wasn't anyone who wanted to listen
<START> it's amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction what a great movie br br i've never much cared for brad pitt though his turns in 12 monkeys and fight club show improvement but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving dark and right on target br br everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie's slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening br br the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book is that compared to what came before it the ending is a bit too long and overblown but that's the only flaw i could find in this cult classic br br if you check this film out try to get the letterboxed unrated director's cut for the best viewing option br br rating 9
<START> if the lion king was a disney version of hamlet then the lion king 3 hakuna matata is a disney version of guildenstern and rosencrantz are dead just like tom stoppard's beguiling film we get to view the action from the point of view of two of the minor characters from the original timon the meerkat with a penchant for breaking into song at the drop of a hat and pumbaa the warthog with flatulence issues by following their story rather than simba's we get to see why all the animals bowed down as simba was presented from pride rock we find out what made timon and pumbaa decide to follow simba back to pride rock to oust scar and we find out how they dealt with the hyena's once and for all nathan lane as timon gets most of the best jokes but he is ably supported by ernie sabella as pumbaa it is also good to hear matthew broderick and whoopi goldberg reprising their roles julie kavner and jerry stiller lend their distinctive voices to two new characters timon's mother and uncle the only downside is the constant stop start rewind fast forward device which doesn't always help to progress the story having said that there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie with more laughs than any other third in a disney series movie hakuna matata is worth watching if only for the hot tub scene which is still funny despite being a little bit predictable
<START> its great i loved it ha cause i love dinosaurs they r the greatest animals but i loved the show cause it wasn't copied from another show and it was a originals ha it has a good storyline and great for little kids if they like dinosaurs that is i have a few downs too its not all that great cause of the dinosaurs look a little mutated so i should have had but a 7 but right now is a little late for that yay 4 more lines to go it is great for a fantasy show though warning this might spoil a part for u so if u don't want it to be spoiled don't read on plz near the end is kinda weird cause all they need to do is get dang i forgot what it was so nvm guess its not a spoiler so never mind i loved it and its my opinion and sorry for any missed spelled words if any
<START> christopher lloyd is funny and really believable as al the head angel this movie is much better than the first but it has great special effects that the first did not have as well as a much better plot and writing br br ok it was written for kids but adults have as much fun as the kids do tony danza does a very realistic job in his role but this is not a taxi reunion br br danny glover is actually good and even seems to be very human in his emotions as well as showing some real acting talent for a change a pleasant change br br watch at least once it is worth the effort to catch it
<START> i've watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing i haven't been this interested in an anime series since neon genesis evangelion this series is actually based off an h game which i'm not sure if it's been done before or not i haven't played the game but from what i've heard it follows it very well br br i give this series a 10 10 it has a great story interesting characters and some of the best animation i've seen it also has some great japanese music in it too br br if you haven't seen this series yet check it out you can find subbed episodes on some anime websites out there it's straight out of japan
<START> tony goldwyn is a good actor who evidently is trying his hand at directing a walk on the moon appears to have borrowed from other better made films the present story takes place in the late sixties at a summer resort for working class jews not far from woodstock the screen treatment by pamela gray doesn't have much going for it so it's a puzzle why mr goldwyn decided to tackle this film as his first attempt at direction br br the kantrowitz family is spending some time at the resort we see them arrive at the small bungalow that is going to be their temporary home marty the father comes only for the week end he works in what appears to be a family small appliance business repairing television sets mostly in a few days the first man will walk in space so the excitement is evident br br the kantrowitz women are left behind pearl marty's wife and her mother in law lilian spend idle days in the place until the blouse salesman arrives pearl goes browsing and she finds much more than a shmatte she gets the salesman as well it appears that pearl and marty have no sexual life at all after two children pearl who appears to be sexy and with a high libido is ready for some extra marital fun br br that is the basic premise for the film which becomes a soap opera when the young daughter alison decides to play hooky and go to the woodstock festival nearby where horror of horrors she witnesses her own mom making out with the blouse salesman what's a girl to do well stay tuned for the grand finale when all the parties are happily reunited by the little son's bedside when he is stung by wasps and the salesman comes to apply some home remedy and daddy is called from the city after knowing about pearl's betrayal with the younger stud br br poor diane lane she went to make unfaithful later on which is the upscale version of this dud viggo mortensen is the salesman who caters to his lonely female customers whispering little somethings in their ears liev schreiber as marty the cuckolded husband doesn't have much to do anna paquin plays the rebellious alison and tovah feldshuh is the unhappy nana who would like to have stayed in the city watching her soap operas instead of witnessing first hand one that is playing in her own backyard br br watch it at your risk or pop the dvd in the telly when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want to have a laugh or two dishing the film
<START> i never heard of this film til it played as part of a robert mitchum retrospective at the national film theatre in london almost 60 years on the cast list looked tasty to say the least with seven names in addition to top billed mitchum in the public domain charles mcgraw not long off the killers barbara bel geddes long before dallas and arguably still better known as the daughter of theatre set designer norman walter brennan who needed no introduction frank faylen the sadistic male nurse in the lost weekend and the much nicer small town mensch in it's a wonderful life robert preston still a decade away from harold hill in the music man with tom tully and phyllis thaxter making up the numbers alas most of them were wasting their time i looked in vain for any 'signature' scenes given that it was robert wise on bullhorn by this time he'd made around a half dozen films and had still to find a style the story is our old friend the range war and mitchum must have thought it was barely a cut above the hopalong cassidy oaters on which he'd cut his teeth there are no new twists if you don't count the unbelievable scene when mitchum accuses preston of sleeping with thaxter to gain information about her father's plans to move his cattle this is perfectly true but how did mitchum know we've seen or heard nothing to indicate how he discovered it on balance not a lot to be said for this
<START> first off with names like fred olen ray brinke stevens and jan michael vincent plus distributors like rhino and troma on the video box you know what you're getting into with this one b movie mania if you're actually expecting to see a thriller based on edgar allan poe then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of roger corman 60s poe films this is pure unadulterated sleaze with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to the premature burial complete with lots of r rated ready for video sex and nudity however it's certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way br br brinke who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes plays rich traumatized insomniac housewife victoria monroe whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father hoke howell her worthless husband terry jay richardson has racked up some serious gambling debt owed to a gangster played by robert quarry and with help from his kinky blonde european accented sexpot secretary lisa delia sheppard plots to do away with brinke for her money name value actress karen black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist she's way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this 50s sci fi horror star robert clarke plays a doctor and family friend and michael berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still living vicki jan michael vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo goo eyes as brinke enters and exits the home br br the kill a spouse for the inheritance plot has been done a million times before the ending is an unintentional laugh riot concluding with a direct rip off of the zuni fetish doll segment in trilogy of terror and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head fx for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic but the biggest surprise of all is how good former penthouse pet delia sheppard is in her role she stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here
<START> well first off if you're checking out revolt of the zombies as some very early night of the living dead 1968 type film forget it this is about zombies in a more psychological sense where that term merely denotes someone who is not in control of their will but who must instead follow the will of another the zombies here as little as they are in the film are largely metaphors for subservience to the state or authority in general as in wartime it is quite a stretch to call this a horror film br br the film is set during world war i a french cambodian contingent had heard strange stories about zombification supposedly angkor wat was built by utilizing zombies and there are tales of zombie armies easily overcoming foes armand louque dean jagger brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification but he won't talk so louque and an international military contingent head to angkor wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to wipe out the white race br br one of the odd things about revolt of the zombies is that it seems like maybe writer director victor halperin decided to change his game plan while shooting the script the film begins as if it will explore the zombie military metaphor and maybe even have adventure elements but after about 15 minutes it changes gears and becomes more of a love triangle story br br halperin does stick with a subtext about will and power and a nietzschean will to power the film is interesting on that level but the script and the editing are very choppy this is yet another older film for which i wouldn't be surprised if there is missing footage especially since some scenes even fade or cut while a character is uttering dialogue br br amidst the contrived romance story halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread but little of the zombie material makes much sense louque discovers the secret of zombification but it doesn't mean much to the viewer the mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusingÂhalperin even resorts to using superimposed footage of bela lugosi's googly eyes from his 1932 film white zombie but never explains what it has to do with anything there are big gaps in the plot including the love story promising interesting characters from early reels disappear for long periods of time one potential villain is disposed of unceremoniously before he gets to do much br br if you're a big fan of old creaky b movies revolt of the zombies may be worth watching at least once the acting isn't all that bad and if you've got a good imagination you can piece together an interesting story in your mind to fill in all of the gaps but this is the second time i've seen the film with the first only being about five years ago and i could barely recall anything about it so it's not exactly memorable
<START> sadly the print of the film we were going to watch burned in the fire at universal studios last week so we were stuck with video that could even be a metaphor for this second rate king kong movie from toho studios' stalwart director ishiro honda essentially it's a warm up for king kong versus godzilla it even uses the idea of a mecha kong like mecha godzilla of course the movie climaxes with king kong fighting mecha kong on top of the expo tower in tokyo but if you didn't know that already then maybe you're in the age group that this movie was intended for br br the cast is headed by a guy named rhodes reason who we had never heard of glancing over his list i see mostly a lot of scattered american tv credits so it's interesting that they dragged him all the way to japan so that they could have a nominal american hero the real hero of the movie is the more sensitive japanese commander played by akira takarada who i recognized from hiroshi inagaki's iconic version of chushingura 47 ronin and also from the original godzilla films by honda i'm sorry rhodes reason whoever you are but this guy has way more screen presence and you can bet that everyone wants him to end up with the cute little blonde played by linda miller we laughed at the way reason would always find a way to interject himself between miller and takarada who it seemed like she kind of preferred of course like all kong leading ladies her primary relationship is with the king himself she discovers a nice trick if you talk to a giant ape really really slowly he'll understand what you're saying and if you're a blonde gal that means that he'll do whatever you tell him to do that fact is not lost on dr who eisei amamoto and madame piranha mie hama representing a nation which shall not be named who plan on using her as bait to get kong to dig up mineral deposits that are trapped at the north pole br br yes this is truly the plot of the whole movie apparently only a giant ape is going to be capable of digging out these minerals which can be used to make super powerful weapons dr who builds mecha kong to get it but the circuitry gets in the way so they decide to go for the real kong kong himself seems momentarily infatuated with mecha kong a story element that might have made the film more interesting but wasn't followed up on br br by the end of the movie the cute blonde has shouted kong or king kong in her chirpy voice so many times that when the two heroes tell her to let him go at the end they're speaking for all of us basically this movie squanders whatever majesty was possible in the kong character by making him a heroic and friendly figure much too early just like the newest version of the story kong is just a guy in a suit in this movie and they show quite a lot of him to the point where the goofy face becomes impossible to take seriously it's a nice looking movie i'm sure it satisfies the demands or desires of fans of this type of thing which is really more of a wrestling film than a monster film in a lot of ways the monsters don't ever really scare in these films they just jump around and push each other around a lot it's not a worthless movie but it's extremely predictable and formulaic so for anyone under the age of 10 or so it probably will only be entertaining as comedy
<START> one of the best movies for all ages you will never be able to look at lion king again without thinking of the extra history this movie adds nearly 40 years old i watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight i have not laughed enjoyed a movie so much in a long time br br take time out and watch this with the kids it will remind you of how disney used to be when you were a young one
<START> i had high expectations for this movie and was excited about renting it but was very disappointed when i saw it it was very poorly written and sort of just fell apart there wasn't a lot of good anything in this movie except maybe special effects
<START> i watched this movie in the wee hours of the morning when i should have been asleep this in itself was testimony that deliverance was a spell binding movie i think boorman did a wonderful job on directing this film how expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the dueling banjos was done it showed so well and early on how inherently reserved and simple the people of the area were case in point near the end of the duel the banjo playing boy was smiling loved his banjo but when drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the duel the kid was too reserved to respond the river trip never left you bored for sure the rape scene was brutal but necessary to show just what the group was up against in this backwoods area of georgia i think beatty's traumatic shock afterward was well done some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal i disagree if you really payed attention he was unresponsive during the entire action immediately following in which reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they chased off the toothless guy it was confusing when ed killed the other guy later at the top of the cliff it almost appeared that the arrow was shot while ed was curled up and expecting to die but then you realize the arrow he had shot earlier had finally taken effect br br anyway a great movie and i was wavering between an 8 and 9 on my vote but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave it a 1 i gave it a 10 this individual's reasoning seemed based on personal bias rather than an objective viewpoint and his vote was obviously a non correlating attempt to lower the rating
