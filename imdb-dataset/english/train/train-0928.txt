<START> 'presque rien' is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual eschewing both stereotypes and preaching it's a wonderfully naturalistic film superbly acted shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place never melodramatic but often painfully real if anything it's almost too realistic as there's little in the way of conventional plot just scenes from a life but the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn 'presque rien' might not be the most exciting film ever made but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the pre conceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme worth a watch
<START> ok don't let my summary fool you this movie sucks hard but the worst movie ever this movie was terrible in ways people shouldn't have to rack their brains to describe but it is in no way worse than manos the hands of fate hobgobblins horrors of spider island or a small handful of movies as a review the movie sucks it's terrible don't see it with out mst or you may develop health problems but there are worse movies
<START> don't think of this movies as just another kids movie the whole family can enjoy it its a strange mix of a movie as its seems to have a movie within it but at least it does make sense at the end unlike modern films it does give you all the elements of a film decent plot good characters well it does star the muppets a list of lesser celebs which films would clamour for what is surprising is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions some sad some heartwarming some funny and some serious it all makes an enjoyable family film that everyone can watch together br br the celebs in the film are actually top stars of the day but there is only one true star of the film and no one dare outshine miss piggy
<START> witchery might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but luckily enough it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense but who cares when linda blair with an exploded hairstyle portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer who can't seem to get laid in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo sewn shut lips upside down crucifixions vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of massachusetts the young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history the dysfunctional family with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are considers re opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex they're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady Â an aging actress or something who always dresses in black Â starts taking them out in various engrossing ways everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window anyway the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin off of the evil dead the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film there's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried
<START> here's another movie that should be loaded into a satellite fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip off of the already bad movie classic king kong from 1976 that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness but successfully predicted much of peter jackson's miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name as far as a romance between the giant here a yeti and a gorgeous human female antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzi's city of the living dead who is very easy on the eyes br br the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness but as a trade off you do get a wacky old scientist two inquisitive kids tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti who turns out to be the good guy glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands a monster who's size literally changes scale from shot to shot some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison crowd reaction shots a plenty made up of either spanish italian or canadian extras depending upon scene you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie br br it's here that the film won me over it's enthusiasm just for being made frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in 1968 and god's gun the year before this was a very important director in the spaghetti western and action adventure genre film scene from the 1960's 1970's and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever or rather the one he took the most chances with and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids families the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless or rather they are part of the fun and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn't have worked which is exactly why peter jackson's movie sucked br br he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators and with all it's faults clunkiness kramer's yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space i'd rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever because the movie looks so fake you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked trampled tossed about and smashed knowing that and armed with a fertile energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid br br 10 10 it's about ten minutes too long but who cares you only come around once and i'd rather go out with a smile on my face
<START> while watching this movie i came up with a script for a movie called the making of 10 items or less br br producer i've got good news and bad news the good news is we can get morgan freeman br br writer that's great but what's the bad news br br producer we can only afford to hire him for one day i guess we'll have to get someone else br br writer so we hire him for one day a movie is an hour and a half long a work day is eight hours long i fail to see a problem br br producer but he'll have to spend time getting into character br br writer so we have him play a character who is essentially himself br br producer but he'll still need to understand his motivation and all that you're not saying we have him play a big name actor that's doing a low budget movie are you br br writer why not br br producer that's ridiculous but fine at least we'll have morgan freeman in our movie and i guess we have to set the movie in los angeles too br br writer of course br br producer this script is a load of crap we'd better make money on this just in case have morgan freeman's character plug wal mart or target or one of those stores so at least someone will want to sell the dvds br br writer sure thing br br producer wait a second what's this about a tiny bodega with a ten items or less express lane br br writer oh i guess that is pretty weird but we can't change the title now br br i doubt my script actually bears much resemblance to reality but then neither did 10 items or less this is a case of good acting but bad writing and i hate to see it happen when watching an independent movie you expect it to try to convey some sort of message i think they might have been trying for the tired old don't let anything hold you back message that has been done to death in much better films in any case with 10 items or less the only message i got was look look at morgan freeman
<START> what ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time well he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could've been directed by anybody available out of film school and in fact they probably would've done a better job they would've at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script br br mark wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes gasp except this time around the apes squirm through groan worthy dialogue nonsensical plotting and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could've been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered 'masterpiece' next to this tripe br br as much as i enjoy the superb acting talent that is tim roth his performance as evil ape leader thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing luckily for him the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles br br and alas the always dependable hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause and the haha we're so clever aren't we way that hollywood intermingles references from the original pota into this one sigh br br instead of seeing this spend the night in and call up some friends and rent 'ed wood' 'edward scissorhands' 'batman' or even to a lesser extent 'sleepy hollow' and reminisce about the days when tim burton was a man of vision and originality not shame and ridicule
<START> this movie was awesome it made me laugh it make a bawl and most of all it has talking animals in it this movie should be seen by all kinds of people it is one of my favorite movies and i just love it so much that i just had to comment on it it rox it is so heart felt and a wonderful storyline that makes up a great and heartfelt movie my favorite character is shadow this is because i think that he is the most interesting and charming i used to have a golden retriever just like shadow i miss him so much he was my best friend and i knew that when he died he would be in a happier place but i miss him with all of my heart this movie is the best i love it and everyone should love your pets no matter what they do cherish them forever
<START> the week before i saw iowa i saw art school confidential in which a pretentious student makes a film and can't decide whether he wants it to be art or violent exploitation iowa could be the film that he made i can see elements of much better movies in iowa spun and natural born killers however in addition to artiness both those movies had good character development and coherent story lines iowa this movie stumbles to a preposterous end i have to admit that it had consistency this movie is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better in any part the actors all did what they could roseanna arquette deserves better she demonstrates that she is very talented very funny and very sexy but why does she have to demonstrate it in this turd ball
<START> a great film this and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on channel four br br the plot is a simple one but works very effectively the blurring between child like fantasy and hard hitting nightmare is very well blurred the budget looks pretty low but to the credit of those involved it doesn't show too often it also hasn't dated that much either br br i was lucky enough to tape this off the telly when it was on a few years ago and it has withstood half a dozen viewings it's one of those films that won't appeal to all though as usual those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would get a lot out of this br br charlotte buerke puts in a good performance as anna the spoilt brat and it is a shame she seems to have gone from the acting scene cross is also very good carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picture br br there are some genuinely and i don't say that lightly disturbing moments in this film both half second shockers and more drawn out tensions watch it with the lights out br br highly recommended br br 9 10 br br
<START> i had to shut this off after about 15 execrable moments br br i was hoping it might improve br br what i saw was badly acted directed written br br this movie should never even have been released directly to dvd br br the lead character who is a bride top be from hell has an huge ice sculpture fall on her killing her she was such a revolting person i was not even sorry for her she winds up there in a sort of heaven was still repulsive i left shortly after br br eve longoria portrays her i hope i never see her again she cant even act she is just plain annoying br br paul rudd an actor who normally can do no wrong also was in this dud br br jason biggs no longer a teen is also present br br i do like comedies but not stupid ones about stupid people br br rating out of 4 30 points out of 100 imdb 2 out of 10
<START> this film was released the year i was born and will be like me 70 in 2007 i watched it again last night having not seen it since high school while it was full of 30's sentiment and the acting was a bit stereotyped nevertheless it was superb pearl s buck's story did come alive through the magic of the chemistry of luise rainer and paul muni the novel which earned ms buck the nobel prize for literature comes alive under the baton of sydney franklin which along with an excellent script recounts the story of peasant farmer wang lung whose father obtains a bride for him a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord in buck's story wang's success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife most of the time and the love of the land in the end he comes to realize that his wife like the land is the source of his wealth happiness and immortality buck's stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre feminist world the german born luise rainer brings a tentative but determined peasant chinese woman to life in her portrayal of olan muni likewise captures the naive but honorable wang eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant other classic characters include charlie grapewin dorothy gale's kansan uncle henry from the wizard of oz walter connelly as the mewing conniving uncle and keye luke as number one son but this time not charlie chan's br br a classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of if that's indeed the case this film is a classic no doubt whatsoever
<START> this an free adaptation of the novels of clarence mulford fans of the willaim boyd films will probably feel a little at sea here and the reviews here so far reflect that but i knew of hopalong from the novels first and never cared much for the boyd films once i got around to them br br christopher coppola has made a wise choice he has not made a nostalgic western instead he has approached the cassidy story as a slice of what we used to call 'americana' or what older critics once called 'homespun' as the film unraveled i found myself more and more reminded of the great hallmark theater version of mark twain's roughing it with james garner narrating br br both these films remind us that although films about the 'old west' are probably always to be mythic for americans they need not be 'westerns' they can very well be just films about what it meant to be american in that time in that place br br i never feel pandered to watching this film there's no effort to shove the boyd cassidy legacy down our throats no irony no camp consequently i get a sense of these characters as having walked or ridden horseback across some real western america i too could have walked a hundred years ago br br given that the plainness of the film it positively avoids anything we have come to call style is all to its favor and the plain acting of the performers fits neatly in with this gosh it really does feel like some story told around a campfire on a cattle drive no visual dressing just the quirks and good humor and sudden violence that we expect from the good narration of an adventure yarn i was very pleasantly surprised by this film and if the viewer sets aside encultured expectations he or she will find considerable pleasure in it br br i would have given this film 9 stars but i'll give it a ten just because most reviewers here have missed the point completely and i urge them to set their memories of boyd aside and give this film another chance br br note 1 a reviewer complained that hopalong shoots people dead in this film rather than shooting the guns out of their hands ala boyd's cassidy first cassidy does shoot people dead in the novels second if cassidy were a real cowboy he would have shot people dead the problem with shooting guns out of people's hands is that they can always get another gun which happens to be part of the subtext of this very film br br note 2 i admit that i am jealous of the coppola family that they have the director of the godfather among them who can get them all opportunities to make movies that i can't but a good movie is a good movie and this is a good movie if it's by somebody by the name coppola well that's just is as it is america is the land of opportunity or was until bush got into office that's what the great american novels are all about
<START> i saw this movie not knowing anything about it before hand the plot was terrible with large gaps of information missing the movie didn't have the battle of wits feel to me the actors just spewed out mouthful's of nonsense at times causing me to gnash my teeth in agony as they droned on and on the plot was predictable except for the stomach sickening homo erotic scene at the end i'm not homophobic but made me physically sick to my stomach even the ending was predictable and you could tell the detective was jude law in a costume everything from the fake accent terrible dental work costume shop facial hair everything pointed to it being a disguise the whole movie just felt like wasted time out of my life this movie had the feel of a puppet show with jude law and michael caine as puppets and the house as the window to view the show really boooring in my opinion
<START> this movie was so predictable its a complete rip off of those i was abused by daddy i'm gonna kill women movies stupid scenes bad acting unoriginal storyline really low budget piece of crap film br br don't waste your time people trust me br br my rating 0 5 0
<START> for anyone who has only seen disney productions beautifully animated version of 'beauty the beast' or even jean cocteau's surreal fairy tale vision will be quite taken aback by this 1975 french but with a director from poland version the plot concerns a french family of fading aristocracy that is marrying into a well to do english family the major catch is that the bridegroom is carrying an ancient curse on the family the film also includes many flashback sequences potentially explaining this family curse from the opening credits to the very end it's a nearly non stop erotic fun house ride with some very explicit graphic sexual content hence the film's x rating in the u s in it's initial run which is now unrated the film's somewhat contemptuous sentiment at the ruling class will probably remind one of bunuel's flights into similar territory if you have a taste for the truly bizarre and are not offended by taboo material then this film may just scratch that itch for you
<START> this is an excellent fast paced thriller by wes craven nightmare on elm street who for 85 minutes leaves aside the supernatural and presents us with something even more terrifying the evil of human beings we are far more likely to encounter the benign evil of jackson rippner than freddy kruger and cillian murphy batman begins does an excellent job of presenting a sociable friendly even charismatic killer the performances by murphy and by rachel mcadams claire from the wedding crashers are brilliant most of the film takes place on a very intimate level between two people their eyes their faces it is action on a small scale not the broad sweep of the canvas and it is no less compelling for these limitations the cinematography is nothing special though of course one can do only so much with a camera in the confines of a passenger jet but the dialog is excellent the story taut there are no distractions no subplots confuse the issue which is at its heart a battle between the main characters by keeping his focus and avoiding distractions wes craven is able to take what is a very minimal plot and turning it into an exciting fast paced action thriller
<START> inventor wayne szalinsky rick moranis is preparing to donate his problematic shrinking expanding machine to the smithsonian institution as he and his wife diane eve gordon get ready for a long weekend away from their son adam bug hall wayne's brother gordon stuart pankin his wife patty robin bartlett and his kids jenny allison mack and mitch jake richardson volunteer to look after adam while his parents are away but as luck would have it and the title would lead you to expect the grown ups are accidentally zapped by wayne's shrinking ray as the kids run amok their miniaturized folks must contend with monstrously huge insects wrinkles in the carpet that look like canyons and other threats to them this was bad like most straight to video sequels are honey we shrunk ourselves was sort of laughable i had to laugh at that movie roach stuart pankin and the party bullies were even more ridiculous view at own risk
<START> no comment stupid movie acting average or worse screenplay no sense at all skip it
<START> i loved long way round and wasn't even aware of race to dakar until i saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket i bought it and after a slightly 'hmm will this be as good' first episode i decided that it was charlie boorman was great as were the other members of the crew great to see him with ewan again there was a fair bit of swearing in it but that didn't bother me as for their being no mention of it on the package thats more to do with the silly excempt from classification certificate that the bbfc have they should have given it a 15 just for the language alone br br highly recommended series i want more
