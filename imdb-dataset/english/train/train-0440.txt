<START> class reunion is a very underated comedy gem it's 1982 and the 1972 class of lizzie borden high return for there 10 year reunion among them are the usual stereotypes the hunk babe the fat guy nerd etc but the former students are in for a bumpy night one of their classmates is walter baloer the class wimp who was subject to a comedy prank by the rest of the class on graduation night and since then has been in a mental home walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation br br despite the dark premise this is really just an excuse for lots of very funny gags set pieces to say too much more would spoil the film but if you enjoyed the naked gun airplane movies you'll love this what other film offers a music cameo by chuck berry a great comedy which deserves a wider audience
<START> should have been titled 'balderdash ' little in the film is true except the name of the island and the fact submarines were involved little more than training film quality with poor camera work muddy stock footage and perhaps the low point of stereotyping 'japs' with laughing japanese infantry laughing japanese fighter pilots and one dimensional square jawed americans dying left and right sixty years later it is unintentionally funny as an odd artifact and as an opportunity to see what is possible when the war fever is upon you the plot and the dialogue remind me of playing guns on a summer's afternoon in my childhood peering through the neighbor's hedge to gain a fatal advantage on my best friend steve and my little brother in actual fact the makin island raid was a near total failure with carlson and his men wandering around in the dark exchanging gunfire with shadows until finally thirsty and completely disoriented looking for someone to surrender to before they happened upon some equally confused japanese soldiers who promptly surrendered to them in the withdrawal several of carlson's marines ended up on another island and were abandoned the film of course couldn't tell that story not in 1943 so this bit of whimsy was fabricated and rushed into release to the beating of drums with randolph scott and his jaw as colonel thorwald carlson leading a unit comprised almost entirely of stock caricatures the green recruit harry landon robert mitchum the grizzled veteran j carroll naish milburn stone sam levene the country bumpkin rod cameron the all american boy alan curtis and scores of sneering when they weren't laughing 'japs' and yet the cast nearly overcomes the material almost randolph scott's narrow range is well suited to his role of earnest commander and he is supported by a solid group of professionals who do their best with thin gruel but in the end the one note object of the exercise wins any pretense is totally abandoned at the close when randy scott simply looks directly into the camera and delivers a stirring well sorta stirring call to arms the cast was better than this material so was the audience should be viewed with reefer madness and a bottle of moderately priced merlot
<START> i am very disappointed with this movie because i like these french actors and i liked buffet froid from this director bertrand blier but the script of les acteurs is very poor why these actors they agreed to play this poor scenario
<START> how can you gather this respectable cast of young british actors and come up with such a pile of filmic manure horrible script annoyingly hectic camera awfully edited gruesomely badly acted only rhys ifans tries to fill his role with life another painful proof that different sometimes equals dreck why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand do yourself a favour spare yourself and do something else like hitting a mallet onto your knees it's less painful and more fun than this movie
<START> contains slight spoilers br br it's interesting how anthony mann uses james stewart here stewart is of course remembered by many as george bailey from frank capra's it's a wonderful life so it's easy to find parallels between the two films in it's a wonderful life bailey gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born in the far country stewart's jeff webster by not getting involved to help anyone else except himself gets to see essentially the same thing a world in which he for all practical matters doesn't exist br br by not getting involved and by attempting not to care about anyone webster is forced to see those for whom he can't help but care get hurt pushed around and even killed while he stands by and does nothing this reminds the viewer of george bailey watching a world that has turned upside down because he has also decided not to get involved by not ever having been born br br both movies end with the same image a close up of a ringing bell stewart by turning around his philosophy of non involvement has it would seem earned his wings
<START> some wonder why there weren't anymore mrs murphy movies after this one will it's because this movie totally blew snot disney was not the right studio to run this film maybe touchstone well they're owned by disney but it'd be more adult the film is too kid ish as the book series is not the casting is all wrong for the characters the characters don't even act the way they do in the books and why was tucker changed to a guy he's a girl in the frigging books was this done to make the film appeal to boys sheesh and where was pewter the gray cat one of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth rita mae brown is a good writer but letting disney blow her work was wrong an animated feature film perhaps in the vane of don bluth's artwork would suit a better mrs murphy film overall i give this a 2 because at least disney made a film from an under appreciated book series but i wish they did better either way i still have my books to entertain me
<START> disney has yet to meet a movie it couldn't make at least two sequels about and this one was no exception to the people at disney to give a weak story to receive a quick reward somehow although i did not pay to view it i feel cheapened by watching it br br ariel is grown up now and had a daughter yet doesn't allow the daughter to go into the sea because of some idle threat made by the sister of the deceased sea witch so here we go again br br the daughter is tricked of course and helps the sea witch after a not so glorious battle she is defeated and the mermaids and humans live in harmony yawn br br there is nothing to view here go back to your lives d
<START> i've never laughed and giggled so much in my life the first half kept me in stitches the last half made me come completely unglued i think i giggled for 15 minutes after the tape was over br br his timing and delivery for his stories is almost unequaled and though he talks fast you catch every joke which is probably why my laugh center was so overwhelmed it took an extra 15 minutes to laugh at everything br br
<START> anyone who's watched a few lifetime movie network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that gets brushed off the planning table so when crazed lara moves into patti's home and methodically begins to drive her landlady bonkers i didn't even blink when lara eventually ramps up her activities to threatening poor patti and dares her to do anything about it i just nodded you see on planet lmn people don't behave the way they do for any particular reason they just do it to keep the action going only on planet lmn could someone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house by means of their seductive powers poor patti she just trusted too much and lara went off her medicine and then there was this big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe full of deadly stuff that ends up injected into someone's tummy and a body bag going out the front door the horror br br but take it from me this planet lmn product is a classic you need to watch it once just for the great laughs you'll have on the improbability scale i give this film a 95 100 make a big batch of popcorn and get some apple slices too you'll understand later
<START> this movie is pure guano mom always said if you can't say anything nice but even mom would say i had to do my part to warn others of this movie br br i can guarantee this is the film that geoffrey rush wishes would just go away i would hope that greg kinnear fired his agent from a cannon for giving him the script after this ben stiller is probably praying for someone to pitch there's still something about mary i have always been a fan of wes studi's thank whatever you hold holy that he wore a mask through the film so maybe people won't identify the film with him br br it starts of promisingly with a stylistic spoof of the cinematography of the batman films and then just loses something like a coherent plot and half decent effects br br the jokes are telegraphed an hour before the punchline comes and even then they fall flat if you want to see an effective spoof of the comic book world see chasing amy br br run don't walk away from mystery men
<START> thomas archer ron eldard has his child killed and his wife viciously attacked in a home invasion dr heller christopher plummer tries to help him through the post traumatic stress then archer finds himself confronted with a man til schweiger bound and gagged to a chair he is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes to him and there's a large assortment of instruments there to help him br br film is interesting at first and shows real restraint in terms of blood and gore but gets stupider by the minute and has some highly unlikely plot twists and turns it all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that i was shocked anyone would actually think of using it anymore how such talented actors like eldard schweiger and plummer got involved in crap like this is beyond me this gets three stars for the acting but the stupid plot and truly unbelievable twists make this a chore to sit through
<START> this is a film about 17th century italian artists and one artist in particular a woman artemisia an unheard of profession for females at that time and she dared to paint the male nude detailing his unique musculature br br the camera work is principally indoors for that is where the artists mainly worked there are some great shots close ups by candle light suggest the beautiful work of the classical painters and it is fascinating to watch the painters and their students supported by elaborate scaffolding brushing in details of religious frescoes it is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film costumes faces make up are quite superbly authentic because the italian churches have preserved all these details in their frescoes for centuries the beautiful artemisia is urged by her father to study under the great florentine artist tassi who has become expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting something very new but the unsuspecting artemisia is introduced to more than new techniques in painting after posing for her tassi violently rapes her her father is outraged court proceedings follow br br this romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending the outstanding feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail scenes such as women running across a field with the wind billowing their voluminous clothing add wonderful effects br br artemisia says she paints to please herself her father paints to please others as for this film it will please most i think
<START> after we counted the use of the f word oh about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together well we turned it off relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser hollywood movie the product of unimaginative and no talent writers br br we did give it a second chance thinking surely it would get better no dice later my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved still no dice br br the main character did have a cool bike br br i wouldn't recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescents or frat boys
<START> final score an average of various classic cinematic qualities acting visuals creativity payoff humor fun ect br br 4 3 out of 10 br br had atlantis the lost empire come out a few years ago it would have seemed like a bold serious new direction in disney animation however it comes just a year after the innovative and nearly genius the emperor's new groove and marks a step back in freeing disney from it's repetative disney formula i'm a big fan of the feature length disney animated films have to see them all love it or hate it atlantis is an animated throwback to 20 000 leagues under the sea and similar live action sci fi adventures of the 50s and 60s problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea it feels like a remake of something even more so than actual disney remakes tarzan the hunchback of notre dame the characters are little more than a walking cliches of the usual suspects that typically populate these type of films the oddball mechanic the gung ho general the sassy tough women beyond milo thatch fox and rourke garner the supporting cast is flat out obnoxious the movie also suffers from it's succinct pace instead of fleshing it out into an epic story disney jams a lot in the usually brief running time brushing over opportunities to develop suspence characters anything really they thow us into this new and wonderous world and barely let us get our barings the awkward pace sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story the animation is dark and dreary and cheap this thing looks like a slapped together saturday morning cartoon let's hope they haven't forgotten that 2d traditional animation can still be wonderous the iron giant among others proved that br br negatives the visuals pace and sheer lack of originality br br positives quite possibly the coolest death scene for a disney villain in a long time it's the creative highlight of the movie
<START> to watch this film from start to finish without bursting into laughter at some point requires almost an act of faith as one has to keep saying to oneself it's old it's a classic be kind not because the movie is so bad but because at its best it's so good this is one dated movie it's also a classic if a tarnished one i'm not inclined to laugh at people anyway on principle and i get more than a little irritated when others do so to make fun of the informer to my mind is a little like giggling at an idiot savant when he dribbles his orange juice all over the tablecloth yes one says to oneself he is an idiot and yet when he's on top of his game he is also a true savant the same is true for the informer which is on occasion very dreadful indeed and yet it boasts splendid photography some fine acting a wonderful score and a good decent simple story in the end which i won't give away politics religion and psychology come together in a church in such a way as to make the scene seem corny and over the top and yet so is life sometimes uneducated people of simple faith behave differently from us presumably brilliant modern folks and the scene isn't so much unbelievable i buy it but i know the irish as embarrassing yet people do behave that way they do say things like that not everyone is hip and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be hip are people today so much superior to those of seventy or eighty years ago and in what way i don't think so we're just different now go watch the movie
<START> beautifully made with a wonderful performance from gretchen moll capturing such a stainless plain happiness in her work and the recreations of the little movies and the photographs are perfectly made and often hilarious according to harron they used film stock that is no longer produced and fifties style studio lighting even for the outside locations to give the colour portions its distinctive look bettie page saw the movie at hugh heffner's house she is now eighty three with the producers there but not the director in case it got awkward if she didn't like it she apparently did like it up until the official inquiry which she found unsettling some great costumes too the idea for the movie started in 1993 but this was worth the wait the portrait of her never seems to ring false in reference to all those images and snippets of dreadful movies that many of us will have already seen it would make an interesting companion piece with goodnight and goodluck but much more pleasant viewing
<START> in this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events gabriel robin williams a celebrated writer and late night talk show host becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother toni collette when troubling questions arise about this boy's story however gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secretÂ according to film's official synopsis br br you really should stop reading these comments and watch the film now br br the how did he lose his leg ending with ms collette planning her new life should be chopped off and sent to deleted scenes land it's overkill the true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious by the time mr williams returns to new york possibly her blindness could be in question but a revelation could have be made certain in either the highway or video tape scenes the film would benefit from a re editing how about a director's cut br br williams and bobby cannavale as jess don't seem initially believable as a couple a scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage otherwise the cast is exemplary williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization and not a gay impersonation sandra oh as anna joe morton as ashe and rory culkin pete logand are all perfect br br best of all collette's donna belongs in the creepy hall of fame ms oh is correct in saying collette might be you know like that guy from 'psycho' there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women due to a slighter dispersion of roles certainly they could have noticed collette with some award consideration she is that good and director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful br br finally writers stettner armistead maupin and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere br br the night listener 1 21 06 patrick stettner robin williams toni collette sandra oh rory culkin
<START> this film deserves another bad review consider one reviewer extolling the film's virtues that include 'no sex violence or gore ' uh excuse me the very set up of the film has us watching as cody's young comrade with love of life and who has everything to live for is blown to bits leaving cody holding his lifeless bloody body and given the nature of war we know that cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis so much for those viewing this film with such rose glasses that the violence which defines cody's persona is erased from viewer memory br br sans any family of his own cody like john rambo roams the country on his bike making the long trek to hometown usa in the guise of some place called nevada city no mention no realization of the clear fact that cody is damaged goods we know this since his co practically declares him so as he order cody to 'get some rest' away from the death and destruction of war this explains as none seem to notice or care cody's obvious 'flat' effect it is not bad acting it is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder not guessing here remember his co ordered him off the battle field br br how about that 'accidental' kiss as noted by another review the fall was an accident the kiss was not how exactly was cody 'respecting' faith by hitting on her knowing full well she was spoken for now that was a non family value moment a moment which is then announced to the immediate universe as if posted on youtube of course faith's lapse of fidelity as well as cody's 'coming on' to a woman who plans to marry another is received in the spirit of the xmas season all cheering their cheaten' hearts and lips br br we know little about faith's fiancÃ© except that she professes her love for him she takes no longer than a nano second to accept his proposal could have waited if any second thoughts he is generous he loves her to death the family has nothing really against him he believes marriage is based on compromises and the two have never discussed post marriage plans no evil doers here br br asner is a fine actor given over the hill dialogue like 'we love you son ' 'you are part of our family' literally days after they have met a stranger named cody and the 'band of brothers' speech where the phrase was above all never intended to apply to virtual strangers off the battle field br br bottom line this film is cotton candy xmas fluff that betrays itself in major ways most grossly when it applauds cody's disrespect for faith by physically hitting on her knowing full well she is spoken for by re defining family as we know it to wit accepting a virtual stranger as a full fledged loving member of the family because we all 'love you ' how many of you have done that or know anyone who has done that not
<START> a lot of people are saying that al pacino over acted but i mean common obviously for a movie role like this a cuban drug lord you need a bit of over acting in this role with that cuban accent this movie overall was a really good movie i myself rated a 10 10 i would highly recommend people to watch this movie
<START> this british pot boiler has one thing going for it the young men are uniformly good looking the older men are opinionated right wing thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the reagan thatcher years young or old however morals in this three part mini series are universally suspect and no one comes off particularly well br br nick is a handsome young gay man fresh out of oxford it is not pivotal to the story but he has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair which makes watching this drivel much easier nick comes to london with a friend whose father gerald is a rich conservative politician and babysits his sister cat while the family frolics in the south of france they neglect to inform him that when upset cat cuts herself with an assortment of knives and other kitchen implements nick mistakes their self serving 'gratitude' for affection and moves in finding out too late just how much they despise and patronize him inexplicably nick lives in this house for four years but as the plot depends on this point it's best not to question it br br while nick is most pleasing to look at he is unbearably obsequious his coy subjection to rich bigots soon had me climbing the walls deeply closeted except to cat she guesses his big secret on sight he does like a little anonymous sex just so we know he is actually gay though it hardly seems possible nick takes a lover who is even more closeted than he br br supercilious tories scorn and insult the two blacks in the film so imagine the venom which spews forth when nick's sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid gerald in true tory fashion has become involved in several personal and financial scandals so the revelations about nick add to his embarrassment this gives gerald one final opportunity to roundly castigate the hapless boy br br except for one brief moment of indignation nick takes the abuse heaped upon him in silence and tacit agreement denial self loathing naivetÃ© or ignorance you decide if you can manage to sit through this whole thing without throwing something at the set
