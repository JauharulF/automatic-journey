<START> no this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach fairy godmother and the glass slippers but if i were to elaborate i would have to spoil it for you which i won't but don't let curiosity get the better of you as this movie is not fantastic it's one of those movies that start off promisingly before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline and that's real horror br br yoon hee to ji won and hyun soo shin se kyeong are your ideal mother and daughter one's a successful plastic surgeon while the other your dutiful obedient and beautiful teenage daughter their relationship is like hand in glove so close you'd think of them more as siblings rather than parent child but things start to go wrong don't they always when hyun soo's friends whom yoon hee has operated on start to go berserk br br perhaps it's a warning to audiences and for those koreans ladies who don't bat an eyelid when going under the knife if news reports are to be believed the only truly scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery though somehow i thought kim ki duk's time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes on during the surgery itself br br it's a tale of two halves the fist being an attempt to shock audiences with standard scare tactics which i admit did get to me now and then however the second half degenerated the movie into mindless mumbo jumbo melodramatics and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat some things begin not to make sense and while attempts are always presented to explain you probably won't buy it not that horror movies are logical to begin with br br the leads are all beautiful and there is a distinct lack of male presence besides the negligible cop role but hey i'm not complaining though the storyline could have been improved tremendously i'd recommend you to watch this only if you're a fan of mediocre korean horror on vcd watch out for those face off ish moments
<START> i grew up watching and loving this cartoon every year i didn't think they would be able to take a half hour 20 min cartoon and make it a movie they did it with flying colours fabulous funny heart warming effective movie
<START> horrid br br the special effects make the tv version of tremors look real br br no one in the cast can act br br kind of like the '62 voyage to the bottom of the sea meets the cartoon ocean going electric eel cartoons
<START> as you can guess by my rating and my title of this review that i don't like johnny test now i think i know what people are going to say how do you know how bad it is have you ever watched it i did watch this show a couple times because i am studying film and animation and this just doesn't hold a candle to my standards br br i want to first talk about the animation because it is one of the most confusing things i have ever seen like the first two seasons or only first season had hand drawn animation i thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amount br br so that is one strike in my eyes but lets look at the story of the show it tries way too hard to be like dexter's lab but there are differences because instead of one red headed scientist there is two and they are both female there is a talking dog why and the parents attitudes are switched somewhat i have others but i don't think i can write them here i don't mean cursing but i mean i don't know if there is a limit for words everything else though is spot on even a deedee character johnny himself it just tries so hard to be dexter but it just seems to me like a heartless knockoff br br lastly i want to talk about the jokes remember in dexters lab some of the jokes involved yelling yes yelling can be good for a joke or two but dexter's lab also had sly remarks that made me have to go back and check to get the joke johnny test just forgets all that and just yells 50 of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears that isn't comedy thats stupid comedy i know what some people are thinking isn't three stooges stupid comedy watch that and johnny test back to back and you laugh more at the first option sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations which like chowder makes me mad i have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together to much bizarre doesn't equal comedy it makes you just think what am i watching br br so it strikes out on all accounts don't watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in anyway shape or form
<START> i saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show i still vividly remember the film especially the performance of robert taylor i always thought taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid almost dull leading man type and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks this film however proved what an interesting actor he could be he did not get enough roles like this during his long career this is his best performance he is totally believable in a truly villainous role from what i have read he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles he basically would just do what mgm gave him this film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles the other thing i remember about this film is how annoying lloyd nolan's character was nolan was a great actor but this character really aggravated me the last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years this film is definitely worth a look
<START> brief summary this movie demeans everyone it touches that means you br br first off let me say i'm not a purist and this might have been funny for a few minutes the impersonations are not bad but overall it's just dull and excruciatingly not funny a few simple jokes are repeated over and over again br br it's clear that this movies only exists to squeeze the last few dollars out of the now trademarked laurel and hardy the producers cannot have any real regard for their place in film history or their talents this is what offended me the most br br of course my daughter liked it so i'm also a failure as a parent
<START> the information contained in this movie is somewhat familiar to many who have been paying attention to the news lately the walter reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job taking care of our injured heroes when they return br br what this movie further shows is a truth common to all wars the psychological trauma that soldiers suffer while engaging in war and the difficulty they have when returning to civilian life they are not just changed or affected they are different people and most do not know how to deal with that as they do not know themselves br br finally this film shows what the military does to our young men in women in getting them ready for war and the policies and practices that they have to follow in prosecuting war that leads to all the psychological trauma br br we have over 3000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion but we have many tens of thousands that will suffer lifelong physical and psychological trauma because of this war it doesn't matter what side you are on it behooves you to know the cost of war to decide if we should be in that business this film illustrates the costs to the men and women perfectly
<START> i just saw a press screening of this film and i was pleasantly surprised not often is it that i get to see all of my favorite actors in one film at one time br br i really enjoyed the pick pocket scene and it was good to see rachael bilson and hayden back together i think their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together off camera my favorite scene was by far surprisingly so bret ratner's piece without giving too much away i'll just say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging br br the old couple were really good together and you actually got the impression that they had spent a lifetime together br br both the chris cooper and the ethan hawke segments packed a punch with surprises that seem realistic and similar to experiences that i've had in the big apple over all the film is a great place to take a date especially if you're already fond of the city itself br br i can't wait for the next in the cities of love
<START> weak scripts at times yep cheesy special effects at times yep deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time yep more about carl kolchak and darren mcgavin yep i always enjoyed science fiction as a kid but found so much of the dracula frankenstein mummy horror stuff as just so much crap it took abbott and costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters and it took carl kolchak to win me over to the dark side of entertainment the duke had rooster cogburn eastwood had dirty harry garner had maverick and rockford selleck had magnum and darren mcgavin had carl kolchak mixed in with all those weak scripts cheesy special effects that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars there was darren mcgavin as carl kolchak he had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual cover up by government officials additionally unlike 98 of us kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done even if it meant his demise the end of his journalistic career or jail time for all his faults including no taste in clothes carl kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow mustang which was an old used car at the time on his way to save the day for humanity as good as any other fictional hero carl kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to darren mcgavin now that he's passed on and his show is on dvd i hope he's having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing kolchak the night stalker all over again
<START> i'm not sure if the filmmakers were after a saw type movie or 12 angry men people piecing together the facts to get at the truth whatever it was it was poorly done and not worth watching br br i don't watch movies for blood and gore but because this film had little else going for it it should have shown the actual killing more most were off camera minimizing the horror that we were supposed to feel by the deaths br br it also bugged me that the cop was among the victims he unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man going to prison by accepting planted evidence given to him by mjh into the evidence room and wouldn't mjh a the prosecuting attorney have had access to that evidence taking it out and putting the wrong evidence back anyway so she wouldn't have needed the cop's help the others while often also not realizing it was this particular person they were harming still played larger roles in his ultimate demise the gun dealer should have know his guns would be used for evil intent the insurance guy rejected a person obviously in need etc but the cop's crime seemed minor in comparison since he didn't know exactly what he was doing the filmmakers could have taken it a step further and had him be the one that encouraged mjh to plant the evidence which would have made him more culpable and mjh's yelling that he the cop got her in that mess doesn't make any sense at all br br it would been more intriguing if each person died in a way that offered the others a clue to why he she was there and deserved to die the insurance guy for example could have had the applications he rejected rammed down his throat so he choked on them the oriental woman could have had her eyes gouged out because she was a false witness etc yes more violent that the gun deaths but more interesting br br the dialog wasn't witty there were no twists and the ending was one of the worse if not the worst i've ever seen the ending along knocked three stars off my rating br br the actors did a decent job especially given the garbage lines and motivation they had to work with br br overall a waste of time
<START> great movie and the family will love it if kids are bored one day just pop the tape in and you'll be so glad you did br br rube br br i luv raven s
<START> demonicus is a movie turned into a video game i just love the story and the things that goes on in the film it is a b film ofcourse but that doesn t bother one bit because its made just right and the music was rad horror and sword fight freaks buy this movie now
<START> the main aspect about the superstar's movies at his later stages were the frequency the lacuna between one movie and the next being a well established star of the south indian cinema the feedbacks he was receiving before baba was great br br since nattukku oru nallavan 1991 the number of movies he acted in tamil as a mass hero in 11 years were only 11 exactly at the rate of 1 per year all of these were a great hit he was having a image that many thought could not be easily brought down br br but after padayappa 1999 he went into a state of hibernation his fans all over the world especially in south india were ready to see movie of any kind with their superstar in action so the tamil cinema industry decided to come with baba br br the movie makers thought that the fans will take whatever they show with superstar in it but this clearly did not work out in this movie as usual the hype from the media and the expectation from the fans were way beyond limit br br rajinikanth's image was totally damaged the fans went nuts the movie's collection did not meet the expected level reputation of great people went down br br the only positive aspect about this movie was the songs by a r rehman rehman is known to have composed good music for some worst movies like tajmahal kadal virus alli arjuna paarthale paravasam star en swasa katre vandicholai chinnarasu etc well i never thought that this movie would join that league br br you'l feel very much depressed not because the movie was bad it'l be because of the superstar's image going down it took him five full years to regain it fully back with two movies chandramukhi and sivaji and give fans back what they really look for in a superstar film
<START> this is one of my favourite kung fu films and is regarded as one the most popular shaw brothers from the late 70's the plot is interesting and twisty the characters are cool each with their own style toad snake lizard etc the action is limited in comparison with other chang cheh venoms films but what is there is interesting with different kung fu styles on display from the various characters i recommend this film to those who think all shaw brothers especially chang cheh's films are the same most of his films usually focus on the 10 tigers and shaolin vs manchu conflicts this film is breath of fresh air in comparison
<START> it has taken me a while to watch this version as unfortunately i don't seem to be able to rent it in the video store only the other version but i fell in love with it i was always borderline with the other emma gwenneth and toni collette as they are not british naturally have to put on the accent and well to me it doesn't seem natural it seems put on sorry but don't think toni and gwenneth did a brilliant job there i could not warm to any of the characters but this version is more heart warming and more the type of person i imagined emma to be it is definitely the version i will come back to from now on i was disappointed that mr knightley was not better looking but he is convincing i also like jane fairfax better played by olivia williams i never warmed to her in the movie version but she is better portrayed in this version come to think of it besides mr knightley all characters are better played and a lot less over the top unfortunately both came out around same time and the paltrow version got more publicity pity i also love the new scene at the end well done to kate beckingsale therefore if you are a jane austen fan don't forget to watch this one
<START> oh dear jerry may be the undisputed king of talkshow but the movies are a whole different ball game and he's way out of his league the script for this film is so poor it has to be seen to be believed and its sad to see such vaguely familiar actors as michael dudikoff 80's action Âb'movie king michael jai white last seen in the sci fi flop Âspawn' as well as surviving the games' william macnamara who is involved in the only half funny situation in the whole film stoop this low for employment if you are a fan of jerry then stick to his tv show as this is a total waste of and hour and a half after i had finished sitting through this i managed to catch the last half an hour of rocky 5 on tv which looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison i think that says more than enough br br
<START> forbidden planet represents the kind of science fiction that is precious in cinema especially from the 1950s there was the day the earth stood still and war of the worlds but lest not forget this gem which took some of its story from shakespeare's the tempest to tell a tale of astronauts on a planet that has a doctor on it who has made a remarkable breakthrough it's the kind of breakthrough that is not so much incredible to look at though for 1956 it does look quite amazing to look at some of those sets and that gigantic machine the doctor creates but with its emphasis on the characters and its themes of technology taken too far by the more primitive side of human nature even when we don't know we're channeling it br br on the surface that is in the first ten minutes it looks standard if a little more professionally acted and directed with better skill than the b movies of the period a ship of astronauts are on a mission to the planet altair 4 to bring back an expedition that went missing decades before but the only one left is dr morbis walter pidgeon and his daughter who somehow were immune to an attack that left everyone else dead morbius appears to be a cordial and highly intelligent man and his technology looks to be so impressive that the only thing the astronauts led by the skipper leslie nielsen can think to do is to report it back to their superiors on earth br br but there's a catch something is killing off members of the crew of the ship one by one every night even when the others keep an eye out and then put up an invisible electric fence which the invisible something goes through easily meanwhile there's some romance possibly between the skipper and alraira and there's a more pushy vibe from the doctor you shouldn't have come to the planet to start and now you need to go what happens from this is even more fascinating just on a purely intellectual level but forbidden planet never forgets that its audience should also be entertained by this story while getting some useful ideas while everyone may remember robbie the robot and for good reason perhaps the most unforgettable image for me is the monster realized on screen with the crew firing to no avail animated with red electricity and looking so beastly that it looks out of fantasia br br the acting from pidgeon is subtle you wouldn't expect him to be a villain though something is there in the character and in the performance that speaks to this and by the end it makes the character far more complex than one would expect and the other performances are workmanlike but also excellent from nielsen as a born leader to holliman providing some great comic relief as the cook who i should add helps with one of the funniest scenes in the film with those gallons of bourbon robbie provides and the effects for its time are extraordinary sophisticated in a nostalgic pulp way for today too and the music done by electronics is beautiful in its tones but ultimately it's the screenplay and careful direction from hilcox that puts this a notch above the rest of the b movie lot when it's meant to be funny it's intentionally so and it works when it's dramatic it connects quite well even in its stiff moments with the actors and when we are made to think about a horrible situation it comes on gradually with nuance not shoved in our faces or injected with mega action br br an inspiration for many other sci fi films and a fine marker of thoughtful science fiction stories and books from time old it's a classy and entertaining classic
<START> true story of three girls who go into the wilds of connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods this is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across america thirty years ago to mixed acclaim not particularly much of anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results the film is watchable but isn't at all scary blame how some of the attack scenes for that its the sort of film that you'll probably forget about once you're done with it odds are that you're never going to think to see this unless its handed to you by someone and told here watch this which is what happened to me if you're handed a copy give it back the film isn't worth the effort to see it even if it is watchable
<START> whenever i see most reviews it's called 'a misfire for eddie murphy' these critics want to take a look at some of the stuff he's doing these days and maybe soften their stance in retrospect the golden child is not highbrow entertainment but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into old clichÃ©s and gives murphy one of his best roles i don't understand the pervading lack of 'love' for its efforts at all perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout thrill a minute adventures steven spielberg started it with indiana jones it's unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless there's nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends br br yes it's silly but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that 'ridiculous' is where hollywood's idea of mysticism begins and ends what's more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights michael ritchie and eddie murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine my advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride
<START> the movie is great and i like the story i prefer this movie than other movie such the cell sick movie and highlander silly movie i just tell the truth i like a reality hehe and also a true story br br
