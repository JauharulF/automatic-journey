<START> i've never been impressed by jd anyway and final justice which i hadn't seen prior to its mst3k airing proves to be no exception it's not that the character is any less likeable than mitchell it's just that there's less that geronimo call me 'heronimo' to dislike br br in fact one suspects that mitchell and final justice were all schemes of a revenge seeking agent of joe don's trying to get the star killed by inducing a heart attack br br joe don must have found a new agent since he's now graduated to comic relief in james bond movies the problem is it's hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters there and his serious characters in his action movies like this one br br as for the plot umm what plot they repeat the same set pieces so repeatedly you'll think you were watching groundhog's day 2 presumably the fact they keep using the same scene of geronimo getting out of jail is supposed to be comic relief of some sort ummm yeah whatever br br on the plus side the malta scenery is pretty gorgeous so that kicked it up to a 2 for me one suspects this flick set maltese tourism back a couple of decades though
<START> season after season the players or characters in this show appear to be people who you'd absolutely love to hate is this show rigged to be that or were they chosen for the same each episode vilifies one single person specifically and he ends up getting killed off you enjoy seeing them get screwed although its totally wrong and sick you enjoy seeing them screwing others getting screwed themselves playing dirty getting it back escaping and finally getting kicked out by trump the amount of tears also seems to be increasing by the season br br the rewards which attempt to compensate for past humiliation and suffering are also heavily reduced in the newer seasons its like you get to meet xyx who'll lecture you about uvw like who freaking cares the characters are so hateable collectively and individually that you wonder if they're paid actors the only sane one gets to win br br watch with caution and maintain a conscience those are your fellow human beings in the firing line
<START> plague replaces femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in new orleans by director elia kazan kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes br br a man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game it turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact city and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease a detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles br br streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community regardless of outcome you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the film's protagonist br br richard widmark as dr clint reed and paul douglas as detective warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers barbera bel geddis as reed's wife has some good moments with widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of restful more than comic relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the new orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer joe mcdonald zero mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic walter jack palance as the skeletal blackie black death is simply outstanding with riveting intensity palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well in addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity especially in the film's powerful final allegorical moments br br panic in the streets is probably kazan's best non brando film it's tension filled suspensefully well paced and edited it's ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with panic he succeeds with aplomb
<START> if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie if you are young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom liked it br br great camp
<START> my wife and i started to watch this movie with anticipation it looked warm and touching it started out well but soon became boring and frankly idiotic after a while it got so bad that we turned it off the movie was poorly acted and honesty we couldn't really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell they could put up with this woman you lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting wackos singing and cleaning i would have had her committed and of course like most movies and t v series made in hollywood we have to throw it a token gay character this movie was boring i was expecting more from diane keaton
<START> i was at first disgusted with director sun woo jang because i had felt that he cheated me jang had the potential to create a strong deeply emotional film about sex and its effects on people but instead chose to focus his strength on the pornography element more than the actual human element i couldn't see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which blended both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best Â yet this film remained in my mind for days after i viewed it what stayed with me wasn't the story it wasn't the characters nor was it the apparent pornographic nature of the film but the transition that jang demonstrated between y and j if you watch this film carefully you will see that both begin in an exploration phase of their relationship eager to jump into the unknown but not quite certain the next step as they continue to meet exploring new avenues of pleasure they continually jump between the aggressor and the aggressed jang initially explores the idea that j is the one that in control of the situation then hauntingly the reversal happens when j becomes obsessed with y it is a very small change and due to the graphic content of this film it can easily be missed but it is there it becomes apparently clear near the end when j cannot live with y as their meetings become less frequent and j attempts to become a part of normal society this was a huge and very exciting element to this film to see right before your eyes but alas it was the only element of this film worth viewing br br i will ignore those that speak of this film as nothing more than pornographic because there are human elements at the core of this film as underdeveloped as they are they are there it is a film about a facet of our lives that is very rarely explored in cinema or talked about in the papers what happens behind closed doors is never known Â or so we should believe while the act itself does becomes repetitive after a bit director jang tries to change it up a bit with some constantly changing scenery our characters are continually moving from hotel room to hotel room to best quench their thirst for each other's flesh this is fun at first but again jang's repetitive streak seems to make it feel boring than exciting this leads me to the biggest issue that i had with this film jang had a great story with gojitmal but where he failed outside of the obvious choice to focus directly on the pornographic side was that he took scenes repeated them time and again without changing in front of us to allow us to get to know the characters where was jang going with this movie did he want the sex to tell the stories or did he believe the characters would he failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about y and j that we could care less how they resolve themselves the ending seems almost random at best as jang attempts to create a final resolution for our two absolute unknowns of this film i have to give jang some credit for trying but not much he attempted to create some sub stories that would create the personal element that we were lacking but they just couldn't congeal well together y's brother and j's wife were those plot points but again due to him focusing so strongly on the sexual element these stronger sub stories became un rememberable and down right dull maybe it was just how i viewed this film but outside of the sexual scenes nothing else worked together we knew nothing about j and y and that is why gojitmal failed br br finally i would like to say that this film could have benefited from having a strong score or a daftly remote music genre element to it to bring us the viewers closer to the emotions being felt by j and y from what i can remember and i am trying to push this film far from my mind i don't remember any musical undertones gojitmal may have been a stronger film if jang either stylized it with music or done something to allude towards our character's beings while i understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have quenched a stronger desire for more technically this was a poor film obviously an independent film in nature it felt more like director jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature i didn't see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above i just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough this was no larry clark production this was sub par and definitely needed some further technical clicks to develop it stronger than the final release br br overall i think i could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that i did enjoy but i felt this film was rushed repetitive and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them the obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived our characters were uneventful our story was underdeveloped and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between y and j into something more symbolic than sex to me jang was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic Â and it failed miserably this was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make br br grade out of
<START> this film was a waste of time even rented on dvd if super speedy camera shots get any faster than this we might as well pay twenty bucks to get in the laundromat get popcorn and watch the dryer spin jet li is so much better than this one can only hope that he won't be making deals anytime soon to make another cliche ridden film like the one br br if there's one film you should avoid this is the one
<START> how could i best express my feelings about this movie hideous a headache lack of coherent writing plain stupidity try all of the above for this travesty and that just for the direction br br story well i guess there is a story two dumb blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course they are mistaken for a 'world renounced assassin' sarcasm and are 'hired' by two 'mobsters' one thinks taking him out means a date and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of and of course the turtle reserve for the farting turtle that they build with the casino winnings br br sounds likes all this could be funny guess again they try to make it funny but its not filming sequences aren't well done i've seen better filming in hong kong movies visuals are average for a late 80s film but the problem is that its a 2007 movie br br not worth my time to ever watch this again it still doesn't beat danny glover's out movie from the early 80s as the worst movie of all time but then again that film is in a class of its own f
<START> gregory peck's brilliant portrayal of douglas macarthur from the battle of corregidor in the philippines at the start of the pacific war largely through to his removal as un commander during the korean war offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities certainly the most controversial american general of the second world war and possibly ever macarthur is presented here as a man of massive contradictions he claims that soldiers above all yearn for peace yet he obviously glories in war he consistently denies any political ambitions yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the president of the united states he shows great respect for other cultures particularly in the philippines and japan and yet is completely out of touch with his own country all these things are held in balance throughout this movie and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man although one is left with no doubt that macarthur sincerely and passionately loved his country and especially the army he devoted his life to br br peck's performance was as i said brilliant to the point actually of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film which is perhaps appropriate given who he was portraying with the possible exception of ed flanders i though he offered a compelling look at harry truman and his attitude to macarthur sarcastic repeatedly referring to macarthur as his majesty angry frustrated and finally completely fed up with this general who simply won't respect his authority as president marj dusay was also intriguing as macarhur's wife jean devoted to her husband whom she herself referred to as general although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one i very much enjoyed this movie although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about macarthur's early life i have always chuckled at macarthur's reaction to eisenhower being elected president he'll make a fine president he was the best damn clerk i ever had which seems to sum up what macarthur thought the role of the president should be especially to his military commanders during wartime well worth watching 8 10
<START> jim carrey shines in this beautiful movie this is now one of my favorite movies i read all about the making and i thought it was incredible how the did it i can't wait till this comes out on dvd i saw this in theaters so many times i can't even count how times i've seen it
<START> probably new zealands worst movie ever made br br the jokes they are not funny used from other movies just plain corny the acting is bad even though there is a great cast br br the story is uninteresting boring has more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers pizza kind of like the acting has been do 1 000 times before br br i watched this when it came on tv but was so boring could only stand 30 minutes of it br br this movie sucks br br do not watch it br br watch paint dry instead
<START> this is the last time i rent a video without checking in at the imdb reviews the limey is directed by steven soderbergh who also wrote wrote the truly awful nightwatch with ewan macgregor and directed such trash as out of sight with the anti talented jennifer lopez terence stamp is a fine actor and it is a shame he involved himself in such a bad film there is frequent confusing editing that seems like it was a last minute decision in order to make up for the lack or story filming and just plain common sense this film does everything wrong what were they thinking
<START> i missed the beginning of this film which might account for why i disliked it so much on the other hand i've studied the fall of the roman republic for years so i know the story then again that might also be the reason why i disliked this film br br the film has more historical inaccuracies than extras though it's so inaccurate that i don't think they made an attempt for it to be correct in which case it can be forgiven the odd thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing like throwing in antonius' marriage to octavia and then pushing it aside two scenes later why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and octavia is never even seen and like calling antonius by his actual name marcus antonius in some scenes and by his strange english name mark antony in other scenes br br though historical inaccuracies aside the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it wasn't for the leading lady there isn't an ounce of dignity in her she's hysterical dramatical and completely lacking control of herself instead of being a clever and composed queen cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of pms 95 of that comes from the poor acting but 5 is also from poor script writing far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script sometimes you weren't watching antonius and cleopatra you were watching immature versions of dawson and joey from dawson's creek br br if you want to watch something about this period watch anything but this
<START> this movie is a should be classic it's not perfect certainly the pacing while perfect for the stage is in movie form slow as a tortoise with arthritic knees jean seberg is misdirected to be too sweet and too gentle she fully shows enough acting talent skill and craft to convincingly play the clever passionate and confident joan but unfortunately the director missed the point of the character george bernard shaw is my favorite playwright in no other play has his dialog been more sharp nor the lines more musical however processing this film requires that you look at it as a lawyer this movie is a case and the viewer is the judge that is how this picture is to be enjoyed 7 10
<START> who are these they the actors the filmmakers certainly couldn't be the audience this is among the most air puffed productions in existence it's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shootÂ too much fun nobody is getting any actual work done and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch br br ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled bogdanovich the scenes with the breezy ms stratten are sweet but have an embarrassing look guys i'm dating the prom queen feel to them ben gazzara sports his usual cat's got canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot which requires him to pursue audrey hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic in the meantime the budding couple's respective children nepotism alert bogdanovich's daughters spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents ms hepburn drawing on her dignity manages to rise above the proceedings but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself ostensibly everybody looks great but so what it's a movie and we can expect that much if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of vogue br br oh and it has to be mentioned that colleen camp thoroughly annoys even apart from her singing which while competent is wholly unconvincing the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack surely this is not what gershwin who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived had in mind his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight but at least they were long on charm they all laughed tries to coast on its good intentions but nobody least of all peter bogdanovich has the good sense to put on the brakes br br due in no small part to the tragic death of dorothy stratten this movie has a special place in the heart of mr bogdanovich he even bought it back from its producers then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular his rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of hollywood stories so there's no joy in criticizing the film there is real emotional investment in ms stratten's scenes but laughed is a faint echo of the last picture show paper moon or what's up doc following daisy miller and at long last love it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which p b has never emerged br br all in all though the movie is harmless only a waste of rental i want to watch people having a good time i'll go to the park on a sunny day for filmic expressions of joy and love i'll stick to ernest lubitsch and jaques demy
<START> hm while an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes point out atrocious acting primitive at best special effects all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years severed ranks among the worst i've ever seen i'm never sure who the protagonists are all i know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine as seen in the dance floor murder scene all in all i don't really like the movie because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion which i can't remember anyway
<START> i have 2 words for you sean bean he is the only worthwhile presence in this film but even so don't see this movie even though he is good as the main villain you don't want to waste your time br br i didn't care about the characters except the little boy and in fact i didn't really care if the star crossed lovers ended up together or died the movie did not make me care or believe that these people cared about each other at all i have read a lot of classic novels after seeing the movies and this movie made me not even want to read the book the story seems so boring but i may go ahead and read it to try to redeem the story in my head br br stay away from lorna doone the actress who played lorna was also in sense and sensibility and she was much better in that watch sharpe horatio hornblower a e has great movies of novels like pride and prejudice or miniseries like the forsyte saga check them out don't bother with lorna doone
<START> shallow grave begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in psycho i'm leaning toward rip off after that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better almost to the point of being original bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story but the film already surpasses many in the yankee comes down south to get killed by a bunch of rednecks genre because it is actually shot in the south br br a group of college girls head to ft lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road note to yankees stay on the highway when you go to florida sue ellen lisa stahl has to pee so she heads into the woods when she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff tony march strangle his mistress merry rozelle to death note to yankees do not wander off into the woods when in the south not because you might witness a murder but you may run across a marijuana plantation this is the point where the story not the movie actually comes close to being good br br while tony march will never have to practice his oscar speech his sheriff dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do tom law is likable as deputy scott and is as authentic a southern deputy as i've seen since walton goggins deputy steve naish in house of 1000 corpses br br a few scenes in the movie are worth the mention the girls stop at a bbq in south carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out sue ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her br br and in the strangest scene sheriff dean makes like he's about to rape patty carol cadby and tells her to take off her clothes dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he's about to do the preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his bible his sermon is about how jezebel is saved by the blood of jesus christ i feel sorry for this preacher's flock jezebel was in the old testament a few thousand years before christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in heaven
<START> everyone knows about this ''zero day'' event what i think this movie did that elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were they showed their life for about a year throughout the movie we get to like them to laugh with them even though we totally know what they're gonna do and that gives me the chills cause i felt guilty to be cheered by their comments and i just thought cal was a sweet guy even though i knew what was gonna happen you know even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 i thought this was funny but still i was horrified to see their heads blown off of course i was i got to like them they were wicked maybe but i felt like they were really normal guys that they didn't really realize it but i knew they were br br that's imo the main force of this movie it makes us realize that our friends or relatives or anyone can be planning something crazy and that we won't even notice it this movie as good as it was made me feel bad and that's why i can't go to sleep right now there's still this little feeling in my stomach butterflies
<START> darius goes west is the touching story of a brave teen coping with duchenne's muscular dystrophy and his personal quest to see the pacific ocean he receives help and encouragement from a group of young men who love and care for him while going on this quest br br the story has a natural drama and honest portrayal of the commitment of young people to help one of their own stricken with this incurable disease br br anyone who thinks young people are self centered and narcissistic will find this movie to turn that stereotype on its head it is the power of the young people and their engagement with darius' plight that is very compelling in this documentary
