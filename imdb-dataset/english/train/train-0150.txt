<START> spoilers spoilers are all teen slasher flicks suffering from a drought of originality it awfully seems so first of all this is a noble premise that could've been utilized well a rejected young nerd who grows up stalks and murders all the girls who tortured the hell out of him when he was in junior high can't say you had nothing to work with but this film goes through the same motions as all the other recent slashers everything from the score to the camera angles allow us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will strike we know the pattern by now these stupid slasher movies push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute let me ask you something who in their right mind is going to surprise a friend of theirs in a dark dreary morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while she's all alone and surrounded by corpses does that make any damn sense at all br br valentine is only occasionally innovative one good shot involves the butchering of denise richards' character she gets trapped inside a pool and the killer pokes at her with a chainsaw there's some good songs in the soundtrack including one cool track by orgy the music video is contained in the special features section on the dvd br br even the acting is mediocre at best the actors all sleep through their roles of course david boreanaz is often stoic even in his portrayal as the title character on angel denise richards is a fine actress though and she keeps a stoneface throughout the movie br br valentine is just like you'd expect pretentious implausible forgettable cheesy and without a good scare in sight don't even bother br br my score 4 out of 10
<START> boring stuff we got here his 5 minute shorts are better than this know why because there only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how ever long this is br br the plot is kinda eh the last half hour is alright the rest is boring and not funny i had my hopes up the trailer made it look funny but the pace of this movie is pretty slow and sadly not funny just plain boring klaymen running into each other and trying to make us laugh not working br br maybe next time knox br br maybe re cutting this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing but for now its just not good
<START> there is no reason to see this movie a good plot idea is handled very badly in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense the reason for the killings are not made clear the acting is awful nick stahl obviously needs a better director he was excellent in in the bedroom but here he is terrible amber benson from buffy has to change her character someday even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed even though the movie was 80 minutes which is too short for a good movie but too long for this one there are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters br br don't spend the time on this one
<START> this movie tries hard but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s tv series that i am sure people do remember with fondness although i am 17 i watched some of the series on youtube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun sadly this movie does little justice to the series br br the special effects are rather substandard and this wasn't helped by the flat camera work the script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour other films with under par scripting are home alone 4 cat in the hat thomas and the magic railroad and addams family reunion br br now i will say i liked the idea of the story but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early and i am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy and i was annoyed by the talking suit despite spirited voice work from wayne knight br br but the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of christopher lloyd jeff daniels and daryl hannah all very talented actors jeff daniels has pulled off some good performances before but he didn't seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing and elizabeth hurley's character sadly came across as useless daryl hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored and i liked the idea of her being the love interest but sadly you see very little of her not to mention the monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them likewise with wallace shawn as some kind of government operative christopher lloyd acquits himself better and as an actor i like lloyd a lot he was in two of my favourite films clue and who framed roger rabbit and i am fond of back to the future but he was given little to work with and had a tendency to overact quite wildly br br overall as much i wanted to like this movie i was left unimpressed instead of being fun it came across as pointless and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential with some talented actors and a good idea but wasted with poor execution 1 10 bethany cox
<START> i must admit that at the beginning i was sort of reticent about watching this movie i thought it was this stupid little romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie still i watched it and i was amazed before sunrise is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth we are sentenced to death or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity or that we humans can afford sometimes to live in fairy tales br br the ending was wonderfully chosen we do not know if they will meet again in six months at six o'clock in vienna's station in our optimism we sincerely hope so the actors acted in a very good manner so that i began to believe that i myself could live a love story just like this
<START> devin hamilton is probably better known as the new name in legendary full moon entertainment sadly his arrival to this independent studio happened in a time when budget and production values are at its lowest in years however in his short career hamilton has established himself as a creative director that manages to make inventive and original stories now this doesn't mean that his movies are good but at least they are different to the usual in the horror genre br br in his debut bleed hamilton presents us a creative twist on the slasher sub genre maddy debbie rochon is a young woman that finally gets the job of her dreams not only that but it seems that she has also found a boyfriend in shaun danny wolske it seems that life finally smiles for maddy after many sad events until on a party with shaun's friends they tell her that they created a club where members have to kill somebody to enter br br obviously they are joking but maddy wants desperately to fit in that she actually murders someone after that event someone starts to kill the rest of the members of the club one by one it is up to maddy to figure out what is going on as anybody could be the killer including her br br maddy is a very interesting character wonderfully played by the beautiful debbie rochon it is a very interesting twist on the genre to have the lead actress as part of the suspects the concept is so original and rochon's performance is so good that it is a real shame that hamilton didn't develop the whole story a little bit better the movie feels quite slow at times and overall the feeling is the one of a good idea wasted on a bad movie br br the rest of the cast is weird in the sense that all the female cast is very good while the male cast is painfully bad danny wolske is terribly wooden and his performance as a yuppie is quite stereotypical julie strain brinke stevens lloyd kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles also there is lots of nudity both male female and the cast is very good looking so it is really a plus br br the low budget hurts the film in the effects department as there are very few gory scenes and are not really graphic probably because they would look bad nevertheless considering the budget the film at least looks good br br hamilton's more recent effort the sexploitational venture delta delta die is a better crafted and overall funnier film while this one is not as bad as other better known films it still has a lot of flaws and may be interesting only for fans of debbie rochon or fans of independent no budget films 4 10
<START> it's 1982 two years after the iranian embassy siege which involved the dramatic sas rescue from the balconys and with a war with argentina over the falkland islands currently taking place what better film to make than a gung ho sas film that re creates the iranian hostage siege whilst using britains number one action hero of the day lewis collins throw in edward woodward and a few other well known actors and you've got a winner on your hands well maybe not the film itself doesn't make the situation serious enough whilst the acting is quite second rate it's like a movie long episode of the professionals but without the formula this film goes nowhere fast and is quite predictable maybe cubby brocoli watched this film and decided to ditch lewis collins as a touted james bond replacement for roger moore watch it if your a fan of lewis collins or sas stuff in general if not save your time
<START> if the very thought of arthur askey twists your guts don't worry you can still watch and love the ghost train like the equally marvellous back room boy it is a film that is simply too damn good to be sunk by a single performance even that of the lead actor personally i love askey perhaps it's because i go into his world rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into mine which is a mistake too many people make the ghost train is so intensely atmospheric that you couldn't conceivably watch it without being amazed at the deep dark world it transports you to it is immersive in a way that few cheap and cheerful flag wavers managed to be during the desperate early '40s and it's a film that i would imagine few people have ever watched just the once the cast are without exception extraordinarily good perhaps linden travers lays it on a bit thick but against the backdrop of a lonely railway station in wartime she could hardly play a nutter and not stand out the sad passing of the lovely carole lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible film and now it really is in the past but waiting patiently for us to press play
<START> i just finished watching this movie it wasn't ridiculously bad but i'm really disappointed with it i'm not really sure why someone would make a movie like this it was marginally entertaining but i feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making monday the writer was in charge tuesday the director wednesday the guy who gets the coffee etc it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies but only had the time and money to make one br br someone else commented that the acting was really good but i'd have to disagree then again if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming perhaps they're better actors than i give them credit for br br the back of the dvd gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery something along the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure it starts off like that but then out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone or what was that other show that wasn't as good a bad episode of the outer limits br br my main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out there's the evil guy with spiked white hair there's the love interest who when she first appears the wind actually blows through her hair seriously once you realize it's a christian movie the end is also pretty easy to spot br br the cinematography was poorly done especially in the opening scenes way to put your best foot forward it wasn't atrocious for most of the movie but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady praying arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie
<START> i just finished reading a book about dillinger this movie was horribly inaccurate it's like they got a list of names and just made everything up his robberies and getaways were well planned down to the second when the time was up they left whether they had all of the money or not they had notes of every road where to turn etc purvis never saw him at the restaurant he was told that dillinger paid for his meal after dillinger left purvis never even saw dillinger before the night dillinger was killed only photos of him the way his gang members died were fictitious dillinger never robbed a bank by himself like he did in this movie if i had never read the book maybe i could have enjoyed the movie the acting was a bit over the top in places the action was overdone as well on second thought i doubt if i would have enjoyed it much even if i hadn't read the book
<START> less self conscious and much less pretentious than guts of a beauty this kazuo komizu gore flick is worth a look at least once br br sleazy snapshotters escort wanna be actresses models to a remote house in the woods in order to sexually molest them unfortunately for the horny boys a long schlonged demon who lives in the woods has already targeted the girls for fun br br the thing even ends up having fun with the boys that's if you consider beheadings dismemberment and masturbation with severed limbs fun br br once again it all sounds better on paper than it looks and sounds on film br br just as komizu mangled living dead at tokyo bay with his ineptitude he also mangles this effort and is only saved by some audacious violence and some great white panty shots br br don't buy the hype though or you'll be sorely disappointed
<START> more wide eyed hysterical 50s hyper cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti social pathological behaviour danza and grayson will leave you begging for mercy br br it's a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead or in nursing homes i kinda thought about suing them for torture as this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor defenseless ear drums i felt instant strong pain envelop my entire being that damn muscular vibrato can shatter soviet tanks into tiny bits nevermind glass br br why didn't you switch the channel if you didn't like it you might ask angrily fair point fair point the answer is that i wanted to but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that i fell to the floor writhing in agony with my last ounces of energy i tried to reach the remote but couldn't br br a silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by niven who then proceeds to pigmalionize him lanza is in love with asymmetrical grayson but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up this may seem like a rather thin plot but this noisy movie is so chock full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all this movie is relentless forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with slayer's reign in blood as in a south park episode whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world it's all infantile as if they were all 6 year olds impersonating grown ups i can only envy people who find movies like this funny it must be great being easy to please what a world of wonder would open up to me if only i could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious gut busting comedy br br but let's examine this phenomenon the 50s musical my best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more day dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into utopia or heaven depending on whether you're church going or lenin's tomb going or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy inspired places ttono is more akin to a representation of hell but that's just me i don't seem to get musicals people talk there is a story but then all of a sudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened when you think about it musicals are stranger than any science fiction film br br worse yet ttono my favourite type of pizza btw is not just a 50s musical but one with opera squealing opera is proof that there is such a thing as over training a voice to the point where it becomes an ear piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure the clearest example of this travesty is when lanza and grayson unite their dark side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet i tried lowering the volume i lowered it from 18 to 14 then from 14 to 10 then 8 i ended up lowering it to a 1 which is usually so low that it's only heard by specially trained dogs and certain types of marsupials and yet i still could hear those two braying like donkeys br br take the scene in the small boat in the river danza starts off with one of his deafening brain killing tunes and then nothing no animals anywhere to be seen even the crocodiles who are mostly deaf have all but left if you look carefully you might even see the trees change colour from green to yellow in a matter of minutes no this was not a continuity error it was plain old torture of the flora and those trees were just matte paintings imagine how real trees would have reacted br br the reason glass breaks when a high c is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency but because glass is only human hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self explosion i can listen to the loudest least friendly death metal band for hours but give me just a minute of a soprano and i get a splitting headache
<START> first than anything i'm not going to praise iÃ±arritu's short film even i'm mexican and proud of his success in mainstream hollywood br br in another hand i see most of the reviews focuses on their favorite and not so short films but we are forgetting that there is a subtle bottom line that circles the whole compilation and maybe it will not be so pleasant for american people even if that was not the main purpose of the producers br br what i'm talking about is that most of the short films does not show the suffering that wasp people went through because the terrorist attack on september 11th but the suffering of the other people br br do you need proofs about what i'm saying look in the bosnia short film the message is you cry because of the people who died in the towers but we the others east europeans are crying long ago for the crimes committed against our women and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you br br even though the burkina fasso story is more in comedy there is a the same thought you are angry because osama bin laden punched you in an evil way but we the others africans should be more angry because our people is dying of hunger poverty and aids long time ago and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you br br look now at the sean penn short the fall of the twin towers makes happy to a lonely and alienated man so the message is that the power and the greed symbolized by the towers must fall for letting the people see the sun rise and the flowers blossom it is remarkable that this terrible bottom line has been proposed by an american there is so much irony in this short film that it is close to be subversive br br well the ken loach very know because his anti capitalism ideology is much more clearly and shameless in going straight to the point you are angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces but we the others latin americans suffered at a similar date something worst and nobody remembers our grief as the whole world has done to you br br it is like if the creative of this project wanted to say to americans you see now america you are not the only that have become victim of the world violence you are not alone in your pain and by the way we the others the non americans have been suffering a lot more than you from long time ago so we are in solidarity with you in your pain and by the way we are sorry because you have had some taste of your own medicine only the mexican and the french short films showed some compassion and sympathy for american people the others are like a slap on the face for the american state that is not equal to american people
<START> how come i've never seen or even heard about this junk movie before it's right up my alley with bloody teenkill laughable plotting and an irresistible 80's cheese atmosphere hanging around it for some reason nobody is really interested in the staff and students of an elite catholic university are butchered by an unknown psychopath freshly recruited teacher julie parker becomes involved when all the people she has contact with either turn up dead or behave strangely this movie is hilariously bad there's absolutely no logic or coherence and every character is equally meaningless to the others for example there's a girl killed and her body dumped in a container then and for no reason the story suddenly moves forward three weeks yet the murdered girl is never mentioned or even missed not even by her boyfriend the acting is pitiful and there isn't even a bit of nudity to enjoy the revelation of the killer is quite funny because the makers really seemed convinced that it was an original twist it's not guys splatter university is easily one of the worst horror turkeys ever
<START> inappropriate the pg rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the mpaa whale rider gets a pg 13 but this movie gets a pg please parents don't be fooled taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake there were numerous times i found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary br br but all that aside the cat in the hat is still a terrible movie the casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces the beautiful kelly preston and the always likeable or hateable in this case alec baldwin are both good in their roles even though preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this the kids are conditioned actors and it shows especially with dakota fanning fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen br br did i mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie mike myers is absolutely deplorable i didn't like him as the voice of shrek and i truly believe now that myers should not be allowed near the realm of children's films ever again his portrayal of the cat is a slightly toned down version of fat bastard and austin powers br br in the end the cat should not have come he should have stayed away but he came even if just for a day he ruined 82 minutes of my life 82 minutes of personal anger and strife br br the cat in the hat may be the worst kids movie ever
<START> curly sue is a 6 year old with an abundance of hair and a life as a drifter she and her father bill jim belushi try to survive on the streets by being small time con artists in chicago bill decides to jump in front of a car in a pricey parking garage while curly will scream about lawsuits and traction to the intended victim it happens to be a very upscale lawyer named grey kelly lynch who is appropriately appalled at what she has done not only do the scammers make some cash they get to spend the night at grey's plush apartment even then grey feels she owes them more so the three of them hang together for a spell grey only knows the lucrative law business and nothing about life who better to teach her than bill and curly those savvy experts on life's realities but all good things must come to an end and there is no life for a legal expert and a couple of con men or is there this is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected curly is certainly as entertaining as shirley temple but much edgier of course belushi gives a rare touching performance as the down on his luck con and lynch is luminous as the snooty but soft touch lawyer john hughes as writer and director shows us his magic touch once again as the script is lively and unpredictable just watch curly and bill take grey out for a night with no money and see the humorous results do you long for happy endings long promised and finally delivered with a few uncertain moments in between this is your made to order movie
<START> everyone in a while disney makes one of thoes movies that surprises everyone one that keeps you wondering until the very end in the tradition of pirates of the caribbean this movie is sure to turn into a ghost and kill and rape your village it's terrible if you want a mindless senseless predictable action movie go right ahead i believe that young kids might enjoy this as they like it when good always wins but me i like movies where it's a toss up who's going to win this movie never lets the bad guys have the upper hand by the end when th heroes are left in an inescapeable pit you just know that they can get out everything works out perfect for cage and his friends he never has to think over a riddle or clue for more than 10 seconds no matter how complex it is see this movie if you want to see some impressive set designs not if you want to see good acting or a good film go watch a superman movie it would be much shorter and the kids would like it more for instance the scene where cage is fleeing from armed gunmen and the bullets are all deflected by a the railing of a fire escape and i'm not talking about a fence or anything just one little pole this movie shows the decay of films and the film industry to cheap gags and dull unrealistic action which this movie provides in huge quantities
<START> this movie could be used in film classes in a how not to script a b movie course there are inherent constrictions in a b movie budgets are tight time is precious scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days and the actors are often green and inexperienced the one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you scarecrow's script seems to have been written in a drunken haze i could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie but i'll just mention one the gravedigger the character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie he seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie he is shown with his daughter who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie the gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count why give the gravedigger a daughter why give the daughter a boyfriend why introduce them so late in the movie why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline scarecrow doesn't seem to care br br the story of scarecrow goes something like this lester is a high school kid played by and actor who'd i'd peg to be in his early 30's who is picked on by the other kids he is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named judy his mom is a lush and the town whore one of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings by calling him a faggot for drawing birds instead of monsters and cowboys if you have a high school student still drawing cowboys i'd think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows and later kills lester in a cornfield under the titular scarecrow magically lester's soul goes into the scarecrow somehow this transference changes lester's soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast i know some reviews have called the scarecrow a kung fu scarecrow i disagree the scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie the scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him those who smoke pot in the corn field those who dig graves boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set br br the bonus feature on the dvd should be mentioned the director a frenchman does an impromptu version of rap music admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by and i'm paraphrasing life ez a bitch but et has a great ass br br number of beers i drank while watching this movie 5 did it help no number of beers needed to enjoy this movie whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level
<START> with various bogdanoviches and gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew they all laughed is very much a family affair if you add the fact that b gazzara and miss a hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration if this all smacks of smug in joke self gratification you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent i love n y paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late miss hepburn make no mistake this is her picture mr gazzara concedes it to her most self effacingly in all their scenes together the plot a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs is of minimal importance it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie mr bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors from targets onwards there is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment miss hepburn in particular benefits from this love extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors principally who the hell's in it recently remaindered in uk bookstores the soundtrack to they all laughed varies from louis armstrong's 1947 new york town hall concert to sinatra to country to latin as eclectic as the city it portrays mr b s golden boy image was sure to tarnish for such is the nature of the movie business but it is equally sure one day to be restored and when that day comes they all laughed will be recognised for the fine work that it is
<START> this has to be by far the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last 20 years when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldn't be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films and he was a pretty fair actor wrong no one should waste their time on this film i fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and i don't feel that i missed a thing
