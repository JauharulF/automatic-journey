<START> i didn't at all think of it this way but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title midnight cowboy was a gay porno at that point all i had known of it was the reference made to it in that seinfeld episode with jerry trying to get kramer to florida on that bus and kramer's all sick and with a nosebleed br br the movie was great and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies i can't even remember because they're all crap br br the plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy joe buck going to new york trying to be a hustler a male prostitute basically thinking it'll be easy pickings only to hit the brick wall hard when a woman ends up hustling him charging him for their sexual encounter br br then he meets enrico salvatore rizzo called ratso by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time you think of him as a scoundrel but a lovable one like han solo or lando calrissian and surprisingly he and joe become friends and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such rizzo reveals himself to actually be a sad pitiable man who's very sick and very depressed and self conscious hates being called ratso and wants to go to florida where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems resolved and he'll learn to be a cook and be famous there br br it's heartwarming watching joe do all that he does to get them both down to florida along with many hilarious moments like ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party and getting caught by the woman who says gee well you know it's free you don't have to steal it and he says well if it's free then i ain't stealin' it and that classic moment completely unscripted and unscheduled where hoffman almost gets hit by that taxi and screams hey i'm walkin' here i'm walkin' here and the acting is so believable you'd never believe joe buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor jon voight and ratso rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved dustin hoffman it's not the first time they've worked together in lead roles but the chemistry is so thick and intense br br then there's the sad part that i believe is quite an overstatement to call it depressing ratso rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie can barely walk barely eat coughs a lot is sick and reaches a head point on the bus on its way to florida he's hurting badly and only miles away from miami he finally dies on the bus the bus driver reassures everyone that nothing's wrong and continues on sad but not in the kind of way that'd make you go home and cry and mope around miserably as though you've just lost your dog of 13 years br br all in all great movie and the soundtrack pretty much consists just of everybody's talking' played all throughout the movie at appropriate times an odd move but a great one as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly go see it it's great go buy it
<START> i feel like i have some uber rare disease that no one has heard of and i have finally come across a support group on the net i finally found this title by asking for an answer on an experts site on the web i too saw this movie in my youth and was struck by the atmosphere and especially the ending i have never forgotten it and have never seen it since no one i know saw the film and i had almost given up on ever finding it's title alas even knowing the name i shall probably never see the film again as it is impossible to find commercially small steps br br g
<START> i love sharks and mutants and explosions theoretically with those parameters in mind hammerhead shark frenzy should have been the best movie ever br br it is not br br the monster looks like a villain from power rangers and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement this might be okay if the makers weren't quite as proud of its design as they seem to be that is to say for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action scifi horror flick that could benefit from some mystery the shark gets a lot of screen time granted it is usually shaky and erratic i guess you're supposed to assume that it's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out br br the camera goes to a person about to get eaten the camera goes to the shark the camera goes back to the person about to get eaten only now they are screaming and armless and so on br br the costuming is bad the acting is poor and the special effects are sub par but the writing is by far the worst things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten or so something can explode because let me tell you the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions more better mindset characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion they shoot helicopters there is a massive explosion barrels rocks trees whatever they all explode so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end br br speaking of which i don't care how crazy a person is i find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant half person half shark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea that is unless that person is the mad scientist in this movie br br the bad thing is the movie is so random and at times boring that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person's prolonged interest it might be a good one to mst3k with your friends but past that if you happen to catch this bad boy on do yourself a favor and change the channel
<START> another of many nearly forgotten movies cranked out by poverty row in the 1930's resurrected by the magic of dvd br br starring stock universal player lionel atwill often a supporting actor in numerous frankenstein movies as a pair of twins involved in a murder racket one kills the victims stockbrokers involved in a scam and asks witnesses for the exact time while the other is deaf and is proved innocent because he could not have spoken to witnesses br br of course where it falls apart is if it was a congenital deafness wouldn't they both be deaf oh well br br atwill does a pretty good job here faking being deaf and mute unfortunately no one else here can really act worth a darn
<START> a year or so ago i was watching the tv news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area since then i have paid particular attention to this movie called 'fido' as it finished production and began playing at festivals two weeks ago fido began playing in my local theater and just yesterday i read a newspaper article which stated fido is not attracting audiences in it's limited release with the exception of our local theater in fact here it is outdrawing all other shows at the paramount theater including 300 of course this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie make up and for any other locals who haven't seen fido yet but are considering it i can say there are many images on screen from the school to city park to the forbidden zone that you will recognize in fact they make the okanagan valley look beautiful that's right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie however fido itself is a very good movie yes despite its flaws it is better then most of the 20 other movies playing in my local market fido is best described as an episode of lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead this is a clever premise and the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the 1950's emphasize on conformity and playing up the cold war paranoia which led to mccarthyism furthermore it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which george romero first introduced in day of the dead br br k'sun ray plays a small town boy who's mother carrie ann moss longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block however his dad dylan baker is against the idea as he once had to kill his own 'zombie father' eventually the family does acquire a zombie named 'fido' played by billy connolly and adjusts to life with the undead billy connolly was inspired casting he is able to convey fido's confusion longing hatred and loyalty through only his eyes lumbering body and grunts connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones this is his best role since mrs brown br br fido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as shawn of the dead and zombie honeymoon being someone who appreciates bruce campbell and misty mundae movies more than eli roth and jigsaw ones i prefer humor over gore in my horror however i understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough 'undead carnage' in fido yet i am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humor br br the movie does break down in it's third act it's as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the 1950s they forgot about the story arc however given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen i rate fido 9 out of 10
<START> i went to see this movie with a bunch of friends one night i didn't really hear much about it so i wasn't expecting anything but after i saw it i really liked it nicolas cage and the rest of the cast were very good but i do have to say giovanni ribisi's acting performace did need a little perking up but such a small flaw it could be overrided br br gone in 60 seconds is about a retired car thief who must boost 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life the movie is in no way predictable so the ending should be a suprise think it's just another fast car driving movie well you are partially right there is much more to it everyone should take a look at this movie
<START> yes it's another great magical muppet's movie and i adore them all the characters the movies the tv show episodes it's the best comedy or musical tv show ever and all the artists behind it but here they did such a rare fatal mistake and i'm surely talking about the weird ending br br i think it's very dangerous to involve that much in american drama and end a love affair by marriage we as all the poor viewers feel so free or maybe happy for the absence of its annoyance peevishness and misery so we all enjoy these stories which gather 2 cute heroes as couple in love without the legitimate bond like mickey mouse and minnie superman and lois lane dick tracy and tess etc so with all of the previous couples and their likes i bet that you feel safe serenity and peace therefore when you look at what the makers of this movie had already done you'll be as mad as me br br they made the weak miserable creature kermit marry his daily nightmare the most vexatious female ever miss piggy this is a historical change by the measures of the american entertainment's industry and it was pretty normal to have a negative impact upon the audience whom just refused to bless or believe or being satisfied with that sudden marriage even the pathetic frog didn't have the time or the proper opportunity to think or to decide anything therefore no wonder at all when you know that this movie is the most failure one in their cinematic serious grossing only 25 millions vis Ã  vis 65 millions earned by the first one the muppet movie Â 1979 five years earlier br br simply in this movie they took manhattan and my rest too
<START> a pretty obvious thriller by numbers in which the only possible twist turns out to be a hiding to nothing i was watching principally for the english language performance by isabelle huppert it wasn't great but then it was a strange role i wouldn't be surprised if half her contribution turned out to have been left on the cutting room floor along with several last minute script re writes br br the acting is the least appealing thing about this film steve guttenburg looks like he's trying to flesh out his role with the charm that everyone's told him he has there's a sensationally stupid sequence in which it's suggested that his sexual prowess will be able to help treat ptsd it's an uninteresting performance elizabeth mcgovern is more of a draw with genuine charm and character but it's small consolation 3 10
<START> awful just awful my old room mate used to watch this junk and it drove me crazy the book is one of my favorites and its a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from dribble like this they changed so much it is hardly recognisable which baffles me since the book reads like a soap opera anyway providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment it's like one of those lifetime movies that say based on a true story but are completely fictional there is none of the emotion or depth of the book just mindless melodrama if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading i suggest you try another version
<START> not having seen the film in the original theater release i was happily surprised when the dvd arrived since this film did not have the wide distribution it merited br br denzel washington directorial debut and the finished product have nothing to envy other films about the same theme by more accomplished directors the film has a very professional look it shows that mr washington has learned a lot being on the other side of the camera he brings a different angle to this film br br one of the best things the film has is without a doubt the fine performance by derek luke he is an actor who with the right guidance will go far no doubt his take on the troubled young man at this point of his life in turmoil and suffering for a bad hand life up to now has dealt him is very true his antwone is a fine portrait of a man in pain who is basically very good and has so much to give but no one seems to see that side of his character br br at the worst time of his despair antwone is sent to dr davenport played by mr washington in a very sober if somehow subdued manner because of the angst within antwone he misses the opportunity of opening himself to this man who wants to help but because of the constrains placed on his office just have three sessions and then has to dismiss his patient br br things work out as antwone is able to convince the doctor to keep on working with him antwone's past is revealed in detail the abuse he suffers at the hands of mrs tate his foster mother is brutal to say the least the attempt at the hand of an older woman in the tate's household of a sexual molestation gives antwone a bitter taste that stays with him throughout his adult life as he has been scarred by the shame he carries with him br br antwone finds love at last with cheryl who is patient enough to make him see a different world by the love she and support she gives him br br the lead performances are very good indeed denzel washington's dr davenport has his own problems too he is not a happy camper either he can help antwone but he cannot help himself or his relationship with an adoring wife br br the talent in the film is incredible joy bryant makes a fine cheryl novella nelson who is a fine actress is superb as mrs tate the abusing foster mother br br the reunion of antwone with his unknown family is a bit too sugary and sentimental but of course if one is to believe that fisher finds happiness at last one has to accept that part of the film as well
<START> you know the people in the movie are in for it when king sized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky in fact the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller and only lawyer chamberlain has the answer but he's too much the european rationalist i gather to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreams br br darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from director writer peter weir already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in picnic at hanging rock 1975 here it's the arcane world of the australian aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites something strange is going on inside the aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason yuppie lawyer chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man's court but the more he looks into things the more mysterious things get and the more interested a strange old aboriginal man gets in him and then there're those scary dreams that come and go at odd times br br well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout one reason the movie works is the background normalcy of chamberlain's wife and little daughters audiences can readily identify with them and when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework the normalcy begins to buckle and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide chamberlain underplays throughout especially during the underground discovery tour where i think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does after all it's the picking up of the mask that holds the key i believe to the riddle yet his reaction doesn't really register the revelation br br of course the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now thirty years later in the film the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocus pocus but the subject itself remains a telling one one way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene a big white suv barrels past an aboriginal family leaving them in the historical dust the terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells yet it's also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave perhaps there's something about past and future to think about here br br anyway this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you
<START> i first saw this movie when it came out in 1994 and just watched it recently and it is still funny i don't know if you have to understand hiphop in the 90's but it helps if you do in the 90's when nwa and public enemy were at the top there were internal strife within the groups and members when their separated ways ice cube easy e etc also there were the wanna b's accessible rappers that start making the scene vanilla ice freedom williams from c c music factory etc this movie makes fun of all of that in a way that seems like it's an actually documentary kasi lemmons plays an interviewer that spends a year in the life of a fictitious rap group name n w h the members of the group are ice code rusty condieff director tasty taste larry b scott revenge of the nerds and tone def mark christopher lawrence they are an up and coming rap group whose politics makes them controversial whats good about this film is that it is so thourough in its portrayal of the hiphop industry of the 80s and they way it pokes fun at it but if you know 80's 90's rap you know how much of this stuff is true still on it's own without hip hop knowledge it is still a funny funny movie and for all of those who ask yes spinal tap came first but spinal tap is not the first spoof movie either this in my opinion is equally as funny and in some ways better than spinal tap as spinal tap is to heavy metal fear of a black planet is to rap and the songs are off the hook also the dvd is chalk full of extras to include music videos of nwh as a group and as solo artists brilliant performances by rusty condieff and larry b scott
<START> sorry someone has to say it this really is was a dull movie worthy perhaps but dull nonetheless i nearly cried with boredom when watching it the acting is pretty dire the story drawn out and predictable the score and camera work totally standard and unexciting it's one of those movies you are not allowed to hate becase it is about disabled people but hate it i suspect nearly everyone does it is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie i suppose they too are not allowed to be objective this was made to win awards which i remember it duly did but it was neither interesting nor entertaining i haven't seen the play so cannot compare
<START> this is only somewhat attractive for fans of bad movie entertainment it is more worthwhile for students of 1970's pop culture the fashions the furniture the attitudes and that great women's lib moment of the early 1970's when it was still fresh and novel for a self employed independent woman to exist br br superchick joyce jillson had a monetarily rewarding if stultifying career after all what is a flight attendant but a waitress at 30 000 feet that goes for the male ones too she slept around with multiple men could protect herself and others with karate and wasn't tied down to anything this is the kind of emancipated woman that scared the juices out of anti feminists those retrograde idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband br br the sexy stewardess was a potent archetype of the late 1960's to 1970's geez even on the partridge family i remember swinging bachelor ruben kincaid constantly hooking up with stewardesses and from that point of view this silly film is an important pop culture time capsule of the pre aids free love women's lib swinging seventies the plot is quite awful though and for those cavemen in the audience there are few bare breasts to look at
<START> at first i thought that it was just about eddie murphy talking to some stupid animals i was right some people called this movie eddie murphy's comeback who are these people jesus if this is the best he can come up with he can just stay away what was the story again i was so annoyed by all the lame jokes i forgot i should have walked out on this one
<START> his first movie after longtime friend john belushi's death aykroyd shows much fatigue trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for belushi br br instead doctor detroit gives us bookish professor aykroyd masquerading as a weird violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as mom that's bad enough but he also has classes to teach a school dinner to host four ladies of the evening to protect and a pimp's dinner or something like that to attend no wonder aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time why should the viewer be alone br br it was on this film that aykroyd met future wife donna dixon at least some good came out of this chaotic mess br br one and a half stars you want good aykroyd see the blues brothers you want bad see doctor detroit
<START> luchino visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries the great directors of italy of the 40s and 50s were men who understood the medium but it was luchino visconti a man of vision who dared to bring a film like to show what he was capable of doing he clearly shows his genius early on in his distinguished career with ossessione a film based on james cain's the postman always ring twice which was later made by hollywood but that version pales in comparison with what visconti achieved in the movie luchino visconti and his collaborators on the screen included an uncredited alberto moravia a man who knew about the effect of passion on human beings br br the film has been well preserved in the dvd format we watched recently the film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how visconti's vision translated the text into a movie that rings true in a plausible way something the american version lacked br br what comes across watching the movie is the intensity which the director got from his key players the magnificent clara calamai does an amazing job as giovanna the woman who has married an older man but when gino appears in her life all she wants to do is rid herself of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life giovanna is one of the best creations in ms calamai's achievements in the italian cinema the last sequence of the film shows ms calamai at her best in the ironic twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed br br equally excellent is massimo girotti one of the best actors of his generation who appears as gino the hunky man that awakens the obsessive passion in giovanna gino is the perfect man for giovanna something that mr girotti projects with such ease and sophistication not equaled before in the screen mr girotti makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy yet with another actor it might not have been so apparent juan delanda is seen as giuseppe the older man who fell in love with giovanna in fact his character rings truer than his counterpart in the american film where he is seen more as a buffoon br br the film is beautifully photographed by domenic scala and aldo tonti they gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way italian directors of the era favored the original musical score of giuseppe rosati is perfect visconti a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors also includes arias by bizet and verdi that fit well in the context of the movie br br ossessione is a film to treasure because we see a great luchino visconti at the top of his form
<START> some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen and i understand where they're coming from but i really have seen worse br br that being said the movies that i can recall ie the ones i haven't blocked out that were worse than this were so bad that they physically pained every sense that was involved with watching the movie the movies that are worse than war games 2 are the ones that make you want to gouge out your eyes or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulness br br war games the dead code isn't that bad but it comes pretty close yes i was a fan of the original but no i wasn't expecting miracles from this one let's face it the original wasn't really that great of a movie in the first place it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek appeal to it br br that's all i was hoping for something bad but that might have tugged at my geek strings was that too much to ask for is it really not possible to do better than the original war games even for a straight to video release well apparently that was too much to ask for stay away from this movie at first it's just bad like oh yeah this is bad but i'm kind of enjoying it maybe the end will be good like in the original and then it just gets worse and worse and by the end trust me you will wish you had not seen this movie
<START> denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie br br maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie giving away most of the story line in about the first 5 minutes that and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before br br so first it confuses you and then it puts you off the dramatization pushes beyond suspension of disbelieve br br of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers granted it does that so if you are looking for that knock yourself out
<START> let me start by saying that i understand that invasion of the star creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci fi films of the 50s i understand that none of it is to be taken seriously the problem i have is that none of it works a parody should be funny and this one just isn't not once during the entire runtime did i so much as crack a smile in general i am easily entertained but i couldn't find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in invasion of the star creatures br br i knew i was in trouble right from the beginning the two stars make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable a water hose they can't control that gets them both wet these two come off as bowery boys wannabes why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the bowery boys is beyond me after the less than illustrious beginning the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences dancing indians vegetable men decoder rings and other assorted unfunny bits it's all just a complete waste of time br br i bought this on the double feature dvd with invasion of the bee girls that movie is academy award winning stuff in comparison with invasion of the star creatures
