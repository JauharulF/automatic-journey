<START> i will start this off by saying i couldn't get all the way through it i picked it up on a rainy day from walmart like the rest of the reviewers on this site i figured there wasn't any way i would regret my purchase was i wrong or what seriously now who approved this project they need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity that's the only fitting punishment i can think of for releasing something this bad the shooting reminds me of the movies i used to make for class projects on a big old vhs cam the acting isnt much better i think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos yay who cares shecky moskowitz is unfunny and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser that's about as much of the plot as i understood br br overall it's the worst movie i've ever seen i own it on dvd and have given it to many co workers to watch each comes back and laughs and says wow i didnt think i'd ever say i shut off an adam sandler movie 15 minutes in br br my response is always well now you can br br
<START> i completely agree with jamrom4 this was the single most horrible movie i have ever seen holy crap it was terrible i was warned not to see it and foolishly i watched it anyway about 10 minutes into the painful experience i completely gave up on watching the atrocity but sat through until the end just to see if i could well i did and now i wish i had not it was disgusting nothing happened and the ending was all preachy no movie that bad has the right to survive i implore all of you to spare yourself the terror of fatty drives the bus if only i had heeded the same warning please save yourself from this movie i have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the movie and should all be wiped off the face of the planet
<START> howling ii 1985 was a complete 180 from the first film whilst the first film was campy and creepy the second one was sleazy and cheesy the production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious the brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis' the scene from the first film was badly re created a skinny plain looking woman accompanies bro' reb brown to the old country romania to uncover the mystery to her sister's murder transformation death christopher lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sage guide to the two sybil danning and her two biggest assets appear as stirba the head werewolf of the romania she also suffers from a bad case of morning face ewww br br bad movie there's nothing good about this stinker i'm surprise philippe mora directed this picture because he's usually a good film maker the film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it no not the content but the film stock itself to round the movie off you get a lousy punk performance from a damned wannabe babel maybe if they forked over a couple of extra bucks they could've got the real deal instead of an imitation br br best to avoid unless you're desperate or you lost the remote and you're too lazy to change the channel
<START> okay it seems like so far only the barman fans have commented on this film time for a counterpoint beware this writeup is long br br for those not in the knowing mostly the non belgians tom barman director of this film is the frontman of deus one of the better known rock bands of the late 90's here in belgium basically they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale then egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart with barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the deus monicker the way it always happens in such cases the post breakdown deus was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original they tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album the ideal crash in 1999 presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting they didn't quite make it however egos were still pretty big it seems big enough for barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies br br more often than not this sort of thing is a very big mistake and this film does not make the exception and barman clearly went for art on this one another very big mistake for one thing he's a musician not a movie director for another deus at it's best made fun and provoking music but never anything close to what i would consider art it shows br br so what's this movie about basically it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in antwerp as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting the characters are shallow the plot totally pointless and the film just doesn't have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings humor the whole film made me smile slightly about 3 times and actually managed to provoke a single 5 second laugh not quite loud mood the film just doesn't seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all mystery well minor spoiler the idea of the wind man inspiring the name of the film is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza not very and has been done a thousand times before anyone remember johny destiny one of tarantino's worst appearances on film to date end minor spoiler and well its artistic so don't expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous in other words except for the few smiles it bored me out of my shorts br br so what remains well the soundtrack is pretty good though it suffers from some of the same problems that other ost's have shown lately first it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the cd second it gives the impression that barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs which simply doesn't work in the end it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs and sadly it's barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as i'm concerned all in all it just stands to show that barman knows more about music than movies camera work is okay as well though not anything that would make you scream out with joy br br the only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight seeing factor since i originate from antwerp it was fun to play a kind of guess the location game i would hardly consider this as a quality though br br all in all another chance lost for flemmish film i keep on noticing that lately the best belgian movies have been coming from the french part of the country this is mostly because at least they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional the brothers daerden come to mind maybe the flemmish art house filmmakers should try that too
<START> had a bad day dog bit the mailman car wouldn't start people got on your nerves then refresh yourself with a delightful experience br br two women decide to pool their resources in answer to an ad for a month's rental of a villa in italy due to financial circumstances two other women join them two have humdrum marital lives one is an elderly woman who prefers to live in the past the fourth is a wealthy and beautiful woman wholly jaded by life br br as the spell of the villa permeates their spirits each grows in her own way and is uplifted in her outlook this also changes the people in their lives who have visited them as they leave you know the magic of the villa will remain with them and you will find your outlook altered for the better a delightfully uplifting movie
<START> wow i thought this might be insipid but it was even worse than i imagined sometimes i like to watch a good car crash movie those that are so bad that you can't look away because you want to see how bad they can possibly get this is really the only reason i could leave the television on morbid fascination it wasn't so much the acting which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast but the premise and the plot which never should have seen the light of day the script too is groan inducing as for cinematography did anyone else notice that they used a curtains drawing segue device like in an old 50's tv show but without irony at first i thought they must be kidding but the movie takes itself too seriously to have used this in a tongue in cheek manner don't even ask me about the score the only high point is the final song by morcheeba i guess they wanted to leave people with something for their 8 glad i saw it on tv just silly i wonder if this is why timothy hutton has had trouble finding much work recently i guess if you don't expect much and want to watch a mindless thriller it would be better than spending an evening clipping your toenails which is why it merits a 2
<START> i watched this film recently on dvd and i have to say i wasn't impressed i know it's taboo to knock independent films but this one felt devoid of entertainment br br the premise was interesting but the execution of it fell short i found myself thinking okay they're just getting into it the story will pick up soon before i knew it the film was over and the story never picked up i can't say i found the acting all that impressive either it was pretty bad not star wars prequel trilogy bad but bad nonetheless br br i'm not sure what the running time was i'll assume two hours because it's a safe estimate anyway when the film was finished i felt as though i deserved some kind of recognition for the will power i exerted in not stopping the film and walking away halfway through br br again i was thoroughly unimpressed and eventually bored out of my wits i'm not one of those guys who requires fast paced action and explosions in a film so don't start in on me as that being a reason for not liking it
<START> another example of the unique talents of cary grant a performance worthy of oscar consideration yet once again shunned by the academy mr grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city the pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis loosely for the more modern tom hanks vehicle the money pit br br if you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex this movie is a must see
<START> deodato brings us some mildly shocking moments and a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously absolutely a classic in it's own particular kind of way this movie provides a refreshingly different look at barbarians if you get a chance to see this movie do so you'll definitely have a smile on your face most of the time not because it's funny or anything mundane like that but because it's so bad it goes out the other way and becomes good though maybe not clean fun
<START> i went to see this movie with my 17 y o daughter i insisted we go the matinÃ©e showing not because i'm a tightwad but just feeling i had in the nascar spirit this is a sponser's dream so much blatant advertising it almost qualifies as an info mercial if it weren't for the so called acting keeping with tradition the herbie franchise continues with its cheesy story lines the car is only a 'vehicle' no pun intended for this cornball of a motion picture earlier herbie installments although cheesy as well were produced during more serious times making them a little easier to digest ms lohan disney's reigning drama queen has little acting ability i was surprised that mr keaton and mr dillon would get involved in such a project only the snack bar was a bigger ripoff
<START> a friend once told me that an art house independent film ran in a cinema when upon the closing of the film audiences were so enraged they preceded to tear up the cinema seats of course my imagination ran amok trying to conjure up the contents of such a piece of work well now my imagination can be put to rest br br i am a lifelong andrei tarkovky fan and an ardent admirer of his work i have come across many people who thought tarkovsky's films are slow moving and inert opinions being what they are i found this not to be true of the late director's wonderful works which are wrought with meaning beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions upon hearing aleksandr sokurov called the heir to tarkovsky i was excited to experience his films br br with the exception of the open air ride through the fields stalker this movie has no kinship to anything tarkovsky has done it does not seem to possess the slightest meaning even on a completely mindless level it's supposedly gorgeously stark cinematography is devoid of any compositional craft there is a no balance no proportion and the exposure meter seems to be running low on batteries in the freezing snow the main character is so inept and indecisive it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind sooner br br i am also not adverse to non plots or story lines that progress on multiple non linear fashion but there isn't even a non story here one must surely enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost as hair pulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a tarkosky time sculpture look as if jerry bruckheimer had filmed a charlie chaplin short br br i won't rule out that this may be one of sokurov's stinkers tarkovsky's solaris but to conclude that he is one of tarkovsky's heir based on this film would be to call paris hilton the successor to aristotle c'mon guys don't be afraid to say it no amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life i don't profess to fully understand russian culture and i probably don't have russian values but i immediately picked up on tarkovsky's work as something magical a treasure and a gift to viewers br br if it didn't have sokurov's name on it and it aired on say saturday night live i'm pretty sure nobody would read all these magnificent analysis into this wet noodle of a flick
<START> carol's journey is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons the acting of clara lago is simply amazing for someone so young and she is one of those special actors who can say say much with facial expressions director imanol urbibe presents a tight and controlled film with no break in continuity thereby propelling the plot at a steady pace with just enough suspense to keep one wondering what the nest scene will bring the screenplay of angel garcia roldan is story telling at its best which it seems if the major purpose for films after all the plot is unpredictable yet the events as they unravel are completely logical perhaps the best feature of this film if to tell a story of the spanish civil war as it affected the people it was a major event of the 20th century yet hardly any americans know of it in fact in 40 years of university teaching i averaged about one student a semester who had even heard of it much less any who could say anything comprehensive about it and the overwhelming number of students were merit scholars all of which speaks to the enormous amount of censorship in american education so in one way this film is a good way to begin a study of that event keeping in mind that when one thread is pulled a great deal of history is unraveled the appreciation of this film is therefore in direct relation to the amount of one's knowledge to view this film as another coming of age movie is the miss the movie completely the left elbow index considers seven aspects of film acting production sets character development plot dialogue film continuity and artistry on a scale for 10 for very good 5 for average and 1 for needs help carol's journey is above average on all counts excepting dialogue which is rated as average the lei average for this film is 9 3 raised to a 10 when equated to the imdb scale i highly recommend this film for all ages
<START> this movie is obviously low budget filmed in british columbia canada the obstacles that had to be overcome to make this movie convincing set in california late 60's 80's were well conceived i believe this is the best most accurate version of the zodiac killings that plagued the town of vallejo the bay area from 1968 19 he was never caught edward james olmos det dave toschi george dzundza zodiac at the time believed to be arthur leigh allen since cleared by dna fingerprints play a game of cat mouse re visiting crime scenes together each one trying to trigger the other into an emotional revelation olmos dying from some type of terminal disease knowing dzundza did it still totally obsessed to the point of losing his family becoming a full blown alcoholic along the way dzundza totally oblivious self absorbed like all serial killers to the carnage left in his wake the only disappointment was the over the top ending otherwise pretty accurate if you tire of the typical hollywood fluff or have an interest in the zodiac case check it out
<START> home room was a great movie if you've ever had drama in your life it keeps you wanting to see more wondering what the secret alicia is hiding i think i watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest plus i usually don't cry over movies but this one made me cry each time i wish i could find more movies like that one all in all i thought it was a great movie the more you watch of it the more you become part of it the very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma because it had her daughter's name on it my heart felt as if it had shattered just then and how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet i loved it so much
<START> i loved the first season the quality went down a little bit in the second season which however had a great middle pegasus third season was fairly novel and original and was ok fourth season started going downhill fast because they never even began giving us any explanations when by now we were really starting to need them what the hell was the cylon plan why were there two cylon factions what was the point of angel kara leading the fleet to a devastated earth 1 what kind of a past did the last five cylons have and how did they survive or were they reincarnations questions everywhere answers nowhere br br and then comes the end earth 2 our earth in the past well okay but destroying the fleet giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life and spreading a few thousand people paper thinly across the planet that's not only anti science it's anti reason and anti life and the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive a i that ruins everything it is without vision without hope for a grander future for humanity and it is antithetical to proper science fiction and don't even get me started on the angels religious claptrap of the worst kind the ultimate disappointment br br the whole all this has happened before and will happen again thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series not just to earth as we know it making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius frakkin shame br br 1 out of 10
<START> christ a sequel to one of the most cloying films of all time this at least has the decency to leave out the songs bar a reprise of the unbearable tomorrow but does continue the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny this time annie and her friends head off to london and get caught up in joan collins's plot to blow up buckingham palace or some such shite the movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is every time the little bugger squeals leapin' lizards i could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder drearily photographed slushy and plodding the movie has only one memorable line unhand me you stupid genius and the fact that it's not the original to recommend it
<START> when girlfight came out the reviews praised it but i didn't get around to seeing it i finally saw it when it got released on video and understand the glowing reviews br br the movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto we quickly get introduced to student diana guzman michelle rodriguez she has a bad ass expression on her face and any idea about diana that we might derive from this expression soon gets corroborated when she gets in a fight as diana gets in trouble for this we then meet her father an aggressive type in his own right clearly we can't totally blame diana for her attitude br br but then the movie really picks up as a new thought germinates in diana's mind boxing as a way to escape this grim existence her older brother has already gotten into boxing but her father most likely won't approve only diana herself can decide what to do br br just the first few minutes alone identified that i was in for a very gritty non hollywood movie but the brief appearance of john sayles in a supporting role truly affirmed that even before they get to any boxing scenes you feel like you're getting pounded in the face at seeing the ugly life that diana lives and when they finally arrive at the film's main story there's no turning back br br all in all i definitely recommend this movie i will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himself herself has been sort of a clichÃ© in cinema for many years rocky million dollar baby but i still think that they did a great job with it here in fact this may have brought the genre to its apex really good too bad that michelle rodriguez wasted herself in hollywood movies after this one
<START> this was shown as part of the 59th edinburgh international festival though for reasons best left to the powers that be a lot seems to have been made of the fact that it's the first thai language film made with thai actors crew but directed by a westerner needn't have bothered to be honest as this film is dull dull dull why hint at something why shroud an idea in mystery why subtly invoke a feeling when you can hammer the point home with terrible voice overs obvious shots and over the top scenes nothing is left to the imagination as time and time again director spurrier clumsily churns out endless clichÃ©s no hinting no guessing it's all up on screen no need to use our imaginations wonder when the 'scary' bit is coming no you wont 'cause the soundtrack will get more and more intimidating rising to a crescendo of ominously hell i'm making up words to describe how bad this is wonder whether the conjured demon is real or imaginary why tax yourself it's really is a snake and yes it's really is biting his crotch and there's blood splattering everywhere it's a strange uneasy film for several reasons it's supposed to be a horror film but it's not scary the jolts are signposted obvious it might be a scathing attack on the seedier side of thailand yet the director has a sleazy lubricious style when it comes to showing barely pubescent teens maybe it was casting himself as the virginity taking westerner that planted the seeds of doubt in my head or maybe the whole thing was just pants uninspired insipid repetitive hackneyed all candidates for best description but dull seems most appropriate and honest it's all been seen before probably better often with more thought rarely with less imagination or flare sorry thumbs down on every count truly dire
<START> wow this is a good movie the acting wasn't good at all but if you look at some moments in the film rewind and watch it again it is genius the man in the begin of the film walks with his suitcase against a three wow i never expected that then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away i bet that smoking guy against that three was one of his mates who sold the drugs later and the genius quotes ''nice shades i need a pair'' ''their yours if you think you can take them '' just brilliant and the fighting is the best i've seen in a while look at the second guy he takes down after he hit the head of the first guy against the table what a hit and in the middle of the film one guy in a car shot one time then 3 guys fall he is really good at aiming it costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him the end was brilliant it was so exciting that james cahill walks 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoot jason peters after his distraction moves jason peters falls down and roll over again while he is dead i can't say with more words how great this movie is
<START> my teacher taped this and showed it to us in child care to demonstrate how teen pregnancy affects people it just demonstrated how teen pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and couldn't tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such i wouldn't be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script stacy's the carrier of the baby mother is a riot she is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly unshaken when people spy on her through her dining room window bobby's the father best friend's name is dewey and is an obvious rip off of sean penn's character in fast times at ridgemont high this movie is horrid simply because none of the characters are believable thank goodness it's only made for tv limiting the public's chances of viewing it
