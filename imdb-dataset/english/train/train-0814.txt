<START> cinderella in my opinion greatest love story ever told i loved it as a kid and i love it now a wonderful disney masterpiece this is 1 of my favorite movies i love disney i could rave on and on about cinderella and disney all day but i wont i ll give you a brief outline of the story when a young girl's father dies she has to live with her evil step mother and her equally ugly and nasty step sisters drusilla and anastasia made to do remedial house chores all day poor cinderella has only the little mice who scurry around the house and her dog bruno as friends when one day a letter is sent to her house telling all available women to attend a royal ball cinderellas evil step mother and step sisters try to prevent her attendance cinderella finally gets her dream and wish and is able to attend her captive beauty genorisity and beautiful nature help her win her prince
<START> first week of may every year brings back the memories of the holocaust through movies on televisions among many movies they showed this was the one i had not seen br br the story is about hilter's life and how he came to power it starts with his childhood and ends with his holding the top most position of power in germany br br the movie was earlier presented as a tv series and later converted into a movie format scottish actor robert carlyle plays adolf hitler with great guts conviction and flare to give a real portrayal of this man br br it is a good screenplay and narrative that educates the audiences on the main events that lead hitler into power and also tries to show the probable psychological make up of hitler the movie is a biased viewpoint of the director christian duguay Â who shows hitler as a one track menacing angry and shouting person Â who had such a strong hold on the germans and people around him hitler is not shown as someone having charishma and attraction and there the movie fails to convince hitler's portrayal br br even though the venture was for tv all the ingredients of production are first class and at par with any main stream movie the production value sets costumes etc were perfect br br there is a lot of criticism of this movie in the authenticity about the historic events that is presented but still the movie is gripping every engaging and entertaining robert carlyle overpowers and dominates the screen as no one else does he is amazingly good Â brilliant i would have liked a more balanced view of hitler's life because i think hitler was able to bring out the dormant feelings of million of germans and it is not only him who should be blamed for the holocaust as i have told several times that Â very sadly our society loves to garland or prosecute one person as a representative of the society's good or evil respectively
<START> this remake of the 1962 orginal film'o the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors however scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch br br deniro is a superb actor dedicated to giving his all in the work he does however he needs direction to focus his talent and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film br br gregory peck's cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst robert michum is always fun to watch even with as few lines as this br br nick nolte turns in a better performance than lorenzo's oil but is not on the same form as weeds joe don baker has some great lines while juliette lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generation br br some good points the start credits the first view of cody's back when doing dips in the prison the scene where cody is attacked with baseball bats sam bowden's decent into full fledged panic cody's outwardly calm but unnerving prescence br br the worst the cleaning woman but not really part clinging bare handed to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed are there no speed bumps in the us the he's dead but not really parts and the aforementioned rambling ending br br i may watch the original again but i've yet to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since seeing it
<START> if you have any kind of heart and compassion for people this is a tough movie to watch at least in the second half of it br br it's in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a retarded mentally challenged man go off the deep end after he witnesses this brutal act against the child it's not pleasant material br br however it's a good movie and the acting is good too the story will sit with you awhile br br dominick is the mentally disabled guy and is played by tom hulce i think this might be hulce's best role ever he's looked after by a med student eugene played by ray liotta who became a star the following year with kevin costner's field of dreams br br dominick is a goodhearted garbage man who reads hulk comic books and loves wrestling he's the type of slow guy that you can't help but love and root for to live a happy life when he freaks out it's for several good reasons and well see the film for the whole story it's worth your time but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coaster and possibly be very upset at some things you see
<START> slow slow slow there is no mystery or excitement in this film if you don't figure out who the mole is in the first ten minutes you must be brain dead the secret service must have been too because it took them the whole film to put it together there are no compelling characters in the movie not film the pace of the movie is slow there is no tension the hired killer is an excellent shot unless he is aiming at michael douglas than all he seems to be able to hit is large panes of glass the funniest scene in the movie is when the presidents wife says the code word at the anticlimactic ending it is laugh out loud ridiculous at least six people got up and left the movie early i would have joined them if i were not sitting in the middle of the row i would not recommend this film to anyone
<START> this film has to be viewed in the right frame of mind first the central father son relationship makes it pretty clear that the film was intended as a prequel to his wong fei hung film drunken master ideas from this film recur in drunken master ii and not young master that chan backed away from this plan and renamed the characters indicates that he himself was not convinced the material was coming together properly and indeed the film conveys a sense of being incomplete for instance the romantic relationship around which half the plot turns is left utterly hanging at the end of the film young master from the same period also feels underdone but at least all its central threads are tied together at the end this film feels as though chan wrestled with the plot and characters trying to find his central theme only to abandon the effort possibly due to time and budget br br or perhaps the film is simply over ambitious this is an important turning point film in chan's career because he commits himself to development of the central character above all other concerns which is why there's such a lack of kung fu throughout the film chan wants to make an historical romantic comedy that just happens to have kung fu in it but both the historical element and the romantic element come across as little more than plot twists br br that leaves us with the comedy since chan's concern is character development the comedy is largely character driven as in the conflict between chan's character and his best friend an argument over a girl but there's plenty of slapstick as well frankly i find the comedy amusing enough to forgive the incompleteness of the plot br br this film represents an effort on chan's part to find a viable formula that he can use and develop over time it doesn't quite work and chan would only find that formula after abandoning the historical elements of his earlier films with the making of the contemporary action comedy police story but going back to view this film is still very informative as to how chan worked his way through the historical genre and perhaps why he abandoned it
<START> like most other reviewers i have first seen this movie on tv never on the big screen when i was a teenager my dad has always regarded this film highly and recommended it to me then and i must say he was not only right but this movie has stayed with me forever in the more than 2 decades since i saw it first time i have seen it two or three more times since then just a few days ago i gave it another watch and it has not lost anything of its impact with time it still a great and well worth to be seen movie manr regard peckinpah's ride the high country as one of the first and best later western which had a realistic look at life in the old west but the hardly known last hunt is definitely the better movie and was even half a dozen years earlier actually it was probably 3 decades ahead of its time or maybe it still is br br although thinking hard and having certainly seen 100s of western i like this genre i can not remember any western as bleak and depressive as this one two men bound together partly by hate partly by not seeming to have other choices surrounded by beautiful ms padget a crippled old man and a young inian leading the life of buffalo killers until fate reaches out for one of them br br nobody who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget its ending and the last frames of this gem when the camera moves on and away from mr taylor a white buffalo skin comes into sight on a tree and echos from the past when all the hatred began are present again mr taylor has got his buffalo but in the end the buffalo got him br br aside from the top performances of everybody involved the intelligent script and the great dialogue it should also be mentioned that the last hunt is superbly photograped i have seldomely seen a western that well shot aside from the ones directed by anthony mann which are also all superbly photographed that all the locations are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well br br and director brooks is really a superb storyteller master craftsmanship he has made quite a couple of really great movies and was successful in nearly every imaginable genre but even in an as prolific career as this one the last hunt still shines as one of his best if not his best br br definitely would deserve a higher rating compared to the 7 something ride the high country enjoys
<START> eddie murphy's delirious is completely and totally rude crude crass and lude this is indeed the only way to describe this appalling trashy piece of stand up eddie murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over he does manage to be funny occasionally but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex jokes br br forget it unless you happen to enjoy eddie's foul style i don't think i will bother with eddie murphy raw i much prefer eddie in the confines of a movie script br br saturday january 17 1998 video
<START> magicians is a wonderful ride from start to finish thanks in large part to the magic that is generated by the stars alan arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades like any really fine film it's a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming i can't believe this film is so difficult to find i'd buy it on dvd in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet
<START> ok i have read about this film somewhere in the internet and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was and i couldn't have been more agree about it then after that i saw this film on dvd i was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on tv luckily i spared my money for this pieces of crap i was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film couldn't make me satisfy so i can't be judging on how the film was made but anyway it still sucks as for those who liked this film i would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is i don't know what do you think about this film
<START> ag was an excellent presentation of drama suspense and thriller that is so rare to american tv sheriff lucas gave many a viewer the willies we rooted for caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of sheriff lucas we became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters the manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what lucas would do next were truly surprising this show lived up to the gothic moniker in ways american entertainment has so seldom attempted much less mastered the suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show this show puts shame to the current glut of reality shows which are so less than satisfying viewing the call for a dvd box set is well based this show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing a public that is tiring of over saturation of mind numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling bring on the dvd box set
<START> i was enjoying this movie most of the time but i kept getting the feeling that i was watching a children's movie i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then while filming decided to add in some blood nudity and language it was a big let down there's that believe the children magic that exists in movies like babe the pig or angels in the outfield that defeats the evil tooth fairy the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy when i bought this movie i thought it would be a b film response to the dreadful darkness falls somehow manage to make a better film with 1 4 of the money but they don't they made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost on darkness falls
<START> when it came out this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment to this day it's more entertaining than most in great part because it has james cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty girl friday played by joan blondell also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by busby berkeley are pretty much a knock out as far as that type of thing goes br br but this is a pretty strange movie i mean in one of those numbers you've got billy barty running around pretending to be a lovable toddler doing all kinds of weird stuff ruby keeler seems to have a sickening smile plastered on her face at all times but at least she's not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films you'd never guess that dick powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie apparently all the tough guy energy was allocated to the star cagney as for cagney his high speed rants about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time after a while it gets a bit too much you expect him to walk out and say hey i've got a great idea for a prologue the women are cigarettes and they come out of a pack of smokes oh no we did that one last month it's funny but it gets a bit repetitive in the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl ruth donnelly some of the established cagney gangster character comes out in fact frequent b gangster director william keighley is credited here with dialogue coaching and it seems at times that cagney and blondell are invoking something very street even though the characters aren't criminal br br the musical numbers what can you say they stand alone as entertainment the way that berkeley uses the human body and geometry is really startling but none of them really mean anything it means honeymoon hotel nothing really more or less and the whole pretense of the integration falls apart immediately since the characters in the show are doing things that couldn't possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays for example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper things like that the whole thing could only exist on film so the idea that the prologues are actually live shows is ridiculous i can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so because this is a very polished production br br it's great to see cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like keeler cagney and blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well the music i would say is only mediocre but mostly pleasing if repetitive bacon's direction in general is very suitable but never interesting the film's entertainment value is unquestionable and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way it's a cut above most let's put on a show films of the 30s
<START> anna christie 1931 br br on its own terms this version of garbo's anna christie shot a year later in german with a whole new cast is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the english version both are american mgm productions garbo is if anything more commanding or more beautiful as a screen presence and her acting is more restrained and she seems frankly more at ease probably for a lot of reasons but we can speculate that she was no longer making her first talking picture so had adjusted quickly br br without comparing always one film to the other this anna christie is still the same o'neill play with too many words his themes of a woman wanting love without losing her independence are here but it comes off as oddly old fashioned anyway there are some scenes missing the coney island section is shortened and isn't as good but overall it's a direct echo of the first film the director jacques feyder belgian french is simply redoing what was done already which i assume must be a frustrating experience br br it's interesting to see both films in succession because they are blocked out exactly the same way not only the sets but the shots are all the same there is an occasional scene lifted from the earlier film some of the storm understandably but also a brief scene where marie dressler from the english language version is walking with her friend on a plank over a canal drunk as can be but they are just silhouettes and when the next scene shows their faces we see the german actors taking their parts there is no replacing dressler for sure but for me the german father is more believable and honest in his performance br br clearly the themes immigration wayward fathers daughters turning to prostitution and the troubles of finding true love have strong currents back then especially with european threads garbo appropriately plays a swedish young woman
<START> ok i just have 3 words cheesy cheesy and cheesy the only redeeming feature of this movie is dean cain other than that it's cheeseball supreme br br the movie does have some promise in the concept an underground lab creates a real live fire breathing dragon basically giving us more of jurassic park meets reign of fire there are some great possibilities but they just don't follow through the special effects are decent even though you know the dragon is cgi it doesn't horribly look like cgi br br i wouldn't lay the blame on dean cain although he is one of the producers i'd lay more of the blame on phillip roth the director and writer it's his job to make this film and unfortunately he failed
<START> reed hadley makes a better foppish don diego than he does a dashing and daring zorro but that's almost beside the point because this serial features the bar none best theme song of any serial ever and the best version of yakima canutt's famous stagecoach stunt there are other good stunts and lots of action and plenty of hair raising cliff hanger chapter endings but if for no other reason you must see this film to watch the stagecoach stunt then re watch it in slow motion it is incredible and despite the lower budget for this chapter play yak turns in a better take on the stunt here than he did in the far more celebrated film stagecoach indiana jones eat your heart out this is the real deal
<START> justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside let's just take this movie as it's offered without extraneous explanations br br this movie is god awful straight up craptastic rather than rehash what may serve as a plot i'll run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head br br a class of 5 take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin' nowhere ireland these students may be canadian or american it's difficult to tell that it was filmed in a canadian forest rather than ireland is rather obvious as well one student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the dumb jock character from a number of kick ass 80's movie except when he channels randy from scream one character may be chris klein's stunt double he has a girlfriend who probably gets killed but it's never really established if that is true one character is sullen and removed from her peers just cuz and then there's a blonde girl yay blonde girl br br ireland has a population of 2 they're cousins gary who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast is called sir more than once he's very ominous and wears a knit cap his cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyond br br picturesque ireland features many canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks which appear more than once in cut scenes br br the producers got a discount on volume fake entrails good for them br br unbeknownst to me horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives perhaps there's some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register br br also unbeknownst to me if you inbreed for roughly 600 years as the story leads us to believe happened you end up being somewhat lumpy yet amazingly spry and fairly strong genetics are a wonderful game of craps br br there may or may not be more than one freak in this film reference is made to them and we see shadows yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever and when one odd looking dude is finally killed apparently all danger is passed i'm running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up thus they just used the one that's what it looks like on screen anyway br br richard grieco should be ashamed br br also of note aside from those shiny new knives the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear as once richard grieco cuts his bonds there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up who also then escapes because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone up br br a dead body in a shack will be maggot ridden after what i would guess is about 2 hours has passed said dead body will also have glasses on when no characters wore them curious br br jenna jameson appears for no reason from stage left chats for 2 minutes vanishes stage left in the middle of a giant forest that's not unusual as gary can also pop out of nowhere which is also known as whatever exists in tv land off the screen br br ms jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie wouldn't suck wind br br i offer a special nod to the breeder character the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months or maybe years for breeding purposes the poor girl who still has eye shadow on and emotes on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua br br the ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline drinking over the years br br apparently this wasn't just random crap i found on the movie network late at night apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through it's production how sad for you all i have nothing more to say may god have mercy on us all
<START> what i think i'll probably like best about the new star wars film phantom menace is that it will likely blow titanic out of the water if you'll pardon the pun when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts and thereby knock it out of the number one spot every time i hear someone declare titanic is the greatest film they've ever seen i think to myself you don't see a lot of movies do you what a travesty you could make 50 good films that are a lot better than titanic and for the same price tag br br well it won lots of academy awards lots of people really loved it as someone might say in its defence well lots of people like the spice girls and billions and billions of people eat at mcdonald's but that doesn't mean it's high quality yes millions of elvis fans can be wrong br br i'll be the first to admit that part of the problem for me was the mega hype over the film i waited a month or so to see it and ultimately it didn't live up to the expectations set upon it which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story it's true phantom menace will likely suffer a similar fate but br br james cameron's titanic is a a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece b a three hour epic that has it's finest moments given away in the trailer c a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment d something left better to documentarians which i would've enjoyed much more e a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship f a robbery of 3 hours that i will never get back therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine i can think of when i meet someone who hasn't seen it yet i say i wish i could trade places with you g a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia how long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences h thankfully a film that wasn't recognized for any acting achievements at the oscars i a technological achievement in filmmaking and little else br br the only reason i post this as a anonymous comment is i do not welcome the rebuttal of 10 000 thirteen year old leonardo dicaprio fans who'll no doubt come to his defense and i am not really interested in hearing a defense of titanic's story acting or length
<START> perhaps the best isabel allende's book house of the spirits describes an alternative chilean history this one full of magic a mystic veil plus some kind of omnipresent sadness this movie gathers a great cast plus a great art direction with a script that cannot contain all this book's quality it's unusual for a nearly unknown country like chile to get so well represented as it is by this movie whose perhaps only sin is to aim too high and because of that left the illiterate public a little upset mostly because they understood very little
<START> i love this movie like no other another time i will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated but for the moment let me quote a few of pieces the remarkable dialogue which please remember is all tongue in cheek aussies and poms will understand everyone else well br br title song lyric he can sink a beer he can pick a queer in his latest double breasted bondi gear br br another song lyric all pommies are bastards bastards or worse and england is the a e hole of the universe br br during a television interview on an arty program mr mackenzie what artists have impressed you most since you've been in england barry's response flamin' bull artists br br while chatting up a naive young pom girl mr mackenzie i suppose you have hordes of aboriginal servants back in australia barry's response abos i've never seen an abo in me life mum does most of the solid yacca ie hard work round our place br br this is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this bonser aussie flick if you can get a copy of it watch and enjoy
