<START> main theme in this dirty harry is that revenge is a dish best served cold sandra locke is as cold in this film as she is beautiful locke is an 8 normally but with a deadly pistol in her purse cocked for the bad guys she climbs all the way up the scale to a 10 having been gang raped along with her younger sister some years ago locke as jennifer spencer has tried to block out the attack from her life as best she can her sister tho is almost comatose as a result of the trauma so the memory is never far from her mind one day jennifer sees one of her attackers on the street in s f she buys a pistol follows him to a bar lets him pick her up then when they're alone in his cadillac beginning to make love she shoots him once in the genitals once in the brain this in the opening scene ya gotta love this spunky lady she's got her priorities straight plus jennifer is a professional artist putting all her anger on canvas until now after executing her first perp jennifer curiously watches det insp harry callahan process the fresh crime scene after the body is found in the caddy then she insults some creepy teenage bucks who are hassling women on the street visits her sister in a nursing home then goes a'hunting in san paolo ca up the coast where the rape event took place years ago with more bullets in her suitcase and more resolve in her mind our heroine relives the rape inside her head with vivid recall as she comes closer to executing each subsequent rapist not uncommon to us right wingers when it comes to sentencing or executing a violent criminal don't be sorrowful for his own wretched humanity we remember the crime and the suffering he inflicted such recalled events steels jennifer to pull the trigger on each of her attackers once in the genitals once in the brain throughout the movie scenes of jennifer's revenge are interspersed with good il' dirty harry blowing away some gangstas in a coffee shop remember go ahead make my day later on he threatens to step on a punk kid who'd just insulted callahan in a courthouse elevator like he'd step on dog s t leaving a young female govt employee staring after clint as if to say i want to have your baby my favorite scene is only about 30 minutes into the action when harry threatens and frightens a murderous mafia boss named threlkis into a fatal coronary during his granddaughter's wedding reception at the mark hopkins hotel michael grazzo pantangeli in godfather ii does a wonderful job as the sinful mafia don even if he's only in one scene dying in a most convincing manner however harry's troubles aren't over with yet the elevator punk's gang and threlkis' henchmen each attempt to assassinate harry in two close ordered scenes and most of them bad guys end up dying horribly yup some of the gun play comes off as uninspired screen violence looking like clint the director may have been tired that day of shooting this movie but there's only so many ways you can dispatch a man with bullets the punk kids die much more creatively though as they both burn to death and drown in s f bay warms my heart with so much violent intent directed at insp callahan his bosses send him to san paolo to try to get some background on the 22 caliber vasectomy killing as jennifer spencer's crime is now known but not before harry delivers one of his famous sermons to the chowder headed liberals love that harry while our hero' up annoying the local cops and citizens in san paolo two more murders happen same m o on a sleazy lazy fisherman and on an equally creepy hardware entrepreneur then harry meets jennifer they find they both agree on subjects such as law and order making the guilty pay etc could a hot love scene be in the offing soon we're led to believe just that characters abound in this real man meets real woman crime drama and we get to meet a brassy bull dyke named raye parkins who's both irritating and entertaining raye set up jennifer's rape for her boyfriend years before and she'll get hers eventually the san paolo police chief played by reliable eastwood co star pat hingle the hanging judge in 'hang em high' is strangely at odds with callahan's detective work related to the 22 cal vasectomies until we find out that his own adolescent son was one of the gang of rapists much like jennifer's sister chief janning's son is now a comatose adult but driven mad by guilt it can't end here though the dyke's rapist boyfriend mick now a kinky sex jerk of a criminal drives in from vegas becuz raye's dropped a dime on jennifer summoning him up to san paolo to prevent more executions mick sleeps at raye's house but his timing is all wrong and he's arrested before he can spend more time with raye mostly due to the fact that she's since been sent to the island of the eternal lesboes by a shot from jennifer's revolver psycho mick makes bail at long last with jennifer gunning for him a desperate chase ensues as harry tries to keep these two from killing each other it all turns out well in the end with the good gal and the good guy walking off into the sunset together to a beautiful roberta flack blues song
<START> well at least my theater group did lol so of course i remember watching grease since i was a little girl while it was never my favorite musical or story it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it's still a lot of fun to watch i heard horrible things about grease 2 and that's why i decided to never watch it but my boyfriend said that it really wasn't all that bad and my friend agreed so i decided to give it a shot but i called them up and just laughed first off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn't really clever not to mention they just used the same characters but with different names and actors tell me how did the pink ladies and t birds continue years on after the former gangs left not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy gee what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these t birds were just stupid and ridiculous br br another year at rydell and the music and dancing hasn't stopped but when a new student who is sandy's cousin comes into the scene he is love struck by a pink lady stephanie but she must stick to the code where only pink ladies must stick with the t birds so the new student decides to train as a t bird to win her heart so he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the t bird's butts but will he tell stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own well find out for yourself br br grease 2 is like a silly tv show of some sort that didn't work the gang didn't click as well as the first grease did not to mention frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable because i thought that she graduated from rydell but apparently she didn't the songs were not really that catchy i'm glad that michelle was able to bounce back so fast but that's probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel i wouldn't really recommend this film other than if you are curious but i warned you this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical br br 2 10
<START> mesmerizing breathtaking and horrifying this hauntingly beautiful film is the apocalypse now without fiction slow in pace quiet in mood it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom br br there is no doubt in my mind the nature is plagued and we are the disease greed the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress has turned us into something like cancer on its way to consume the host and die with it br br manufactured landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience at least i'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again
<START> a wonderful movie anyone growing up in an italian family will definitely see themselves in these characters a good family movie with sadness humor and very good acting from all you will enjoy this movie we need more like it
<START> when i heard the plot for this movie i simply had to see it i mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes sadly the title is about as funny as it gets br br led by detective dick mason a special team of military and scientists including greg colburn who never takes his scuba outfit off and lt finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind 'attack of the killer tomatoes' is a parody of b movies in particular japanese horror of the 1950's the film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady and let me tell you it doesn't get any saner as the film progresses to be fair there are a couple of funny moments for instance anytime the japanese scientist dr nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an american accent or when disguise expert sam smith infiltrates the tomatoes 'hey can somebody please pass the ketchup ' equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept unfortunately for 'attack of the killer tomatoes' spoof films such as the 'airplane' and 'naked gun' series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since br br the acting is atrocious there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy for a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once one gag after the over the singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre even for this film ultimately however you can see why this film is a cult one i can't see many people being indifferent to it unfortunately terrible would be the way i would sum this up
<START> i enjoyed this film it was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of peter o'donnell br br a number of people have disliked the film but it has to be seen in context of the origin story that it is the film uses flashback to show the young modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman that she became before the network before willie garvin br br the pace is a trifle slow and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes however this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version br br if you like modesty blaise you will enjoy it even with its faults if you just want an action flick with car chases forget it br br it has the feeling of being the first of a franchise but as i have never seen it promoted anywhere i suspect there will be no more to follow sadly
<START> all the talent mr sooraj barjatya showed in his first 3 movies i thought were all an accident because his 4th one main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad but i have to say it wasn't an accident this guy is talented and the way he has done vivah is just brilliant right from the first scene it affects you the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome the chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and kajol as usual alok nath as the good and loving father is fantastic so is anupam kher but its a shahid amrita film amrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong groom this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life all in all a brilliant film hats off to mr sooraj barjatya
<START> i almost didn't rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways i thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station they were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary the rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be the make up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one it was a simple story with believable acting it's not the scariest or goriest movie but i wasn't ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and i'm gonna check them out
<START> stewart is a wyoming cattleman who dreams to make enough money to buy a small ranch in utah ranchÂ his only real companion is his sidekick ben tatum the great walter brennanÂ to accomplish that they drive the cattle clear to alaska and on to dawson in canadian territory where they sell them br br along the way they meet the man who runs the gold crazy town behind a dishonest lawman john mcintire he attempts to steal them the herd later in dawson mcintire and his gang reappear this time interfering with stewart's gold claim br br captured by mann's camera in the wonderful scenery of the canadian rockies stewart is a thoughtful loner forced into violence by his need to get rid of the treacherous actions of a corrupt entrepreneur robbing local miners of their claimsÂ br br in this entertaining beautiful western stewart has two leading ladies to struggle with ruth roman a bit too valuable to describe as a sexy woman resisting the worst vicissitudes of the territory and the more docile the french canadian girl corinne calvet who does create a nice portrait of a likable girl with the ability to form a judgment in spontaneous manner stewart is lost between the ostentatious saloon owner and the wife candidate
<START> what great locations a visual challenge to all those who put their eye behind the lens this little jewel is an amazing account of what you can shoot in just 16 days good going folks i can not wait to see what your next feature will be i'll be with you all the way
<START> i can say without a shadow of a doubt that going overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen and yes i have seen cujo adam sandler is an abomination as schecky moskowitz a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner that's the plot br br that's it nothing else in the film makes sense it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way but more of a frustrating 'throw both shoes at the t v' kind of way even general noriega makes an appearance for no reason i can comprehend it certainly wasn't for humour add to the mix miss australia who has the worst australian accent i've ever heared and you have something which i won't call the worst film ever made because going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film i highly recomend seeing this film as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see i guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad film will be at least it wasn't as bad as going overboard
<START> i saw this movie on cable it was really funny from the stereotype police chief to the stereotype big bad guys jay leno and mr mayagi from karate kid star in this good comedy about a prototype car part i compare this movie to rush hour in which a local cop has to partner up with an asian police officer to solve a case the chase through farmers market in downtown detroit brings back memories enjoyable soundtrack good script i give it 10 10
<START> the film did what it set out to do show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity however for most of us this subject has been explored adequately and in most instances with more sophistication than done here the movie fixated on breasts which soon became boring and i lost interest if this was on tv i would've switched to the latest news on the starr report that's how boring i found this movie
<START> the scenes are fast paced the characters are great i love anne marie johnson's acting i really like the ending br br however i was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into achilles's and athena's relationship it only blossomed when they kissed each other
<START> i saw this movie last month at a free sneak preview and i walked out it was pretty horrible in the process of trying too hard they over acted and made a horrible movie i was disappointed since i felt all the actors had made respectable choices in the past so this one couldn't be that far off the mark but i was wrong i was hoping they would give out a survey at the end of the movie so i could tell them not to release this movie i was lured in by the free aspect of the preview but it turned out to be a waste of my time and usually i'm very easily amused it tried to be innovative and creative with the shots ideas and filming but because they threw together so many ideas at once it failed i'm not usually picky about movies and i usually don't feel the need to display my opinions about movies but i had to warn everyone not to watch it i registered on imdb just to tell all of you guys
<START> sure this one isn't really a blockbuster nor does it target such a position dieter is the first name of a quite popular german musician who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about it is based on the autobiography dieter bohlen wrote a few years ago but isn't meant to be accurate on that the movie is filled with some sexual offensive content at least for american standard which is either amusing not for the other actors of course or dumb it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a bohlen fan or not technically speaking there isn't much to criticize speaking of me i find this movie to be an ok movie
<START> after seeing all the jesse james quantrill jayhawkers etc films in the fifties it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director ang lee the scene of the attack of lawrence kansas is awesome the romantic relationship between jewel and toby mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and jonathan rhys meyers is outstanding as the bad guy all the time this film makes you feel the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours definitely worth seeing
<START> this film is famous for several qualities a literate script for once in partly religious film making by philip dunne some very good performances a first rate production in every department and its intelligent direction by veteran henry king if one were making a film then getting such talents as leon shamroy as cinematographer lyle wheeler as art director and alfred newman as composer of original music would guarantee a quality production add the cast of this film including gregory peck and susan hayward as the title characters james robertson justice raymond massey kieron moore jayne meadows and john sutton plus a dance by gwen verdon and expectations might be raised that the resulting film could be made into something special but in a biblical subject script usually a sub genre prone to illogical motivations and miraculous interventions everything would ultimately depend on the author's skills philip dunne here has supplied human beings a rare achievement in biblical films david is a man in this film many sided not someone doing mythical deeds on paper in the old testament gregory peck makes him curious passionate self controlled self deprecating and appealing as bathsheba hayward is scarcely the perfect choice but conveys a good deal of common sense earthiness and emotional normalcy that helps one see why the king of israel would risk so much for her the rest of the cast is stalwart and capable by turns the familiar storyline provides them little to work with but author dunne and the cast do as much as is possible with the human situations david's youth is told in flashback how he was chosen by a prophet of yahweh to be king of israel and earns his way to be second to the king saul by defeating goliath the phiiistine in battle when all else are afraid to beard the giant warrior thereafter he finally is driven from the court of king saul of israel becomes a famous warrior and returns to claim the kingdom and become the instrument of death of jonathan the king's son formerly a friend his wars are successful the film opens in fact with a successful attack scene but his life is empty since his wife michal jayne meadows is saul's daughter and is cold to him he turns to bathsheba whom he sees from the palace roof bathing naked later she admits she had hoped he would see her but she has a husband uriah when she becomes pregnant it becomes necessary for uriah to come in from the battlefield and spend time at home he instead asks david to set him in the forefront of the battle even after being aroused by verdon's dance david agrees he is killed a war hero but this does not solve the infidelity question drought comes to israel and the king's infidelity is blamed for the phenomenon at last david places his hands on the ark of the covenant recently brought to jerusalem and housed in a temple which has caused the death of others who accidentally came in contact with it inviting his god to punish him and nothing happens david exits the temple and finds that rain has come to his parched land this film is always interesting varied in its types of scenes and physically beautiful the director and author make use of the observer principle and are frankly more successful in humanizing the characters than in almost any film outside the grecianized near eastern canon wherein the feat is a bit easier since neither miraculous nor religious themes are made central in such adventures well remembered for its glowing realization fine performances and intelligent dialogue this dramatic effort bears repeated study
<START> fungicide is quite possibly the most incompetent embarrassing pitiful film i have ever seen the acting is criminal the direction practically non existent and the special effects presumably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenceless laptop computer br br far be it from me to stifle creativity but i actually believe things like this shouldn't be made i am sure the film makers will say that yes the film was hampered by a low as in nothing budget but in that case they just really shouldn't have bothered as it is they have offered the world something so dire so execrable that only imbeciles could get the merest shade of enjoyment from it br br starting the movie it wasn't as though i was expecting citizen kane or anything i was expecting a low budget little horror with perhaps a modicum of inventiveness a hint of fun and even some energy what i got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief br br the plot well our leering antihero scientist who works in his parents' basement is seen manically stirring some goo in a cup apparently such high level science is the end result of years of research his parents then send him off to a strange hotel type place in the countryside to relax there are some other people there who are simply too awful to write about anyway the scientist drops his test tube onto some mushrooms and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people wow i'm getting suicidal just writing the plot summary our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar by attaching a fuse really a piece of string to it the barrel unaccountably explodes with the power of a small nuclear weapon destroying all the mushrooms the end thank goodness br br that summary is as good as the film gets and actually makes it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is it really should never have got past this stage of development by which i mean a plot outline scribbled on the back of an envelope with crayons somebody should have really stepped in and given someone a vigorous shake and said no br br and those special effects well they're special all right this is cgi gone crazy and done by a person who i can only assume believes the bicycle pump to be the pinnacle of modern technology and when the mushroom monsters are not in the style of a 1984 home computer graphics package they are represented by actors shuffling along covered in a sheet i kid you not br br one of the most inexcusable things about the movie is its laziness this can be summed up by the scene in which the hero spins his guns a la clint eastwood and then fails miserably to get them in his pockets i mean come on a couple of retakes and he could have pulled it off but just to leave it as it is really weak br br i cannot believe money was spent on this camcorder shot rubbish the film makers should hang their heads in shame and be banned from going within fifty metres of any movie making equipment br br i also think it's wrong that friends and family of the makers come onto imdb and post mendacious reviews and give stupidly high user ratings which give a totally inaccurate picture of the movie fungicide is an absolute travesty of film making mr wascavage is either very very stupid or very very cynical
<START> for a film that's ostensibly about sex and leather it doesn't have any right to be as oddly sweet as it is the story of bettie page a good christian girl from the south who's momma wouldn't let her date until she married who moved to new york and ended up becoming the most successful pin up of her age is driven by an outstanding performance from gretchen moll her page can't quite reconcile the pictures that she takes nobody's allowed to touch it's all fun and respectful with the pornography trials and supposed ill effects that her images have on the world around her br br page has been an inspiration to every burlesque artist since not just because she had a figure to die for but because she invested every picture with an innocent sense of fun that was uniquely sexy and simple at the same time rather like this film in fact filmde in both black and white and glorious technicolour it's a lovely way to spend a couple of hours
