<START> this film is one of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best the scenario is based on the novel by vladimir nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant br br the photography of the film is excellent as is the acting of both turturro and watson turturro definitely gives his best performance to date proving he's worth much more than what we thought watson also performs brilliantly br br the story is about a phenomenal chess player turturro which is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life the film is presented in a non linear time with multiple flashbacks of luzhin's childhood through those the complex character of luzhin is described br br i have nothing more to say but to suggest this film to anyone
<START> the story of this film is truly remarkable a virus cut loose and only 1 of the human race survived the only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say the twelve monkeys did it thats right the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over 500 billion people apparently animals do not contract this disease day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this how it was created if nature did it or a mere human being had created it all they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them the deaths began during 1996 1997 and twelve monkeys have something to do with it or at least thats what the poster says so a current convict named james cole bruce willis is sent as a volunteer to get some samples from above after he does his volunteer work he is asked to be sent back in time to the year 1996 to figure out what happened to the world cole accepts and the story of the twelve monkeys begin br br throughout the story the time machine gets the dates wrong quite a few times from 1990 to some time during the 1950's in a middle of a war throughout the time traveling back and forth it starts to mess james up in the head and that twist the story up the whole story is very well done and i would of gave it a higher grade if it wasn't for the ending i personally didn't like the ending of the movie and i was very disappointed i just was expecting a more explaining ending then what had happen but it isn't everyone who thinks this way so i gave it a 8 but if everyone had the same opinion as me i would give it a 6 or 7 br br for the whole acting of the film i give it a a bruce willis is great for this role and he acts good but brad pitt is completely 100 excellent his acting is so great he gets into the character so well i never really cared for brad pitt in till i saw him in this and fight club there characters or similar in this film he is just a little more insane in this film so overall i think this film is completely worth checking out for most people it's a great science fiction film i just don't think it is a masterpiece
<START> the unflappable william powell he is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without a care in the world he always seems on top of his game and shows little care for anyone who doubts him the murders are projects barely human beings i have noticed this is a staple of the whodunnit other than an occasional weeping widow the victims fulfill the function of being the reason the movie exists nothing more there are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way and powell is a master at this there is a lot of political incorrectness especially as it relates to the asian performers this is a little hard to take the cast is great and curtiz's direction is also a consistent asset
<START> that's the sound of stan and ollie spinning in their graves br br i won't bother listing the fundamental flaws of this movie as they're so obvious they go without saying small things like this being the all new adventures of laurel and hardy despite the stars being dead for over thirty years when it was made little things like that br br a bad idea would be to have actors playing buffoons whom just happen to be called laurel and hardy as bad as that is it might have worked for a really bad idea try casting two actors to impersonate the duo okay they might claim to be nephews but the end result is the same br br bronson pinchot can be funny okay forget his wacky foreigner cousin larry schtick in perfect strangers and look at him in true romance here though he stinks it's probably not all his fault and like the director and the support cast all of who are better than the material he was probably just desperate for money there are those who claim americans find it difficult to master an effective english accent this cause is not helped here by pinchot what is stan welsh iranian pakistani only in stan's trademark yelp does he come close though as the yelp is overdone to the point of tedium that's nothing to write home about gailard sartain does slightly better as ollie though it's like saying what's worse stepping in dog dirt or a kick in the knackers br br remember the originals with their split second timing intuitive teamwork and innate loveability well that's absent altogether replaced with two stupid old men and jokes so mistimed you could park a bus through the gaps whereas the originals had plots that could be summed up in a couple of panels this one has some long winded mummy hokum and what a lousy title that's mixed in with the boys' fraternity scenario i can't claim to have seen every single one of laurel and hardy's 108 movies but i think it's a safe bet that even their nadir was leagues ahead of this br br maybe the major problem is that the originals were sort of playing themselves or at least using their own accents it at least felt natural and unforced as opposed to the contrived caricatures pinchot and sartain are given and since when did stan do malapropisms and so many at that i was gonna give you a standing cremation i would like to marinate my friend stop it br br only notable moment is a reference to bozo the clown the cartoon character who shared larry harmon's l h comic harmon of course bought the name copyright how disconcerting to see a Â® after laurel and hardy and was co director and producer of this travesty br br questions abound would stan and ollie do fart gags if they were alive today would they glass mummies with broken bottles have stan being smacked in the genitals with a spear and end on a big cgi finale let's hope not br br i did laugh once but i think that was just in disbelief at how terrible it all is why was this film made in the first place who did the makers think would like it possibly the worst movie i've ever seen an absolute abhorrence i grew sick of watching after just the first five minutes about as much fun as having your head trapped in a vice while a red hot poker and stinging nettles are forcibly inserted up your back passage
<START> recently i saw the documentary the revolution will not be televised also know as chÃ¡vez inside the coup at first i thought it showed a genuine inside view of events during the venezuela coup of april 2002 what bothered me though was the fact that the tone of the narration and the accompanying music were suggestive and that at no point any criticism was expressed about hugo chÃ¡vez this is peculiar because if a documentary is giving an non biased account of what happened there should have been some of that too after all chÃ¡vez certainly is not a saint fortunately since the documentary is several years old a lot of additional information is available on the internet nowadays and it was not difficult to find for instance urgent investigation about chavez the coup by the 5 european tv corporations who financed the film which presents blatant falsehoods about venezuela it lists the many errors and intended or unintended falsifications in the documentary just use the title as a search string in google you will find it another interesting document was the video registration of a presentation of the findings of the many errors in this documentary x ray of a lie to me it seems to be a good counterweight to chÃ¡vez inside the coup it's available at video google i strongly advice you after watching chÃ¡vez inside the coup to look at x ray of a lie and then form your opinion my conclusion is that kim bartley and donnacha o'brian were knowingly or not part in chÃ¡vez propaganda
<START> private practice is supposed to be a medical drama so i guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines just by watching house i solved two out of nine medical mysteries before the doctors did boooring seriously if you are a lazy writer why not copy some cases out of older er episodes or some obscure brazilian medical soap house is recent and popular recycling their ideas is hard to get away with br br second biggest complaint these people are supposed to be forty somethings right then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15 year olds is three weeks ie three whole damn episodes of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesn't want to be your friend with benefits it's maybe not because he wants to hurt you but because he doesn't want to risk your friendship the character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you can't really buy into the supposed drama br br and i won't even start complaining about what the show did to everyone's favorite addison as we got to know her in grey's anatomy on a sidenote don't you think it's funny the way addison ends up lusting after loser pete sorry but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with mozart's requiem is a loser phd or not and derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny irritating meredith miles away in rainy seattle apart from that little fling with mark they seemed to be perfect for each other sometimes i think shonda rhimes' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships our first choice is often the right one
<START> from start to finish i laughed real hard throughout the whole movie it's amazing that the groove tube is possibly the granddaddy yet raunchiest of all comedic skit movies this is the way i enjoy watching tv without being bored at flipping channels only to suffer from insomnia for 73 minutes the weird strange humor never stops just think of how all this nonsense laughing can help you enjoy life easier it's way way better than comedy central or any prime time show do yourself a favor and trash all those soft lame romantic comedy movies into the wastebasket better yet tell your box office manager you want the groove tube back on the big screen
<START> this game has the dis honor of being the first game that i have stopped playing right in the middle of and felt like smashing into bits and then burning congratulations first and last tomb raider i will ever play i assure you br br plot just typing that word made me laugh there isn't one neither is there character development we finally have a girl heroine who can take care of herself who isn't a beeping mary sue but unfortunately she dresses like a slut and her breast are huge they had to attract the sexist boy gamers you see anyway all she does is go in tomb after tomb shooting things as she goes along why she does this i have no idea i had subtitles on and the t v as loud as i could and i still didn't understand a damn thing the development or lack there of for her her two friends and the villains were laughable there also will be levels that you have to go through that do not give you any hint on what you have to do next and you literally will be in most of the boring as hell tombs for hours trying to figure out what the hell you are supposed to be doing there is one course out of two in particular with her on a motorbike believe me it is not at all fun that you will be on for atlease an hour with no save point in sight that means you get hit by the other motorist and guys in vans shooting at you or you hit a tree you start the hour long trek over br br boss stupid f ck you know lets makes the levels very long have basically no save points have no story no character development give no variety in game play have most of the music on the longest levels ear bleeding and give no hints whatsoever to the player so they can stay even longer in a place instead of getting to the nonexistent plot br br stupid f ck one those sound like bang up ideas br br stupid f ck two i concur who needs character development plot or unboring game play br br todd i'm sorry sir but these ideas seem like they will extremely p ss the player off br br boss stupid f ck shut up todd you're fired br br game play all she does is shoot of course she can flip while shooting jump while shooting or kick while again shooting but flipping jumping and kicking does not erase the fact that all she is ultimately doing is shooting boring music the intro music is extremely beautiful i love listening to it the in game music goes from tolerable to wanting to cut your ears off br br visuals considering this game was made in 2006 i was expecting the visuals to blow me away well i was blown but definitely not in a good way br br bottom line this game is a plot less no character development mess with a barely dressed unmarysuish thankfully young women in the lead that goes through boring tombs for some boring reason what that might be i couldn't tell you with unimaginative shooting gameplay stay far away from this b s it's gets two stars for having a women who isn't a damsel in distress no matter how scantily clad she might be and the beautiful into music
<START> despite being a huge fan of fred astaire and ginger rogers' movies it wasn't until about 6 years ago that i first saw 'follow the fleet' i knew all the songs from an old astaire rogers record yes vinyl but knew nothing of the plot br br unfortunately while the songs are catchy and ginger rogers' character is sweet and funny you just can't like 'bake baker' while trying to make up to his longtime partner he continually sabotages her career his character doesn't have the usual humour and elan of the other films' astaire characters br br worth watching for the songs and a great solo tap routine by ginger rogers
<START> i thought i had seen this movie twice in fact then i read all the other reviews and they didn't quite match up a man and three young students two girls and a boy go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings i still feel pretty confident that this is the movie i saw despite the discrepancies in the reviews therefore i'm putting my review back if you like the occasional 'b' movie as i do then return to boggy creek is the movie for you whether it's setting the sleep timer and nodding off to your favorite movie bomb or just hanging out with friends boggy creek the mute button and you've got a fun night of improv look out is the legend true i think we just might find out along with a not so stellar cast will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film does our blonde manly young hero have any chest hair will the exceptionally high tech technicolor last the entire film you'll have to watch to find out for yourself
<START> another silent love triangle film from hitchcock not a mystery but very english very well paced and photographed smooth boxer bob corby ian hunter recruits circus boxer one round jack sander carl brisson to be his sparring partner partly to keep the pretty but fickle mabel lilian hall davis nearby there are lots of character actors and grotesquesÂat jack and mabel's wedding the verger standing in the aisle of the church registers shock at the sight of the very tall and the very short men the fat lady the conjoined twins who of course argue about which side of the aisle to sit and the wedding feast is amusing the rest of the movie has jack losing mabel and boxing his way back to her heart or something like that it was another era altogether with the audience in evening dress and the boxers dressing up too when out of the ring the camera angles the pace the use of symbols the cuttingÂall very stylish and masterful the camera work and editing of the last boxing match is very gripping brisson's good looks are well used in this one his smiling is not so oblivious of what's going on around him as he is in hitchcock's the manxman and so is not annoying but can boxers have such dimples
<START> die sieger was highly recommended to be one of the few good action movies made in germany i watched it last night and i must admit that i am deeply disappointed if that is supposed to be the last best hope for entertaining and challenging german action cinema well then there is not much left br br die sieger tries to be sexy daring and furious but it is nothing of that kind the characters are wooden and stereotype and whenever they do something unexpected which doesn't happen too much the act against their nature that makes it hard for me almost impossible to follow them or even identify with them br br most of all i think the film is very bad cast there is not one character in whom i believe maybe the superior officer at the swat unit but that's about it those people that try to look like or act like special units like elite cops i don't believe them not for a second br br the story is not so bad after all but i think it's badly told you don't get to know the bad guy at all for example and when after a very dark show down karl simon the good guy asks his already dead opponent why what for i did ask myself that very same question knowing that dominik graf wouldn't have the answer br br i sincerely hope no i believe that germany can do better even with action films
<START> being from a small town in illinois myself i can instantly relate to this movie considering the era it was made in the townsfolk look uncomfortably like a lot of people i grew up with yes the plot is so so and yes the acting is not going to get nominated for an oscar anytime soon but that isn't the point the point is to suspend reality and just have fun and this movie has fun aplenty from the greedy uncaring banker to the well meaning but dimwitted deputy this movie was made to poke fun at the scifi genre and small town living at it's best who can't smile at the sight of the enforcer drone or the vern droid and i loved the farmzoid wish i had one when i was growing up overall considering the technology they had available at the time this is a pleasant romp into one's childhood when you could sit back on a saturday afternoon popcorn in hand and laugh at the foibles of small town living this is a movie i would watch again and again if for no other reason than to poke fun at myself and my small town ways
<START> i wouldn't be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say this might be a good show this show is only good if you don't know what talent is i won't even say how offensive it is i know it can be offensive to a lot of people because thats not really what bothers me about the show what bothers me is that people watch this and think it's funny it makes me feel like our generation is getting to stupid and i'm actually scared that it will one day be run by people who watch this garbage br br basically the plot is simple it's about an offensive self centered spoiled women sarah silvermen getting through everyday life br br thats it like that hasn't been done a million times in fact almost every joke either has been done or is racist br br sarah also likes to sing i like her voice thats it not the lyrics the lyrics are dreadful which she likes to sing about a lot of things br br if you like to see a hot women put everyone else down and make them feel like crap while at the same time farting and saying crap about every race then this show is for you
<START> i first started watching this show probably around the year of 2003 or 2004 with my friends of course at the time i was younger and enjoyed some of the jokes on this show i was 11 in 2003 and i am 14 now 2007 though my age probably plays a major role in how i judge this show after reading other's reviews i have come to see that after the third season this show went down the tubes i agree this show is obnoxious repetitive and usually focuses on the same plot br br the show revolves around timmy turner who was granted two fairy godparents because basically his life was horrible his parents were never around and he had a nasty baby sitter the plot of the entire show is that this kid timmy and his godparents always wish up some destruction that cannot be prevented by making another wish because something in da rules says they can't the show has a lot of lines that keep being repeated like magic cannot break true love super toilet or even just some scummy jokes lines that nickelodeon probably thought was funny and decided to put in the episode various times br br the show is aimed at kids younger than 10 because it involves gross situations and kid humor that most kids of my age wouldn't care for the character voice selection could've been better too timmy has an extremely loud shrill feminine voice as does cosmo wanda sounds like an old lady timmy's dad sounds like some announcer or game show host timmy's mom's voice is too exaggerated to sound feminine attitudes in this show are in some episodes timmy talks back and acts spoiled and snobbish wanda apparently is smart and wise cosmo is stupid dumb and incapable of thinking as is timmy's dad timmy's mom seems to end up doing whatever timmy's dad does br br the show is too far flung from reality to get my likings anymore maybe as a younger kid i could see more of the humor in this show but as i grow up it really grows old and not to sound conceded or trashing but the show does have that mentality that makes you want to commit homicidal activity towards the characters a show like this just has to be your attitude if you know what i mean if not it basically disgusts you
<START> robot jox doesn't suffer from story or bad effects i mean this was 1990 if you know what i'm talking about robocop 2 still used the stop animation as most of the movies did throughout the '80s if you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that was available to them at the time it wasn't until terminator 2 judgment day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized and story boarders began to use that motive but you'll have fond memories of transformers gundam wing even power rangers if you watch this film the enemy robot is very menacing it makes you not want to face the man without a really good back up plan and there are some great moments within this film a traitor spy is working within their midsts who you think is on your side backing you up all the way could be the person you didn't expect him her to be and that's very troublesome to think so don't you agree
<START> i was disgusted by this movie no it wasn't because of the graphic sex scenes it was because it ruined the image of artemisia gentileschi this movie does not hold much truth about her and her art it shows one piece of art work that she did judith beheading holofernese but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first judith for a year after the trial br br i don't know if you understood this from the movie probably not tassi was not a noble character he raped artemisia it was not love it was rape he did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured according to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew artemisia aka had sex with while she states over and over again it's true br br i encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she is really about don't base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie i encourage you to do some research artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work br br don't see the movie but find out the true story of artemisia
<START> i suppose the ultimate curse of attending the toronto film festival is your release date time table get messed up quite frankly i'm just happy fido got picked up for us distribution in any case br br ever seen shaun of the dead good how about lassie able to reconcile the two well if you can your name might be andrew currie canadian helmer of the first ever family themed zombie comedy or zomedy seriously that's what the press book in toronto called it though not as violent dry or british as shaun of the dead fido remains true to its roots a devotion to old 50s black and white television including both lassie and the infamous sci fi pulp that was being pumped out during the period br br fido's talented headliners carrie anne moss billy connelly dylan baker and tim blake nelson stand as a testament to the brilliance of the script the film explores all the implications of its premise a world where zombies have been converted to servants because of the sheer number of them due to a strange accident what would you use your new undead servant for a butler manual labor a pet unspeakable acts fido tackles all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly classy way with much thanks to the work of connelly as one of said zombies and young tv actor k'sun ray who seems at times to be a better young elijah wood than the young elijah wood was br br if you're expecting another shaun of the dead don't waste your time there's not nearly enough gore and pokes at the genre to satisfy you and you'll just leave the theater bitter and depressed but if you're willing to take a look at what happens to shaun of the dead when it jumps across the lake you're in for a treat think of fido as the sensitive more often beaten up little brother to shaun of the dead's rebellious loser and you're starting to get the drift if you like or at least tolerate zombies small children and loads of deadpan satire fido's the film for you if that's not the case well you know the drill just hit 'em square between the eyes
<START> well for starters this actually was the most elegant clausen film to this date br br the man's always got a sense for characters with a slice of humor to them but i think that he in this movie adds a dimension unparrallel to anything he's made earlier his work has in very black n' white words been accepted by the broad but not that critical audience and we've always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way of letting the audience know what he needs to say br br in villa paranoia however for the first time he surprises with an unseen wisdom and a respect for the minorities not only the ethnic but also the normal people you tend to forget set in jutland in 'the country' it deals with the everlasting issue of lack of love but in a close and at times brutal way that keeps you looking and keeps you focused and on top of that he himself manages to play a b d a true b d who wants the right thing but has no clue how to get there and people therefore suffer bitterly br br i'd have to say it's one of the best movies i've seen this year and i'm greatly anticipating his next
<START> i have enjoyed criminal intent series of law and order for a long time kathryn erbe det alexandra eames the female detective is rather hard and seems a bit bitter in the criminal intent series see her other side in this movie br br this movie shows the marvelous soft side of this talented actresses and if you are a criminal intent fan this movie is a revelry in her acting and you get a pretty darn good yarn of family hardships in the south br br i did not like albert finneys role in this movie because he did such a convincing acting job of the older southern fellow that is hard headed and intolerant and unaccepting of change he reminds me of so many men from my youth and the portrayal is divine but you will likely find him hard to like in this movie br br katryn erbe is easy to like in this movie and why i recommend it as a 10 star for criminal intent law and order fans
