<START> i was very disappointed in this movie plotwise it was weak bordering on silly souls who can affect reality in the way they do a mission apparently critical to the soul hunters entrusted to one of their younger members and the whole b story with the holobrothel and the lawsuit against the station was so awful that at one point i blurted out to the television why are you wasting my time with this br br thematically river of souls didn't really go into the question of the soul in any more depth than the original episode soul hunter did we see that soul hunters can make mistakes but we still don't get a feeling for their culture are there any female soul hunters br br the acting was okay given the material they had to work with and the special effects especially the planetscapes in the first act were very impressive but overall i'd say give this one a miss
<START> just when i thought i would finish a whole year without giving a single movie a bomb rating a friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night i feared the worst knowing its reputation and it was as god awful as i'd anticipated this is a mexican made mess dubbed into english and produced by k gordon murray it's got terrible sets and effects and features a rather frightening santa who doesn't operate at the north pole but instead from a cloud in outer space and who doesn't have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is the opening sequence where st nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages seems to go on forever and with no story obviously this santa claus doesn't observe the child labor laws br br eventually we get some nasty and slinky red suited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to earth just to make little kids naughty and turn santa's christmas eve rounds into a nightmare watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience and it's bound to frighten little children and turn them off santa claus and the holidays forever oddly the name of jesus christ is mentioned often in this christmas film which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on this easily makes my personal list of the worst movie i've ever seen but i'm sure that's nothing unique
<START> when great director actor combinations are talked about the team of j lee thompson and charles bronson is not usually mentioned probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre unfortunately kinjite forbidden subjects falls in the latter br br that's sad because kinjite could have been a whole lot better but for the life of me i don't understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing japanese girl a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage has run out that might have been good for another film altogether but it served no purpose here br br a straightforward cop drama with charles bronson as a vice cop who's seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals that part could also have used a little explaining as well but he's going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner perry lopez are going to locate a captured japanese school girl br br bronson's time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper a stylish murderous pimp played by jaime fernandez is the guy and he and bronson have some history in fact in the film's best scene bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire br br at one point fernandez happens to spot bronson and lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after his rolex snack he sprays the place with an uzi killing everyone but bronson and lopez i really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the lapd after fernandez but that's another terribly big hole in the plot br br still there is a very rough justice in the end for fernandez i wish the whole film had been better though this was the last film of the bronson thompson team and j lee thompson's last as a director he should have gone out with something better
<START> the box for to die for suckered me in a shirtless hunky guy and the promise of some laughs and sex there was plenty of thomas arklie simon who's easy on the eyes but no laughs and little sexiness br br the couple mark and simon have allegedly been together several years but neither character is interesting enough to care about so it's hard to imagine that they care about each other the fault seems to lie in the script not the performances both actors do the best they can with what they're given br br the ending is sappy and unaffecting well not totally unaffecting i felt relief that it was over br br if you're looking for a movie about gay relationships and aids that's funny parting glances is far better
<START> this film aka the four hundred blows is a mistranslation faire les 400 coups means to live a wild life as a french i'm stunned when i see the popularity of this good but by no means outstanding film 1 it's not the first film of the nouvelle vague move check agnes varda's la pointe courte 1956 alain resnais's hiroshima mon amour 1958 claude chabrol's le beau serge 1958 are anterior historically les 400 coups comes after 2 the nouvelle vague was sometimes ponderous and hard on their predecessors overnight julien duvivier henri george clouzot claude autant lara yves allÃ©gret and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion this selfishness and this contempt is typically nouvelle vague you 've never heard or read the great generation of the thirties renoir carnÃ© grÃ©millon duvivier already feyder laugh at say maurice tourneur or max linder so thanks to truffaut and co some people will never discover some gems of the french fifties or forties duvuvier's sous le ciel de paris autant lara's douce yves allÃ©gret's une si jolie petite plage and manÃ¨ges the novelle vague clique went as far as saying that william wyler georges stevens and fred zinemann were worthless 3 les 400 coups is technically rather disappointing it's very academic the story is as linear as it can be the teachers are caricatures and the mother claire maurier delivers such memorable lines as you've got to be a french circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous it is well your father 's got only his brevet junior school diploma and as for me i've got only my high school diploma you've got to know that circa 1960 hardly 10 of the pupils had the hsd in france antoine doinel should have been proud of his mother after all she wants him to have diplomas who can blame her 4 compared to the innovations of hiroshima mon amour which features a brand new form and a new fragmented content les 400 coups pales into significance truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior jules and jim helped by the incomparable jeanne moreau 5 the interpretation is rather stiff jean pierre lÃ©aud arguably listenable when dubbed in english is still decent but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation 6 the topic stolen childhood had better days before julien duvivier's poil de carotte luis bunuel's los olvidados and will have after maurice pialat's l'enfance nue kenneth loach's kes i do not want to demean truffaut his movie is not bad but frankly french movie buffs prefer jules and jim l'enfant sauvage a film honest true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault l'argent de poche as academic as 400 coups but much more funny or his nice hitchcock pastiche vivement dimanche br br
<START> we saw this at one of the local art movie theaters in the montrose area of houston tx it was a total surprise compared to the write up in the theater's newsletter but we were both blown away by the artistry it was beautifully done and apparently photographed in a schloss german name for chÃ¢teau somewhere in the munich area it is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relationships of a group of twentyish men and women isolated from the day to day constraints it is fantastic on more levels than i can remember we came home after the movie and talked and talked until about 4 am the next morning br br the version we saw was in english mostly so there must be at least two versions since the first reviewer saw the movie in probably its original german version i searched and searched for a video tape version but never came up with anything would absolutely love to have a vhs or dvd version of this it explores relationships at a fundamental level and is also a great tutorial on how to relate to your partner if anyone knows the writer director please convince him to release again preferably on dvd these days i cannot even imagine getting tired of watching the candid performance of the actors who are now probably all in their forties please please bring it back
<START> i just got this video used and i was watching it last night the acting started out extremely bad hey hey twister but got very good soon after wards the tornadoes looked extremely fake and many of the cgi effects were very dodgy but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done and just about on par with movies like twister the scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too the story was very well written and it's refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old disaster formulas movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 years br br while this movie had a very weird mix of fx and acting quality this merits an a in my book
<START> i have seen several comments here about brando using a southern accent some of which felt it was a mistake when this movie was made racism and discrimination were very strong in the south the jim crow laws were still in effect civil rights was in it's infancy could this have possibly been a subtle social commentary a southern man in love with a woman of another race the same way mash was a subtle criticism of the viet nam war any thoughts br br another comment was made about myoshi umeki appearing cold anyone who has been in japan would understand the japanese people at least in my experience did not tend to show emotion in front of strangers there were strict social rules especially for men meeting single women americans in japan were totally foreign to this culture and the blunt attempts to meet women were shocking to the ladies one trait of the japanese was to smile when embarrassed or uncomfortable which many american servicemen took as a sign that their advances were welcomed also remember that at the time represented in the movie japan had just been defeated and the occupying forces were treated with reluctant acceptance i think myoshi umeki gave a very credible performance of what her situation would have been watching her interaction with the american actors brought back several memories of my own experiences in the country i was able to meet a pair of lovely young ladies who after i convinced them i was not the typical american male taught me their language and their culture during my time in their country
<START> as a big fan of gorilla movies in general i anticipated that this one would be great and as for the gorilla effects they were quite good however that is the only thing i can write about this flop the film claims to be based on a true story but in effect it does not even come close to what actually happened to buddy who in real life was the famous gargantua sold to ringling bros by our supposed heroic gertrude lintz known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly had her animals' welfare in the best interest as far as buddy being portrayed as becoming aggressive this was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla in real life resort to such behavior buddy did in fact escape his wooden crate not a plush cage room as depicted in movie during a storm to seek shelter and comfort in the house which frightened gertrude lintz into selling him no buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise he was abandoned in a wooden crate deep in the back of a garage for some time with only a single light bulb for comfort and then sold to the circus where he actually lived a better life having peanuts thrown at him until he died historically the oldest living gorilla on record by the way before a show in miami notice also in the film how buddy grows older but the chimpanzees never age the chimps by the way were not raised simultaneously with other animals including buddy as portrayed in the film
<START> like last year i didn't manage to sit through the whole thing okay so chris rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging or rather out of all the total bores packed into the theatre he at least wasn't in the top 10 most boring a lot of the presenters on the other hand were in this coveted top 10 i hadn't known that the whole thing had been done by autocue although i knew it was scripted but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to insert expression look away from the cue and stumble over simple words natalie portmanÂif there's no director she's gone the night of fancy dresses and boring speeches was long and tedious beyonce knowles butchered some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and clips adam sandler wins the worst presenter award br br for helping me write this review i'd like to thank my mum my dad my lawyers and my pedicurist for all believing in me and i'd like to point out that i have a high metabolism and of course i haven't been starving myself for a month i'm not going to cry thank you
<START> this show is unbelievable in that what it represents and what it focuses on and words cannot describe how insane et is they will report anything if a celebrity is even remotely indirectly connected to the story et will report on it if a dog poop in the tom cruise's yard they will report on it if a celebrity dies they will talk about it for weeks on end to the point where the public envy that celebrity if a celebrity is on trial et will report it for months on end there is no end to what this show will reports and no time frame that dictates how long they will focus on a story is it even considered legitimates reporting the reports are so dang annoying too with harsh rambling voices and end with an unnecessary pause to convey a sense of important i cannot watch this show without questioning humanity's existence et is one big reason i avoid pre evening shows in general i regret that imdb can only allow a minimum of one star rating and not zero or even in the negatives for this show deserve 10 stars
<START> this 1986 italian french remake of the 1946 film of the same name turns up the heat early and doesn't let us come up for air the story is about a high school student federico pitzalis who can't keep his eyes off the mysteriously beautiful young woman played by dutch phenom maruschka detmers who lives next door to the school one day he follows her and his persistence pays off there's only one problem she's engaged to a sketchy character riccardo de torrebruna who may or may not have committed a heinous crime and if he repents will probably be let off with a slap on the wrist also the young woman is a little funny in the head and this is corroborated when we discover she has been seeing the boy's father who is a psychiatrist giulia's emotional instability is only equalled by her prodigious sexual desires hot hot hot from the word go with handsome leads and a bombshell performance from detmers who plays us like a yo yo as she does the boy from scene to scene with enough suspense to keep us guessing right up until and even after the end available in r and x rated versions
<START> whoo boy that was definitely one of the worst flicks i've seen all summer granted it was on sci fi and i don't watch much sci fi but man talk about a razor thin plot and two dimensional characters to the max br br the characters were stereotypical and overdone the plot and setting were unbelievable the vampires were less intimidating more funny looking the gore was unnecessary the special effects were down right horrible and the ending well the only thing unpredictable about the ending was when suddenly the tomboy becomes a lesbian and starts to do it with the female vampire which by the way isn't really all that hot considering it occurs for about three seconds in which you're closer to what the hell then man that's hot if this ever appears in reruns god forbid don't watch it
<START> the main character lance barton gets killed and to heaven before his time when heaven learns about the mistake he is given the body of just deceased rich old and white mr wellington br br a young black guy in a old white mans body still behaving like the young black man is maybe funny if you see it done by an old white actor in this movie i ended up reminding myself several times chris rock is supposed to be an old white guy br br the whole concept does not play as intended the illusion is not transported well and the love story is not believable at all the fact that all you see is chris rock playing a young black guy because the old white person everyone is supposed to see is only shown in small scenes is to much of a challenge for the viewers suspension of disbelief
<START> and this movie has crossed it i have never seen such a terrible movie in my life i mean a kid's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled a snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible this was a pitiful excuse for a movie
<START> what can i say about this movie i have seen it quite a few times since the first time when i was around 6 i have seen the english version and it is done very well it is a great movie for all ages but it is directed more for children i love the childlike humor and appreciate it if you have not seen it you should try to rent a copy you will not be disappointed
<START> i don't think i've really ever given walter matthau his due as a comedic performer he's certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles but i guess i always put his success down to his characters' grumpiness and ruthlessness a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co star jack lemmon and i suppose a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures watching gene saks' 'the odd couple 1968 ' adapted from a popular neil simon play the realisation suddenly clicked matthau is in his own right absolutely hilarious initially striking the audience as filthy crude and generally unappealing his oscar madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own at the same time while holding his own as a comedian his interplay with lemmon is of course pitch perfect indeed the film rightly belongs to both actors who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves let alone together br br calling to mind billy wilder's screenplay for 'the apartment 1960 ' this neil simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise compulsive house cleaner felix unger lemmon having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years attempts to commit suicide but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window dejected he arrives at the house of good friend oscar matthau a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat oscar kindly offers felix a place to stay but is soon overwhelmed by his friend's finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness the pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement with felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantly nagging wife and oscar as the sloppy unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he's supposed to this is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks and by the end of it we can completely sympathise with felix's ex wife who remains unseen br br 'the odd couple' is a terrific comedy most of all because it has a lot of heart for all their arguing it's obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other most movingly seen when felix tries to launch into a furious tirade instead Â perhaps inadvertently Â ending up informing oscar how tops he his the pair's four poker buddies john fiedler herb edelman david sheiner and larry haines are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance but you can't deny that they've got the best of intentions their decision to treat felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory but maybe being ignored wasn't quite the correct solution to felix's gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays i was recently disappointed by wilder's 'the seven year itch 1955 this film doesn't simply strike at the same chord throughout and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed through tears laughter and much disagreement
<START> still being of school age and having to learn shakespeare almost constantly for the last four years which is very off putting of any writer no matter how good i didn't really expect to enjoy this film when my english teacher put it on i thought it'd be the typical english lesson movie bad acting awfully shot badly edited and the dreaded awful old dialog so as you can tell i was all but ready to go into a coma from the go however i watched and much to my disturbance found myself not only paying attention but actually enjoying the movie too this production of hamlet is possibly one of the best drama movies i have seen in a long time and it really brings to life what i expect shakespeare wanted his plays to be like well with the difference that this is cinema much better than my english teacher harking over the text ever possibly could the story is good the dialog seems to flow with an unexpected grace that is far from boring though a little hard to keep up with if you aren't used to shakespeare's language and even the smallest parts are performed with a skill you wouldn't expect mainly perhaps due to the staggering number of cameos this movie has brian blessed and charlton heston are as great as you'd expect these two veterans to be even in such small parts but it is robin williams as osric and billy crystal as the gravedigger who really stand out giving such minor parts an unexpected zest as well as offering some comic relief amidst the tragedy br br the main stars of course are also wonderful kenneth branagh excels as hamlet bringing not only the confusion and pain required to the roll but also a sort of sardonic air which plays beautifully in the comic scenes making the movie as a whole much more watchable the other major players are also good but it is kenneth branagh who stands head and shoulders above the rest in the title role br br the set pieces too are often quite stunning giving a refreshing change to the danky old castle corridors we're used to seeing in shakespeare productions as well as a real sense of the country around them br br of course the movie taken as a movie in its own right is not without faults but no major ones the pacing is the only real problem i can think of offhand as well as the prose for anyone not used to as i said shakesperean language and especially when compared to the sort of shakespeare productions i'm used to seeing in class it really is quite brilliant it's even made me rethink my previous typical teenager stance on shakespeare that his plays are boring i came to the conclusion it's not the plays that are boring merely the teachers who recite them in class if only they made all of his plays into movies such as this one english students in schools everywhere might have a higher opinion of the bard br br overall 7 10
<START> as a disclaimer i've seen the movie 5 6 times in the last 15 years and i only just saw the musical this week this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical however it tainted me when i watched the musical br br i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role along with kasey i think her 'let me dance for you scene' is one of the best parts of the movie a worthwhile addition compared to the musical the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger easier to do in the movie of course the decors lighting dancing and singing are also much superior in the movie which should be expected and was indeed delivered br br the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical
<START> spoilers ahead russian fantasy actioner and i use the term loosely that i've been trying to watch for over a year i've finally gotten to the end and now i wish i didn't put in the repeated effort br br in an effort to save two hours of your life i'm going to tell you he plot a guy who has the ability to project a long blade out of his arm returns home to see his mom things turn ugly after he is beaten up by the mafia boyfriend of an old girl friend he takes revenge on the guy when he brings the girl home the guys mafia mom sends her men out to get revenge while the cops begin looking for him as well br br very little is said no explanation is really given for anything like why they lock id girlfriend in an asylum and the action for the most part is all off screen the film essentially consists of a guy who looks like adrian brody looking intense and not saying anything killing people off screen most of the action happens off screen it looks good is well acted and had there been some form of reason for what is going on it might have been a good film hell i would have liked some sense of real character development or back story all we know is that the guy was picked on as a kid the movie runs the better part of two hours and it feels like its six if they weren't going to tell us anything they could have at least picked up the pace so it seemed like it was moving too fast no instead we get the hero on a boat the hero in a bus the hero walking the hero looking disturbed hero with his girl it really annoyed me since i think this could have been a good film if they had simply done something or had someone actually say something meaningful other than give instructions to get this guy br br 4 out of 10 its about four hours all my attempts to see this i'll never get back only for those who want to see a brooding russian action film with very little action
