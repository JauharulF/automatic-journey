<START> the story is quite original but the movie is kinda slow building up to the point where they steal the cars its kinda nice though to watch them prepare the stealing too but the actual stealing should've been more in picture however the stunt work on this movie was excellent and it is definetly a movie you have to see 7 10
<START> slaughter high the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to hell a very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre slashings and a final half hour that sucked on a whole new level of suckiness the guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released if you wanna rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember choose life
<START> what happened what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it actually it never really got going there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it steve martin who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters kate and angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot
<START> considering the lack of art with in african cinema or black american cinema the idea offers a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and dealers but the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short but it is the unstated assertion of independence from these themes that is most sticking the genre is unique and not the typical expectation it is almost this departure which first catches the eye so watching it twice is critical the film has an aesthetic quality which lends its self to the true art of cinema br br and it is this true art that with an african voice that is extremely rare the film doesn't copy to attain its message it innovates and provokes by pulling at subtle stereotypes not racial but character based stereotypes from a writers perspective the film is brilliant it carries multiply messages which include a very rapid character development it must be remember this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish character very quickly the usage of colour texture and music is also to be commended but considering the director owen alik shahadah's last venture 500 years later music is to be expected but from a theme point of view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satire eludes indirectly to a social problemÂbrilliant stuff
<START> poor acting no script no plot no convincing killer no suspense no original setups it uses the same closet under the bed person behind you in the mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring and not in a foreshadowing way either and the fact that nobody ever really gets killed at least not on screen which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve more cheated for spending money on their admission ticket its a horror film w o any horror lmao the most you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheet br br you have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this or you were high drunk at the time br br honestly i have a life and don't bother writing reviews that often unless i really really hated something or enjoyed it tremendously br br but this film is awful and i feel i have a duty of sorts to warn you not to give your money to hollywood and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again br br it is one thing to rent a bad movie at blockbuster from the weinsteins its another when you have to sit through it in a theater br br also in case you want some remake nostalgia forget it this is not a remake nor is it a re imagining it is not scary nor engaging nor is it satisfying enough to be funny like others on imdb have claimed it is just stale and booooring br br here is what you will take away from this film remembering the scar on brittany snow's head that stands out more than the plot the fact that jonathan schaech must be having some sexual affair with j s cardone of the forsaken to have gotten another role as a killer because he is as frightening as my poodle and too cute to kill just about anyone and that for some reason duh everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back what kind of person would not get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow doesn't show up this is my warning to you do not waste you're money like i did the original sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for jamie lee curtis fans though no way near as bad as this piece of crap sorry to sound vulgar or rude but once you see this you will understand why i say what i say
<START> almost in the same league as yonfan's rather atrocious color blossoms spider lillies drives the point home that you can make cutting edge cinema without the edge or much in the way of cutting it's a taiwanese film which in this day and age is becoming a novelty at an alarming pace but more than that tidbit we can find very little in the way of the noteworthy here br br you should know that ostensibly spider lillies is also a lesbian themed story but in every aspect this is nothing but a plastic ploy to lure in the easily seduced and gullible in several ways we have here a repeat of fellow recent taiwan release eternal summer then it was gay men getting the shortchange treatment now we have the same thing with women zero chou presents for your non existent edification a tale likely to titillate at most a fifteen year old they managed some of the art house stance but in the end this results in a most inane simply uninteresting foray br br the hong kong angle comes in the form of isabella leung bug me not isabella diary here sporting her most butch look yet although somewhat likable in her previous jobs isabella in spider lillies is listless and lacking in most departments either her heart wasn't into it or the whole lesbian drama pitch didn't quite appeal to her sensibilities br br she does a taipei tattoo artist who's shy reclusive and in charge of a mentally challenged younger brother played by john shen who thankfully grants the movie its only thespian related redeeming feature isabella's character oddly named takeko but supposedly hailing from hong kong soon hooks up with disaffected youth jade rainie yang from fondly recalled meteor garden the latter lives with her grandmother and has a whole list of grievances due to being left behind by her parents and life in general sure the grandmother component works well and is touching but otherwise jade as a protagonist is just as unmoving as her counterpart takeko br br the two women share a past and lots of inadequately covered angst with jade working as a webcam girl while takeko keeps her father's legacy alive with a unique tattoo of a spider lilly emblazoned on her arm jade also wants to acquire this very design which leads to takeko exploring internal feelings of the issue via flashbacks and rather minimal discourse with the spunky jade br br well if there's little discourse to write the homebase about is at least the intercourse memorable in a word no they kiss and feign doing the nasty close to the end but just as eternal summer reminded us not long ago there's a gulf measured in lightyears between showing sexual content and making ticket buyers think they're about to see sexual content br br this cynical expectation building seals spider lillies' fate with a weak story ho hum acting and an overall dearth of relics to take away from the theater with you this one kind of makes color blossoms look good come to think of it at least there we got a bit of teresa cheung's mammaries no spider lillies is no av masterpiece and should be stricken from the playlist of even the most mundane and timid glb movie festival br br amazingly for a pseudo indie release not even the soundtrack and cinematography produce moments of inspiration that's just as well since it makes passing on spider lillies much easier believe you us avoid it and you won't be missing out on anything good br br rating
<START> cosby in my opinion is a must see cbs hit i'm not sure if i've never seen every episode but i still enjoyed it it's hard to say which one is my favorite also i really loved the theme song if you ask me even though i liked everyone it would have been nice if madeline kahn hadn't passed away during the show's run since that happened i've always wondered what the show would have been like everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen on tbs now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
<START> and i gave it a high 7 br br why because it bloody well rocked at the time when there were so many other shows on that were tied to toys games this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories as others have said here it was ahead of its time br br sadly this is why the show was doomed they have released 4 dvds with 16 episodes of the series so far i am hoping that more come out br br how does this compare watching it now 20 years after it first came out i don't know i still like it despite the sometimes clunky animation and that imho is it's only flaw the writing was almost top notch and way ahead of the competition br br i do hope for more dvds or even a set of all the episodes in proper order the dvds are good but i don't think the stories are in their proper order but despite this the show rocked
<START> viggo mortensen stars as a new inmate of a haunted prison in which the warden played well by lane smith has a grisly secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and inmates are being slaughtered by a supernatural presence lincoln kilpatrick is the lifer who knows the secret and is scared for his life when i think prison movies i always think action movies starring stallone or van damme or high caliber dramas such as shawshank redemption or the green mile however i didn't expect a ghost story more along the lines of exorcist iii prison however is an atmospheric effort and it certainly remains the best movie of renny harlin's career the movie is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of at the time unknowns lane smith comes off the best because his warden isn't the usual clichÃ© of evil personified but rather nervous and twitchy which adds some credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectations br br out of 4 good
<START> irwin allen was great all of his tv shows had a great pilot or first episode the rest were basically rip offs of his other shows a few episodes of swiss family robinson were rip offs of his older tv shows one episode of swiss family is identical to an episode of land of the giants when a member of the party needs an appendix operation the show was high budget and too expensive to continue irwin lost his touch with tv shows after the 60s the acting is strong with martin milner child stars got there starts with this show like willie ames and helen hunt one bright spot is when irwin allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption dubbing him the master of disaster
<START> i just finished watching the 139 min version widescreen with some friends and we were blown away i won't bother repeating what others have said what the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun the huge battle is exhausting afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that didn't keep us from being completely involved and entertained br br there is one thing that nearly ruined it and that was the horrific music songs blues country folk and rock ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all broke out in laughter it's hideous you have been warned but the story and storytelling keeps you grounded br br there are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera there are many uses of silence as well as slow motion photography that work beautifully i really wish i could erase the music but alas br br seek this out it's fun it's different and it takes you to places you wouldn't expect and that's very refreshing
<START> i am dumbfounded that i actually sat and watched this i love independent films horror films and the whole zombie thing in general but when you add ninga's you've crossed a line that should never be crossed i hope the people in this movie had a great time making it then at least it wasn't a total waste you'd never know by watching it though script are you kidding acting i think even the trees were faking cinematography well there must've been a camera there period i don't think there was any actual planning involved in the making of this movie such a total waste of time that i won't prolong it by commenting further
<START> thank the lord for martin scorsese and his love of the movies br br this is the perfect introduction into the mind of the most talented american artist working in cinema today and i couldn't recommend it more i was enthralled through the whole thing and you will be too just relax and let him take you on a ride through his world you'll love it
<START> everyone does things that they later regret things that they wish they could blame on drugs or alien possession things that although seem rational at the time later reveal themselves to be engraved invitations for suffering and endless recriminations of stupidity br br for some people it is signing the note for the new hummer for others it is picking up a homicidal hitchhiker for still others it is sending their bank account information to third world millionaires mysteriously strapped for cash br br for me it was a film br br d war dragon wars in hindsight i should have guessed how environmentally friendly and thoroughly recycled this movie would turn out to be from its stuttered and repeating title but with my willing suspension of disbelief intact and a naive faith stemming from the cool looking poster in the lobby i really wanted this film to work sadly by the time the old man in the pawnshop explained the entire backstory fifteen minutes into the picture i had the sudden sinking revelation that comes from knowing every plot point of a still unseen film and worse i knew just how badly every point would all suck br br let me be perfectly clear here the english language lacks sufficient nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe just how bad this film really is br br as for knowing all the twists of movie i was wrong in the spirit of the old godzilla films whose scales this one is not worthy to fill it conveniently sprouted extra sub plots every time the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialogue br br it was infested with close calls miraculous escapes and concentrated deposits of poorly explained angst br br this film is what would happen if you gave the produces of the mighty morphing power rangers access to the national defense budget and lots of liquor br br let me try to explain br br imagine you could get a hold of all the coolest looking set pieces from successful action movies of the last decade first take the rasta talking army of amphibians from star wars episode one and remove their prozac until they are ready to club navy seals br br next take close approximations of kira knightly and tom cruise you can even call him ethan as a subtle nod to the mission impossible franchise and give them lots of film noir narration so no one get confused while trying to follow the wading pool depths of their thoughts br br finally add a raspy voiced villain in pointy armor worthy of a lord of the rings yardsale and a couple of giant cobras angry at having their scenes deleted from latest edition of king kong and lay them all out in no particular order in modern day los angeles br br now run to the drugstore to find something for your sudden migraine when you return puree these ingredients until any overlooked hint of originality is dissolved into a homogenized mass of cheese and serve semi gelatinous br br at several points during this picture i found myself saying out loud make the bad movie stop and breaking into tears br br to call this a b movie would be giving it an undeserved promotion after summer school and a lot of physical therapy it might possibly pass for a c level film if you could somehow sleep through most of it br br in short if you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn and the need to punish yourself for hideous unspoken sins against humanity dragon wars might just be the film for you
<START> it seems a shame that greta garbo ended her illustrious career at the age of 36 with this ridiculous mistaken identity marital romp coming off the success of her first romantic comedy ernst lubitsch's masterful ninotchka 1939 where she was ideally cast as an austere russian envoy garbo is reunited with her leading man melvyn douglas for a sitcom level story that has her playing karin borg a plain jane ski instructor who impulsively marries publishing executive larry blake when he becomes smitten with her once he makes clear that work is his priority karin inadvertently decides to masquerade as her high living twin sister katherine to test her husband's fidelity when he is back in manhattan br br it's surprising that this infamous 1941 misfire was directed by george cukor who led garbo to her greatest dramatic performance in 1937's camille because this is as unflattering a vehicle as one could imagine for the screen legend only someone with carole lombard's natural sense of ease and mischief could have gotten away with the shenanigans presented in the by the numbers script by s n behrman salka viertel and george oppenheimer mgm's intent behind this comedy was to contemporize and americanize garbo's image for wartime audiences whom the studio heads felt were not interested in the tragic period characters she favored in the thirties br br however garbo appears ill at ease mostly as the bogus party girl katherine and especially compared to expert farceurs like douglas and constance bennett as romantic rival griselda photographed unflatteringly by joseph ruttenberg garbo looks tired in many scenes and downright hideous in her teased hairdo for the chica choca dance sequence the story ends conventionally but with the addition of a lengthy physical sequence where larry tries to maneuver his skis on a series of mountain cliffs that unfortunately reminds me of sonny bono's death roland young and ruth gordon in a rare appearance at this point of her career show up in comic supporting roles as douglas' associates this movie is not yet on dvd and i wouldn't consider it priority for transfer as it represents a curio in garbo's otherwise legendary career she was reportedly quite unhappy during the filming i can see why
<START> ok i admit i'm one of those nerds who have spent all to many hours with my beloved dvd player and my wonderful television set watching science fiction series star trek next generation was my first space date and since then i've switched partners regularly i've seen'em all it seems and my favorites are Â«lexxÂ» Â«farscapeÂ» and the new Â«battlestar galacticaÂ» in other words the newest state of the art space operas but i also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones the cheap ones like the magnificent four seasoned bbc show Â«blakes7Â» here the budgets are smaller than hobbits the special effects seem to be made on a commodore 64 but who cares when the scripts are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor the acting dead serious and at times even high class br br but why do they always speak english in the space future because this is not the future it's fantasy for kids still it can be irritating at times me being a norwegian have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series like science fiction for scandinavian viewers i never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened but it did actually once and even in my own homeland norway i was two years old when the so called fjernsynsteatret tv theater section of our national public service channel nrk produced this three episode version of blindpassasjer the stowaway br br when i first heard of it i was not surprised of the fact that until this day the show has only been screened once in norway making it impossible for me to actually see it it went on swedish danish and finnish television also in it's time but that was a long time ago there have been no video or dvd release of it not a surprise either and when it was screened on an art house cinema this happened in bergen a city far far away from oslo where i live and then there's another fact about Â«blindpassasjerÂ» that didn't surprise me that it was written by the two norwegian authors tor Ãge bringsvÃ¦rd and jon bing bing bringsvÃ¦rd this duo basically introduced the scifi genre to norwegians in the seventies they published anthologies and wrote what they called fable prose in my opinion bringsvÃ¦rd is the most interesting of the two writers and has written several great and entertaining novels masterpieces even some of them hilarious such as Â«bazarÂ» and Â«syvsoverskens dystre frokostÂ» no other than this guy also an acclaimed dramatist could construct the script of Â«blindpassasjerÂ» br br when i finally got to watch it it was because a strange swede who recorded the three episodes on vcr in the 80's eventually managed to transform it to dvd and give it to me he was a nice bloke so i sat down and watched it with swedish subtitles bad sound and some scrapes and errors but the thing came through and i was surprised that i eventually came to love it br br the exterior scenes with the spaceships and planets are better than the ones in blakes7 and the credit goes to caprino studios who made the famous flÃ¥klypa grand prix and the interior of the marco polo the space ship works better than i'd expected the acting is typically theatrical but it works better than when they play ibsen to put it mildly and bjÃ¸rn floberg carries his role solidly as does trini lund the legendary actress henny moan delivers her lines in a serious and laid back tone which fits the genre but this is an ensemble play and i'm happy to say that ola b johannesen carries his mustache with nobility and marit Ãstbye is a really hot space chic of my standards br br but is it really that good well one have to swallow the rather abrupt ending the pretentious criticism of Â«modern societyÂ» but yes it's well not really really really fantastic but charming cool nostalgic and pleasant one and a half hour of classic norwegian scifi
<START> i liked this tv show because it was it's own thing a girl who is on her sixteenth birthday finds out that she is a witch and her she lives with her aunties in the house and they are both witches as well well this took her about a few weeks of getting used to when she used her powers for the first time it was so funny because she turned her enemy into a pineapple she had to turn back time and repeat a day this series is really cool and it is a typical teenage series but it wore thin when she moved out of her house and to an apartment with her fellow college friends and then it got boring and i stopped watching i loved her aunties they were so funny and the other one was really ditzy i loved valerie and i hated sabrina's enemy libby she was ugly
<START> what a joke i am watching it on channel 1 and i think watching paint dry is much more entertaining what happened to caspar van dien that got him roped into this nightmare terrible acting very boring plot and terrible direction it so terrible it's funny it's suppose to be full of suspense but it more a comedy if you want to see terrible acting ridiculous script writing and sub par plot check this movie out if i was van dien i would not only ask for my 10 from my agent but fire the bastard in the process what a turkey it's not even fit to be on mst 3k it would be a good movie to cure you insomnia i especially love the part where van dien is throw overboard and then makes it back in just a few minutes i can only image that this was written by non union writers taking advantage of the writer's strike what a horrible movie
<START> hip erotic wickedly sexy whatever it's the terminator with werewolves br br no seriously the cop saves the girl waitress from the big monster and refers to himself as her 'protector' the lead actor ryan alosio does a pretty good job of emulating kyle reese there's a massacre in a police precinct the bad guy is muscular with red eyes and it even contains dialogue along the lines of you said it yourself he won't ever stop never the dire script comes from a first time screenwriter who thank god hasn't sold anything since this and it's all thrown together by famously bad director richard friedman br br the movie opens in a strip bar always a good sign and a mean looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason pursued by three cops one of them is black and shock horror he's the one who gets killed in the first five minutes the film goes downhill for the next hour or so then picks up a little with some decent action sequences before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending br br for the most part the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who's willing to settle for less if nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and alosio along with some of the supporting cast shows signs of talent darkwolf in his human form is played by gargantuan kane hodder famous for his numerous portrayals of jason vorhees in the 'friday the 13th' movies he's decent enough especially considering he isn't used to speaking roles br br it's become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between andrea bogart and sasha williams who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former 'power rangers' actresses and it's unnervingly clear that the editor spent way too much time on that scene anyway the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good and the design of the wolf isn't bad at all but the cgi is bad just plain bad i mean seriously if you can't reach some level of realism why bother just throw a little extra money into the make up aside from the terrible script this movie does have it's moments many of which are unintentionally funny it's good for a laugh if you don't have anything better to do but just don't spend any money on it please
<START> this movie should have never been made br br what a shame of the budget br br please hire convincing actors and make a proper movie very thin plot and unconvincing lines almost hilarious and that is a shame for an action movie br br definitely not worth watching br br they keep replaying the same shots of an stealth airplane flying away you have seen it ones and that was not worth re running 3 or 4 times br br it is time for steven seagal to retire from movie making br br his movies are getting worser every time br br black dawn and submerged were already bad but this movie is even worse
