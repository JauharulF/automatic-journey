<START> i reached the end of this and i was almost shouting no no no no it cannot end here there are too many unanswered questions the engagement of the dishwashers mona's disappearance helmer's comeuppance the zombie was little brother saved by his father and what about the head argh then i read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and i have to say i know it probably wouldn't be true to lars von trier's vision but i would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned granted it would be hard to find someone to play helmer as the character deserves helmer the doctor you love to hate i think i have yet to see a more self absorbed oblivious self righteous character on screen but i could overlook a change in actors i just have to know how it ends
<START> 1993 was the year this was long before phillip seymour thomas had won an oscar who knew i would be an extra in a movie with him i was actually a paid extra in my boyfriend's back which was shot in a suburb of austin called georgetown tx the original title was johnny zombie thank god the producers had a change of heart i was in the theater scene i rushed out to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters it is more of a comedy than a horror movie but for a good laugh you might want to check it out nothing that is even close to dawn of the dead or even shaun of the dead quality but the cheese factor is good enough ciao
<START> it's easy to forget once later series had developed the alien conspiracy plot arc more that once upon a time the x files' wrote episodes like genderbender and fearful symmetry where the aliens weren't all little grey men or mind control goop but could actually surprise you br br fearful symmetry starts with an invisible elephant actually an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time not a mile away from the walk and ends with a pregnant gorilla being abducted and it's very much an episode of wonderful moments the subplot is annoyingly worthy yeah we get it zoos are bad except when they're not but the ideas that within it are fascinating visually powerful and very memorable and it covers an angle on abduction that is largely overlooked why would humans be the only things that aliens are interested in br br in the end it wasn't an instant classic but it was enjoyable viewing while it lasted again very memorable and mainly it's something that you couldn't imagine many other shows doing
<START> horrible ending and i can't believe moore spent a year coming up with it smacks of l ron hubbard and dianetitcs which hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks this was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first 3 5 years now the first 1 5 hours were action packed though absurd in the premise and then it deteriorated into a slow painful sophomoric dissolution of the series unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was were we to think more deeply if i wanted a lesson in a materialism i would reread daniel quinn's ishmael absurd to think 38k people would give up everything for a fresh start absurd to throw in a disappearing kara and a reappearing baltar and six absurd to throw in the mitochondrial eve just absurd
<START> i caught this film at a test screening was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story well acted natasha henstridge is the next julia roberts the male lead was awsome very funny film takes place in the best locations in new york made me want to go there i just saw you've got mail i thought it had to be you' was a much better story fresher br br it was clean and great for whole family i think it will do well audience i saw it with loved it a definite recommend
<START> i have nothing against religious movies religious people need something to watch on a saturday night i guess but what really ticks me off is when the write up on the dvd box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer passing off religious propaganda as entertainment is not cool bro br br and even if i was a religious person i would have to agree with most of the other posters here this movie was a mess poorly directed poorly acted poorly edited and the attempt at a soundtrack was hilarious the fake accents were terrible the characters were mainly stereotypes and continuity was out the window the only reason we sat through this lame waste of time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead should have just gone to bed br br absolutely no redeeming qualities to this movie unless you are the religious type who will immediately endorse anything that will preach your beliefs to the unbelievers even if it's a pile of garbage if you aren't avoid this at all costs do not be deceived by the box write up
<START> ok i didn't know what to expect when i saw the cover to fido honestly when i came across it in the video store i was tempted to rent this movie but nothing about it really grabbed my attention but when i was looking around in netflix they were advertising this like crazy if i liked goofy scary movies so i figured to just give it a shot i'm so glad that i did watch it this was just a great movie it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch like i said it's pleasantville meets night of the living dead it's just a great concept what does happen after a mega zombie attack as we see in another zombie comedy shaun of the dead they have fun by making the zombies left over as handy citizens this is a very overlooked horror comedy movie i think a lot of people were just so blown away with shaun of the dead that this got the boot but it's a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie br br in a 1950s alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies this radiation still plagues humanity as all those who die after the original contamination turn into the undead in order to continue living normal lives communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named zomcon zomcon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies' hunger for flesh so as to use them as slaves or servants in the town of willard a housewife helen buys a zombie in spite of her husband bill's zombie phobia their son timmy befriends the zombie naming him fido one day fido's collar malfunctions and he kills their next door neighbor who turns into a zombie timmy kills the zombified neighbor when a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor they capture fido and timmy helen comes and rescues timmy and fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing several days later the neighbor's body is found and the murder is traced back to fido who is taken away to zomcon where the public is told he will be destroyed timmy learns through a friend that fido is simply working in a factory at zomcon timmy sets out to rescue him with the help from his neighbor with a zombie girlfriend in hopes to get fido back br br i really do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it it's so silly but a lot of fun billy connelly did a great job as fido and really brought no pun intended a lot of life into the character i think the scene that made me laugh the most was when timmy has to burry the old lady that fido attacked and killed his last words to her were so funny you weren't really nice but you liked flowers soÂ and he buries her in the garden not to mention the neighbor with the zombie girlfriend sick disturbing wrong but classic laughs i still love how even though this is like the leave it to beaver esquire type of world there still is a lot of gore in the movie so if you do have a chance to see fido take it i promise some good laughs br br 9 10
<START> this horror movie is really weak that is if this is the correct movie i am commenting on nothing really terrible goes on as a family adopts a cute little german shepard pup i had a german shepard and it is a really good dog i did not get the idea to get one from this movie though but rather from the comedy k 9 that is another story all together though this movie really doesn't have much horror at all as the most horrific scene is at the end and it looks really cheesy also we see a guy almost put his hand into a lawn mower that is about it the father suspects something though as his family seems to be getting rather strange somewhere he finds out if you hold a mirror to them while they are sleeping you can see if they are possessed all in all a really weak horror movie even by television standards television movies that do work are out there as this house possessed is pretty good and there is another haunted house movie about a woman and these strange creatures that is also rather good this one is really rather dull
<START> in the world of old school kung fu movies where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen it took a lot for a film to stand out and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years what is arguably chang cheh's finest movie continues to hold influence over the hong kong movie industry from the themes of loyalty brotherhood and revenge as explored by john woo who got his start in the hk movie industry working for chang during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late 1980's to more modern movies like a man called hero which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film the influence has also carried into other areas as well from music such as the wu tang clan tv commercials for sprite and video games such as mortal kombat so what makes this movie so special the plot on the surface is pretty simple it deals with members of a rogue group known as the poison clan who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu all of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities denoted by their animal styles or venoms the lizard can climb walls the scorpion has a deadly strike etc the twist is that since the clan always wears masks not all of them known who the others are thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller we're not talking the usual suspects here but it's far above many other kung fu movies of the time supposedly golden harvest was not too happy with chang's script like most of his movies they felt it was too dark and violent and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it thankfully chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time if not ever completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequences br br but what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves chang cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast not only did he gain talented martial artists whose moves competed without the aid of wires or other special effects put most modern martial artists to shame but great actors as well the formula proved so popular that chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies getting back to matters at hand in most old school movies the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts but here the actors actually create characters it seems that everyone has a favorite venom mine is philip kwok best known to many as mad dog from hard boiled as lizard and it is this personal connection to the characters that the five deadly venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre even if you're normally not a fan of old school movies you need to check the five deadly venoms out if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from
<START> i don't really post comments but wanted to make sure to warn people off this film it's an unfinished student film with no redeeming features whatsoever on a technical level it's completely amateur constant unintentional jump edits within scenes dubbing wildly off etc the plot is completely clichÃ©d the structure is laughable and the acting is embarrassing i don't want to be too harsh i've made my share of student films and they were all awful but there's no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see it br br safe assumption that much like the cast positive comments are filmmakers friends and family
<START> i loved this show so much and i'm so incredibly sad its canceled i thought it came back too but just two stupid weeks thats terrible i hate how we never find out how everyone ends up it sucks bring it back abc has stupid shows like supernanny and whatnot but doesn't give time to good ones like six degrees if they're complaining about ratings it was probably because they had a bad slot because this was truly a good show something i could relate to and anticipated jj abrams delivered he's awesome i wish abc could just trust him enough to complete the story i loved the entire cast too i couldn't wait to see how everyone would someday meet each other at once everyone's story is now left incomplete now i'll never know if steven and whitney would get together or carlos and mae i wanted to see what would happen to laura or damien and everyone else this is really such a downer
<START> it makes the actors in hollyoaks look like the royal shakespeare company this movie is jaw dropping in how appalling it is turning the dvd player off was not a sufficient course of action i want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them around the face i will never get that time back never how is it possible to create such a banal boring and soulless film i could not think of a course of action that would relieve the tedium writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a disgraceful piece of cinema what more can you say than reiterate how truly awful the acting is please avoid
<START> footlight parade is among the best of the 1930's musical comedy extravaganzas a snappy script and an all star cast including jimmy cagney the lovely joan blondell dick powell and ruby keeler make this film a cut above the rest directed and choreographed by the creative genius busby berkeley this film will have you grinning from ear to ear from start to finish br br busby of course is the undisputed master of the hollywood musical with gold diggers of 1933 and 42nd street to his credit as dance director footlight parade is graced by hundreds of scantily clad chorus girls a berkeley trademark the elaborate dance numbers were shot with only one camera and busby was the first director to film close ups of the dancers his obsession with shapely legs and rear view shots is amply demonstrated here the overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing br br our boy jimmy cagney plays chester kent a producer of prologues or short musical stage productions that were performed in movie theaters to entertain the audience before the talkies were shown he's surrounded by crooked partners a corporate spy and a gold digging girlfriend although cagney had a solid background in vaudeville this was the first film in which he showed his dancing talents joan blondell is memorable as cagney's wise cracking lovestruck secretary and ruby keeler is adorable as always br br the film climaxes with three outstanding production numbers honeymoon hotel the waterfall and shanghai lil each one a masterpiece and not likely to be duplicated in today's hollywood where so called special effects have replaced creative cinematography br br claudia's bottom line clever and erotic with some of the best musical production numbers ever put on celluloid a thoroughly enjoyable depression era romp
<START> basically cruel intentions 2 is cruel intentions 1 again only poorly done the story is exactly the same as the first one even some of the lines with only a few exceptions the cast is more unknown and definitely less talented instead of being seductive and drawing me into watching it i ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching a soft core porn i'm not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or the writers and i always feel bad saying that because i know how hard it is to do both but it was basically a two hour waste of my life it literally amazes me that some movies get made and this is no exception i can't believe they'd make a third one
<START> end of the world is an uneventful movie which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth the main character is some kind of scientist i'm not exactly sure what kind he has two jobs at a government facility guarded by four security men his first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job 2 job 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room at least that's the best i can figure apparently the plant is not exactly top secret as the scientist brings his wife there she hangs out they're on their way to a dinner while he discovers a message from space major earth disruption repeated over and over he says something about it being the first message from space he's ever been able to decipher his wife tells him they're going to be late for the dinner party so they leave and go to the party moments later he finds out that china has suffered a major earthquake from there the movie goes nowhere yes christopher lee is in it but that really doesn't help much besides lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in howling ii this movie is boring but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like christopher lee or z grade sci fi plus there's lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed
<START> slight spoilers br br way back before evangelion was made before hideaki anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans and before gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite gunbuster was made with only wings of honneamise made by gainax at that time and the famous otakon shorts or course gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up it didn't make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before space opera br br luckily gainax decided to put it out as a six part oav direct to video series this allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film this also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way besides that they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in macross or gundam and many other popular space operas br br for one the shows starts out pretty light with noriko in the okinawa high school for mechapiloting noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle when she was still a little kid this makes her life at the academy quite hard as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that noriko is favored by the professors the first episode is pretty much a comedy drama with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced and noriko and kazumi best girl in class are chosen to help the assembled fleet out br br the middle bulk of gunbuster leaves our female lead in space focusing on both personal drama and action a couple more characters are introduced and parts of noriko's past are dragged up again besides that the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute and the gunbuster mankind's final hope is presented smart as writer okada was he incorporated the principles of time dilation to spice things up a bit in short time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light this means that noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated when noriko sees her friends again on her return to base who have aged considerably more than her the science might not be perfect but it's presented in a pretty believable way with even some sd science theatre shorts in between the episodes where noriko kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series br br the animation for a series made in the 80s is definitely good the designs are retro 80s style of course but it has it's charm animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice although the costumes do betray br br some of the fanservice fascination gainax will later exploit to the fullest the mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too with the gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine strong and vast the last episode was entirely done in black and white while it's generally believed but not confirmed that this was done for budget reasons it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series which is suited perfectly for the latter part br br the music is very typical space opera fair too bombastic in places very generic and definitely not worth buying it does fit the series for the most part but it can become quite annoying at times tanaka is not really a famous composer and the only other respectable series he's worked on is dragon half if you think 80s anime music you will know what to expect br br as the series progresses the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this step by step the drama will be toned down and the battles will take the front row neither aspect is ever left completely out though with the last episode in sight noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind and with the last battle in sight certain questions are presented to the audience concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy and how far it can go to guarantee self preservation while they are never answered later on they still present some interesting food for thought the last episode is very epic with a nice but quite predictable ending though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course again it fits the series br br gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first with alien invasions huge battles and some personal drama and for the bigger part it is but it is done exceptionally well for a change instead of going for a steady mix of former elements six episodes long gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed out characters which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon the show is very tightly written although it does tend to slip up at some points overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided overall the trip gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed sometimes sad sometimes heroic one it might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre but at least it bend them a little highly enjoyable anime classic but not without flaws br br
<START> this film evil breed the legend of samhain contains very little thought or effort it is ridiculed with specs of ultra fast slasher style death and plain disgusting acts of death the acting was rated a d as the actors show very little ability and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable the way they portrayed what people their ages act like was incredibly different the odd split of porn is fit in thought it really doesn't offer much and any area that is respectable but is quite quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death example is the poor fellow whom is disemboweled from his anus and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes it is terribly obvious of how little of a fight the kids put up this film is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some awful deaths and practically torture
<START> this is an ok adaptation but not as good as the tv version the actors are generally alright but i found jeremy northam rather wet as mr knightley particularly compared to mark strong in the tv version gwyneth paltrow is ok and her english accent is pretty good but again i preferred kate beckinsale's emma there are excellent support performances from toni collette juliet stephenson and sophy thompson br br the script is often played too much for laughs the book is a comedy but there are too many set piece gags here and also the frank churchill subplot is almost completely absent br br my biggest criticism is the scenery it is far too lush england has never been like this it looks like a chocolate box only americans would make it like this br br despite these criticisms i enjoyed this film but would recommend the tv adaptation more
<START> this movie i have been dying to see well it took till now to decide to actually rent it it was completely worth it this movie made me laugh from the beginning to the end chris rock is funny no matter which movie he is in however this should come real close to being his greatest if ur lookin for a family movie ie pre teens and up then this is one u can't pass over
<START> this is what i was expecting when star trek ds9 premiered not to slight ds9 that was a wonderful show in it's own right however it never really gave the fans more of what they wanted enterprise is that show while having a similarity to the original trek it differs enough to be original in it's own ways it makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again and that was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved another ingredient to success was the relationships that evolved between the crew members viewers really cared deeply for the crew enterprise has much promise in this area as well the chemistry between bakula and blalock seems very promising while sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch i feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical i think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even we get some very interesting ideas and television also we should note the performances blalock is very convincing as vulcan t'pol and bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character that delivers a great performance the rest of the cast delivered good performances also my only gripes are as follows the theme it's good it's different but a little to light hearted for my liking we need something a little more grand doesn't have to be orchestral maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice and my one other complaint they sell too many adds they could fix this by selling less ads or making all shows two parters otherwise we'll end up seeing the shows final act getting wrapped up way too quickly as was one of my complaints of voyager
