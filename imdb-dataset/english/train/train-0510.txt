<START> i'll be honest the only reason i watched this one on tv is that it's in the imdb bottom 100 and right now i'm wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another 'check' on that same list br br van damme is luc deveraux who finds himself on a huge fight with the universal soldiers after the main computer pulled a 'hal' to defend itself and yes after all the obligate explosions shoot outs and chases he is the last one standing combined with terrible acting and a bit of a boring set up it makes sure it's place in the infamous list is just br br only for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list 2 10
<START> an art house maven's dream overrated overpraised overdone a pretentious melange that not only did not deserve best picture of 1951 on its own merits it was dwarfed by the competition from the start place in the sun detective story streetcar named desire abbott and costello meet the invisible man you name it if it came out in '51 it's better than this arthouse crapola the closing ballet is claptrap for the intellectual crowd out of place and in the wrong movie few actors in their time were less capable at acting or less charismatic than kelly and caron my 12 worst of '51 i saw 201 movies and among the 5 worst best picture oscar winners
<START> i show this film to university students in speech and media law because its lessons are timeless why speaking out against injustice is important and can bring about the changes sought by the oppressed why freedom of the press and freedom of speech are essential to democracy this is a must see story of how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through the activism of steven biko and the journalism of donald woods it also gives an important lesson of free speech you can blow out a candle but you can't blow out a fire once the flame begins to catch the wind will blow it higher from biko by peter gabriel on shaking the tree
<START> this self proclaimed very talented artist have directed easily the worst spanish film of the 21st century lack of emotion coherence rhythm skills humor it repeats the same situation over and over again it shows no character development it does not even show any violent and or sexual content and it does not add anything new to the psycho killer sub genre so lame it should be shown at film schools as an example of what not to do in a first movie br br btw where the hell is the talent there are scenes which have been shot almost identically there are scenes which have two or more master shots and it is quite awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason the camera almost never moves as if the very talented artist was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills the actors playing the main roles act like amateurs and the supporting cast is hardly believable there are more holes than plot in the script if ever there was one br br a really disheartening movie and a whatsoever talented director
<START> i'm a fan of both shakespeare and mst3k so i waited anxiously to see this episode i'll comment on the movie first then the mst3k episode the recipe for this movie take talented actors rich and beautiful shakespeare material and a 1 25 budget mix well then drain of all life and movement until dull and lifeless serve cold in a big plain stone cauldron movie i give 3 out of 10 because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit okay now the mst3k episode i'll admit it the first time i saw it i fell asleep halfway through i understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well however when i watched it a second time i realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines i missed the first time around the trick with this episode is listen carefully it takes a couple of viewings to catch each line give it a second chance and you'll see what i mean mst3k episode 7 1 2 out of 10
<START> very silly movie filled with stupid one liners and jewish references thru out it was a serious movie but could not be taken seriously a familiar movie plot being at the wrong place at the wrong time an atrocious subplot involving kim bassinger very robotic and too regimented i have noticed that al pacinos acting abilities seem to be going downhill a troubleshooter with troubles but nothing more troubling than pacinos horrible atlanta accent damage control needs to fix this damage of a film ok my one liners are bad but not as bad as the ones in this film this movie manages to not only be boring but revolting as well usually a revolting film is watchable for the wrong reasons this movie is unwatchable i did manage to sit through this the plot if written a tad bit better with perhaps a little better acting and eliminating the horrendous subplot and even dumber jokes could have pulled this thriller out of the doldrums what we are left with is a dull silly movie that made sure it was drilled into our heads that eli wurman was jewish an embarrassment to all the good jewish folk everywhere
<START> this picture in 1935 walked away with all kinds of ocars for best director john ford actor victor mclaglen and music by max seiner victor mclaglen gypo nolan call out the marines '42 gave an outstanding performance as an irish rebel who belonged to a rough and tough crowd who were all fighting for a cause and at the same time getting poorer and poorer with plenty of drinking gypo nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informer for his best friend in order to take a trip with his gal to america and a new way of living preston foster don gallagher guadalcanal diary '43 gave a great supporting role as the leader of the irish rebellion and was anxious to capture the informer of his group gypo nolan becomes haunted by his betrayal of his friend and begins to feel just like a judas great film for 1935 and wonderful acting by mclaglen but rather depressing in every aspect of the film
<START> i give this a generous four out of ten stars or dots or markers or something br br there were a grand total of two really really funny scenes in this movie all the scenes with amy p and tina fey and greg kinnear greg kinnear moved along agreeably enough br br otherwise the usual trafficking in stereotypes blazing speed rudely pushed along by a stupid soundtrack and soundtrack is generous br br anyway the two really really funny scenes involved amy p she's just really hilarious in an animal kind of way she's a mixture of that ape man skit that they do on snl and lucille ball br br i hope they amy p and tina fey just flat out admitted they did this for the money because if by doing it it gave birth to the sarah palin parodies then i guess we can say yeah it was worth it to put the black guy back into the servant man role who's really there to help you be more human br br blah 4 outta 10 like i said is generous br br but no more girls ok oh i almost forgot the mom from two and a half men is in this movie and she's had some kind of plastic surgery so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30 year old so every scene she's in i'm like trying to rearrange her face or put it together in my mind or just answer the question no wait wait has she had plastic surgery because as a viewer you really don't want her to have had plastic surgery
<START> les convoyeurs attendent was the first film i saw in 2000 and i doubt i'll see a better one this year this beautiful tragicomedy by belgian filmmaker benoÃ®t mariage is set in the industrial wastelands of wallonia benoÃ®t poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car a lada for him to do this the son has to break the record opening doors what the father actually wants his for his son to be someone because he himself has never made it further as the reporter of local news for a newspaper ironically called l'espoir hope of course nothing works out as planned this film can best be compared to aki kaurismÃ¤ki's drifting clouds although it is more dramatic and the humour is darker just like in that film however the tone is more melancholic than depressing and the ending upbeat without being unrealistically happy the humour is absurd without making the plot unbelievable and mariage finds stunning images in the bleak settings that never seem artificial the best thing about les convoyeurs attendent is the acting by poelvoorde this actor shot to fame with the also brilliant cult classic c'est arrivÃ prÃs de chez vous in which he played the charismatic hitman ben since then he only played two small roles in films that were not released in the netherlands because as he said in an interview he was not convinced of his own acting capabilities and all the roles he was offered were reprises of the ben character with his return to a leading role in lca there should be no doubt anymore about his acting he's simply brilliant as a man stupid and evil enough to put his family in misery but smart enough to realize what he's done and be torn by remorse about it a must see
<START> set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of willard in the 1950s this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such american obsessions as gun mania and violence materialism and keeping up with the joneses fear of others slavery golf and the disposing of the dead yes it all sounds a bit heavy but trust me on this it's nearly as light as a feather br br zombies are featured prominently among the characters crucial questions arise such as who will become a zombie 90 of the willard folks choose this final path while only 10 prefer a traditional funeral who owns how many zombies to do their bidding like robots they've become a mark of social status and what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead br br somehow director andrew currie who also co wrote the lively screenplay with robert chomiak and dennis heaton keeps this improbable material percolating along for an hour and a half without once faltering for want of a good laugh a super cast helps carrie anne moss billy connolly dylan baker henry czerny tim blake nelson mary black and sonja bennett are the principals aided by young k'sun ray as timmy the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups having seen her only in memento and the matrix i had no idea that ms moss had such fine comedienne chops br br the production design and music are exquisitely 50s to a tee maybe this one isn't for everybody it surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual bizarro award but intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie making for me anyway fido is a hoot my grades 8 5 10 a seen on 01 30 07
<START> i wish i could say that this show was unusual in it's banality but it is usual in every way it has the dumb husband his smarter but boring and conventional wife along with the idiotic sidekick for comic relief it sorely needs it stale predictable jokes with even more predictable reactions from the laughtrack punctuate this noxious mental narcotic's nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma but it might be on for a while yet because it gives the average american a personage to which they can truly identify a regular guy just like you and me i live in the southern u s so to me this show is just the opposite of escapism down here that obnoxious character is everywhere in some form or another seeing him on television is brutal overkill
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br this second instalment of the che films moves the story forward to the late 60s where the man has now moved his resistance fighters into the hills of south america surviving without enough food and water and with tensions mounting between the group everything comes to a head when he crosses the border into bolivia and the government forces step up their campaign to bring him down br br without the flitting between time and places of the last film soderbergh's second instalment focuses solely on the action in the hills and manages to be an even duller experience and more pretentiously the score has been drowned out giving the second instalment more of an unwelcome air of artsieness that proves just as alienating there's just an unshakeable air of boredom to the film that never lets up you can't fault soderbergh's ambition or del toro's drive in the lead role it's just a shame that somewhere in the production things managed to take such a disappointing turn
<START> after some difficulty johnny yuma arrives at his ailing uncle's ranch to take over day to day operations only to find out that the old man has been murdered by his beautiful gold digger wife and the woman's vicious brother br br good production values a likable performance by mark damon and a breezy action packed script combine to make this an entertaining if not exceptionally deep above average addition to the spaghetti western genre br br co star rosalba neri is one of the hottest european babes ever to grace the screen here she's absolutely perfect as the cold hearted user and abuser of weak men br br damon and neri appeared together in at least one other picture the devil's wedding night a pretty good horror movie that's of particular interest for those of you that want to see what's underneath rosalba's dresses
<START> br br what can i say this is one of the most perfect films ever made its a throwback to the glitxy sterling romantic comedies of the 1940s but with a modern touch the screenplay bursts with wit charm humor and tenderness the cinematograpy is breathtaking nyc never looked so beautiful and of course there is the cast dudley moore turns in the performance of his career as loveable drunken arthur bach he is also wistful and real one of the film's best lines is his poignant not everyone who drinks is a poet some of us drink because we're not poets the great sir john gielgud won a much deserved oscar for his splendid performance as hobson arthur's valet and caretaker although he considered it a take the money and run role he brings to the character all the talent experience and bravura of an expert tragidian and a sly comedian the supporting cast is also out of thisworld from geraldine fitzgerald's sassy grandma bach to stephen elliott's bombastic mafioso br br the score is also extremely memorable and compliments the film perfectly the only real problem with the film is the ill fated sequel it spawned
<START> i'm sorry to say that there isn't really any way in my opinion that an enzo would really be able to keep up with a saleen s7 twin turbo the power to weight advantage possessed by the s7 would just be too great the s7 has a power weight ratio of 3 93 lbs hp while the enzo has 4 61 lbs hp the s7s low end is much better too sorry ferrari fans but the saleen just gets it done so much better br br as for other parts of this film i just have to say it's so substandard as to be pathetic the story is way too weak the acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soaps br br i can say that as far as it being a treatise on negative psychology its kind of a gem this film is nothing if not a glaring definition as to what narcissism and sociopathy are all about its all about these rich punks getting their rocks off while showing only traces of feigned remorse for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death too br br i can't give the film a 1 star rating because it didn't compel me to actually walk out of the theater i also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the leading female saves it from being completely abysmal although there is no way her singing would put her on the cover of 'variety' br br ps the guy who plays jason is sooooo the skid row version of james vanderbeek
<START> petter mattei's love in the time of money is a visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter br br this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler's play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat br br the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter br br the acting is good under mr mattei's direction steve buscemi rosario dawson carol kane michael imperioli adrian grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive br br we wish mr mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work
<START> a well put together entry in the serial killer genre that unfortunately gets mired down in its own pretentiousness to be really satisfying willem dafoe is superb as a nyc detective trying to track down what appears to be a copycat using the same renaissance art related killing techniques used in a series of murders he solved years earlier scott speedman is dafoe's junior partner and they have pretty good chemistry at least for a while other characters pop up to conveniently tie the two cases together clea duval is the friend of an earlier victim and peter stormare is some sort of art broker mentor to dafoe that's a bit hard to take although stormare is of course never dull the film's ending is particularly disappointing look fast for deborah harry as dafoe's less than forthcoming neighbor
<START> it's a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly if only in comparison to other films in its legacy and others in a 'sub plot' or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong sudden impact is one of those cases where clint eastwood as star producer director shows when he can be at his best or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crime mystery detective story in his dirty harry fame we get that 'make my day' line and un like in the first film where his 'do i feel lucky' speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails here it's switched around he gets into another shamble with the department as usual when he tries to fight crime 'his' way in particular with a diner robbery inspiration for pulp fiction and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus he's told to 'take a vacation' and that's the last thing on his mind this whole main plot isn't very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines which just adds to the frustration but soon his story merges with the sub plot that eastwood develops from the start br br enter sandra locke's character jennifer spencer whom we soon learn after some appropriately mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel unjust sexual assault err outright rape and is sleekly undercover like getting revenge her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film the most intense and finally when it goes into callahan's storyline he's getting facts in the same small town she's in on a murder the film finally finds a focus between eastwood's classic form of clearly defined good vs evil though sometimes blurred to be sure eastwood films the flashbacks not to say too much about them expertly in a fresh experimental style the trademark lalo schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others it almost seems like a couple of times an art house sensibility has crept into eastwood's firmly straightforward storytelling style which helps make the film watchable br br it's a shame though that in the end it goes more for the expectable or maybe not expectable points and until the third act callahan doesn't have much to do except his usual 'it's smith wesson and me' shtick however with locke he gets out of her a very good performance more subtle and touching than the one in the gauntlet and an exciting climax at an amusement park in a way i do and don't agree with ebert's remark that it's like a 'music video' in eastwood's style here i admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both the directness but the scenes where eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video it's cheesy it's hard edged it's not up to par with the first two 'harry' pictures but hey there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the 44
<START> the us state dept would not like us to see this movie because they have a beef with the iranian govt however it shows us just how civilized iran really is despite the content of the film which centers on the struggle of women there for equal rights in the simplest of terms the ability to watch a soccer game at the stadium which is strictly limited to male audiences alone the film is hilariously funny and in and of itself is proof of freedom of speech and expression in iran i enjoyed this movie intensely five girls try to penetrate the police border at the ticket gates to a soccer match between iran and bahrain the ensuing comedy is too funny to describe from the bus trip to the stadium to the interceding of the police and subsequent detention of the girls to the resulting end don't miss this classic film its a must see one of the best foreign films i've seen in years
