<START> a riotous farce set in the world of glamorous daytime soap operas this film is hilarious admittedly you have to have a taste for films with screaming hysterical dialogue over the top acting and melodramatic plot twists but if you do you're in for one hell of a treat br br sally field plays celeste talbert daytime tv's queen of misery celeste's cushy life is thrown into upheaval with the unexpected arrival of lori craven elisabeth shue her long lost niece and simultaneously jeffrey anderson kevin kline splendid as always celeste's long ago lover but celeste has been hiding a deep dark secret and the arrival of lori and jeffrey might just bring it to the surface add in the diabolical montana moorehead a wonderful cathy moriarty in full gorgeous woman with testosterone to spare mode who is trying mighty hard to destroy celeste's career david robert downey jr the weenie boy producer of the soap who's secretly plotting with montana to ruin celeste and rose schwarz whoopi goldberg scriptwriter and celeste's one true confidant and you are in for a heaping helping of subplots and general chaos br br chaotic comedies like this are tricky to execute does anyone remember 'mixed nuts' but when done well can be pretty damn funny a major ingredient that is necessary to any good comedy is the casting of seasoned pros who know that lots of times the funniest things are not said but seen in an expression or a look field kline goldberg and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm shue is clearly the weakest link here but she only draws attention to herself because she is surrounded by field kline et al moriarty is a stand out in the showy villainess role making you think of the hottest damn dominatrix you ever did see there are also lots of familiar faces that you'll recognize in small but nevertheless all very funny roles including carrie fisher garry marshall kathy najimy and teri hatcher director michael hoffman keeps the pace swift and the histrionic plot moving toward the big finish mention must also be made of robert harling's screenplay carefully constructed to stage a soap opera within a soap opera the dialogue is boiling over with great lines delivered brilliantly by the actors i'd be willing to bet that a lot of this stuff was improvised br br look if you want to see a bunch of pros doing what they do best and having a great time doing it get your hands on this one if not for anything else it will put you in a good mood and make you laugh

<START> did francis ford coppola have a brain aneurysm some time after directing apocalypse now that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie br br you have to wonder what the director of the godfather and the conversation was thinking when he made this flabby film it gives kathleen turner a starring vehicle playing a woman who travels back in time and gets to redo her adolescence knowing all of the things that life as an adult has taught her and turner the trooper that she is does what she can with it but this movie couldn't be saved by anyone br br it doesn't even have any style to it and given its director one would expect that even if it had nothing else it would have that br br grade c
<START> this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen everything about it is weak and incoherent the acting is absurd the costumes even crummier and the story is non existent this 'poverty row' sword and adventure film was meant to capture some of the success that beastmaster and conan enjoyed but it doesn't give us any reason to follow along the lead character is tepid and dull he can't even fight with a sword and the sword is from the 16th century all the action sequences are like that slow and unrealistic not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music playing whenever they are riding a horse don't even bother with this crap
<START> a confused mess from start to finish like they used to say about the beatles'songs there was a secret message if you played the lp backward if one had the patience to watch this films scenes from finish to start you'd come away with the same degree of disappointment br br apart from all of this psychedelic hodge podge of flashbacks and false starts the clearest characters were the movie backers out for revenge if the movie didn't get sorted there was nothing to like about these two either overacting shouting and threats were delivered in comic book fashion i think one dimensional was an overstatement br br okay so maybe the artsy types are rolling their eyes reveling in the fact that unlike them we plebeians just didn't get it well i'm afraid there was nothing to get and the two cardinal sins of any bad movie carried from start to finish a non existent and pathetic story line if you want to call it that and by far the worst not a single character you cared about in the least
<START> robert wagner is the evil boss of digicron a telecommunications company with a virus that kills people br br 'so you're saying that the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people that may be medically possible but not possible from my system' br br 'i'm having to write some new virus software of my own to trap it it may take some time' br br 'but it's not going after software it's killing people' br br watch out for the 'i'm into virology' love moment and perhaps first ever film plot to feature death by braille keyboard
<START> what a load of rubbish i can't even begin to describe how awful this film was the rating it has here is really hard to believe br br avoid particularly if you enjoyed the first ginger snaps the first one was well written well directed well executed a brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere the second one was 'alrite' decent as a self standing film but clearly not up to the level of the first the third is an insult to the series period i rate the films 10 6 1 it's that bad br br oh and yes it really is set in the past the sisters are still called ginger and b fitzgerald all muddled in with some half assed native american mythology the sisters don't have any real story or progression or even a clear relationship they're just trying to survive and be 'together forever' that's about as deep as it gets br br staggered that the girls agreed to be in this pile of shite after reading the script br br oh and another thing staging of action was terrible people appearing from nowhere regularly like the girls turn around and there's an elaborate candle lit setup with a mystic native american woman just sitting there about to go into a speech sets were terrible couldn't get away from the fact that it was all obviously based in a set which really didn't help also there was consistently snow outside the camp but not a trace inside on the set br br arrghh so bad i really was hoping it would be at least as good as the second one
<START> what the hell is this kooky drama lawyers in loony tunes land the world's thinnest most duck faced actress even more duck faced and anorexic than michelle pfeiffer overacts her bony butt off making cretinous grimaces that would shame bugs bunny in one of the most animated non animated tv series ever this is also the most annoying one hour format tv show ever hence the worst br br all the men act like pansies and i for one refuse to believe that even hip big city shysters are all as delta male like as this sorry short bunch wuss peter macnicol manages to be even more irritating than calista flockofducks with his fake hollywood shshshs speech impediment it's the sort of pseudo inability to pronounce the letter s by turning it into a moronic sh that the likes of jon shtewart and christian shlater also practice with zeal watching macnicol talk i always wonder how come his jaw doesn't dislocate human facial anatomy was never meant to support the pronouncing of the sh sound more than three times per second he is a medical wonder br br this badly conceived and written legal drama comedy hodgepodge also features some very 90s pc it has political correctness written with huge neon letters is there anything more unrealistic than a bunch of lawyers being full of ideals high principles and moral fiber laughable but that's the way defense lawyers have been portrayed in hollywood since its inception after all what is more noble than defending a murderer a rapist or a thief when a tv series as retarded as ally mcbeak starts preaching to america about how it should run the country then it must be time for paris hilton to become president ally mcquack is both a product of recent and large scale western dumbing down and a perpetrator of it br br those supposed touches of eccentricity like the unbelievably annoying musical numbers are unconvincing and embarrassingly unfunny this is no monty python whatever new the talent free makers of this garbage were aiming for they failed with honours ally mcbeak is a highly commercialized tv venture aimed at indiscriminating yuppies bored housewives and bipolar lawyers it's yet another dull objection overruled sustained your honour may i call the witness legalistic baloney that the american audiences seem to eat up with relish for some strange reason
<START> how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up with enough cops to run a mini war that include such weapons as flamethrowers you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying 'thanks' to a corrupt cop br br you will never get your 90ish minutes back life is too precious to rent this movie br br i feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie br br if you like justin timberlake feel free to rent this movie he does have a very major part in it so fans might enjoy seeing him br br however i believe most of his fans are young girls who may be turned off by the violence in this movie
<START> this is one very confusing movie the film is very hard to follow and the plot just didn't seem to make any sense the fury of the wolfman was made in spain and i think that when any film is dubbed from one language to another it doesn't translate exactly as it was first meant maybe this is part of the problem but i doubt if it can account for all the problems with this film the dubbing is pretty bad and the voices don't match the characters very well the scenes are choppy there is an array of strange and irrelevant characters that do little more than confuse the viewer even more what i did like about this film was the look of the wolfman himself and the scenes where he attacks now if they could have put it all together and had it make some sense they might have had something don't waste your time on this one
<START> polish film maker walerian borowczyk's la bÃªte french 1975 aka the beast is among the most controversial and brave films ever made and a very excellent one too this film tells everything that's generally been hidden and denied about our nature and our sexual nature in particular with the symbolism and silence of its images the images may look wild perverse sick or exciting but they are all in relation with the lastly mentioned sex desire and death are very strong and primary things and dominate all the flesh that has a human soul inside it they interest and temptate us so powerfully and by our nature that they are considered scary unacceptable and something too wild to be true br br a sophisticated young woman travels with her mother to a french countryside to meet her soon to become husband whom with she has had a letter affair of some kind all are very exciting and each others' parents and relatives wait impatiently to see the new people arriving to their families the innocence of the young bride shines through and no one knows what can happen and wake up inside the walls of the big and beautiful french mansion with all its humans and animals and a mysterious la bÃªte that turns out to be something that the characters nor most of the film's audience could have never imagined to be real and in front of them br br the film is about the same theme as canadian david cronenberg's debyt feature shivers 1975 which happens inside a huge luxury building in which destructive and gory parasites spread from human to human by sexual contact and make people act furiously and violently in their lust for pleasure and fulfilment of instincts human has instincts that can be and are stronger than his will and that is why those instincts can be as dangerous and powerful as the instincts of some other animal a beast be it a lust for blood revenge or sex and carnal pleasure humans are only animals that have intelligence and tools to convey it but because we are also animals that intelligence is not always used too much as can be seen anywhere around us the film opens greatly and very shockingly for most hypocritic attitudes showing a horny male horse raging in fury as he waits to get inside the mare and continue the race but the rage and visible lust we see from his eyes and violent movements are the key elements of that beginning and why it is there not the close ups of organs as could be so easily claimed the horse is a beast that battles in an almost unbearable heat in heat that's much stronger than his will as he doesn't have any control at that point anymore the power of the instinct makes an animal a beast br br after the memorable beginning the characters get introduced and the film fantastically has all the necessary age groups inside it from the little innocent children waiting to grow up and develop to their blossom to the adults and elders that all represent their own part of the lifespan creating the face of human life on screen a film doesn't necessarily need more characters this way as all the important ones are already there and represent the whole race including the urban and countryside inhabitants and both sexes the mansion makes the protagonist girl's sexuality wake as she saws the horses coupling and acting like she obviously has never thought of for the first time she sees something unique and something that excites and feels almost vital for her and her body like getting water when you're very thirsty the transformation of the girl is a very important element in the film as she has lived unaware of these things inside her with his mother and camera and a letter boyfriend even though the things have just waited for the moment to burst out flesh desires flesh and that belongs to being a humanimal but still those things are not so easily admitted everywhere and films like these trying to depict it get banned for decades man's stupidity and unwillingness to interpret images must not be an argument for a film being banned or otherwise violated br br the film's last 30 minutes are also as important as the beginning and once again show how powerful cinema is without needless words and talk as the girl and audience realizes what her body starts to feel and desire she starts to have dreams about the mysterious beast that turns out to be none other than the undressed form of ourselves having lived in the woods without other people beasts near him the dream sequence is the one that causes and caused most of the controversy alongside the film's overall straight and honest attitude and the images are so easy to be judged as perverse and pornographic without a courage to go deeper into them character reactions and thoughts behind what we see the images are exciting in her dream and also eventually inside the dream for the dream's more human character and borowczyk forces us to admit it with the images that are so close to a normal sexual act between a man and a female which is a beautiful thing and expression of love another human need also the numerous and cleverly blackly humorous love making scenes inside the mansion between the young mother and the black servant get interrupted many times as someone screams for the servant for example and there's no doubt that the sensual image of two young human bodies being together and being interrupted with an angry shout at least doesn't become any more pleasant by the interruption borowczyk has managed to paint his images so beautiful and sensitive that his message is almost impossible to be misunderstood but nothing seems to be impossible for our cultures and minds that criticize art he uses dialogue only when it's necessary otherwise the images do the job and make the film powerful br br death is also there as flesh dies sooner or later after years of life and instincts it dies the ending is inevitable but the meaning of the dream sequence could have also been as powerful without the kind of dramatic and revealing ending too another blackly humorous element comes when we see the shocked city women running out of the place in which they saw a little more than they were looking for they visited the mansion of truth about flesh us and them the film reminds me of french writer georges bataille's story of the eye with its same themes about eroticism death and how they both are always connected to the nature of our flesh the book is well written and fantastic as well as this film and naturally both have been blamed for their too explicit content and other equally noteworthy shallow comments br br borowczyk's film is also very beautiful visually alongside its raw honesty and the nature and forest have rarely looked so bright and shining as they do in this film the sun shines through the trees and to everyplace where humans live and the beauty of it is always there but so is the ugliness that originates by the inhabitants of the world to every innocent white sheep there's a selfish evil and horrible beast in our world and that is why the intelligence we have been given never fully seems to overcome the power of our bad instincts and the other side of the sheep present inside every human soul it is about how many manages to keep the dark side passive and not active the fulfilment of some of our instincts is not a bad thing and by using this intelligence and seeing which of the instincts are good and which bad they can be satisfied without exploitation violence and the lethal and destructive circle created by it human is not more than an animal with intelligence intelligence that is so easy to be forgotten and eaten to the background by things that feel better and more satisfying at each and perhaps sudden moment borowczyk's film is a masterpiece unforgettable and clever piece of magical cinema with ageless theme and also an example of how much can be achieved expressed and given by a film maker who is also only a human
<START> with lots of sunshine gauzy light and shadow filtering through windows and into rooms tracking shots moving through crowds with hand held camera quick paced editing and extreme close ups here and there the photography is the thing in this interesting artistically done film br br the plot of this film starts out as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest the film begins on a warm sunday at the local swimming pool where we meet the lovely lucienne aka lulu played by louise brooks a bit of a show off in front of the gawking men by poolside she soon decides to enter herself to represent france in the miss europe beauty contest much to the chagrin of her very jealous stick in the mud fiancÃ© a pretty annoying fellow really strutting down the runway the ten contestants display themselves in swimsuits while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause i was wondering couldn't the girls just walk slower to prolong their length of time and thus applause on the catwalk lulu is soon being chased by a prince and a maharaja but her hot headed beau doesn't like the attentions paid to her by other men or her adoring public for that matter i guess he just wants her in his house cooking his meals and staying out of sight eh br br louise brooks is beautiful and charming her presence helps enhance this film but it's really the way it is photographed that held my interest the most a bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound which is a bit off the print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though watching this i just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually and i found the movie to be excellent well worth seeing
<START> unless the title is supposed to be some kind of spoiler for the wife's transformation the fiends ruining it for us anycase if this movie wasn't made for tv it should have been it's so remarkably low budget underscripted underacted and hits every 70's cliche except disco nobody is likeable and you could careless what happens to anyone in this one eminently forgetable except for the bad bad performances
<START> i just saw this film tiff toronto international film festival fans of hal hartley will not be disappointed and if you are not familiar with this director's oeuvre doesn't matter this film can definitely stand all on its own i have to go the second screening it was amazing i need to see it again and fast br br this film is very funny it's dialogue is very smart and the performance of parker posey is outstanding as she stars in the title role of fay grim fay grim is the latest feature revisiting the world and characters introduced in the film henry fool 2000 visually the most salient stylistic feature employs the habitual use of the canted or dutch angle which can be often seen in past hartley works appearing in various shorts available in the possible films short works by hal hartley 1994 2004 collection and in the girl from monday 2005 br br i viewed this film most aptly on sept 11th textually fay grim's adventure in this story is backdropped against the changed world after september 11 2001 without going into major spoilers i view this work and story world as a bravely political and original portrait of geo politics that is rarely if ever foregrounded in mainstream fictional cinema post 911 heretofore cf syrianna of side note mark cuban exec prod in both these films most interesting to say the least br br lastly for those closely attached to the characters of henry fool simone fay and henry this film is hilariously self conscious and self referential that being said the character of fay grimm starts off in the film exactly where she was when henry fool ended but by the end of the film fay's knowledge and experience has total changed and expanded over the course of the narrative what can be in store for the future of fay and the fool family i can't wait for the third part in this story
<START> this will be brief let me first state that i'm agnostic and not exactly crazy about xtians especially xtian fanatics however this documentary had a tone of the like of some teenager angry at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games i just couldn't take it seriously mentioning how charlesmanson thought he was christ to illustrate the point that xtianity can breed evil i don't know it was just cheap and childish made the opposition look ignorant furthermore the narrator just seemed snobby and pretentious the delivery was complete overkill i can't take this documentary seriously might appeal to an angry teenager piss3d off at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games
<START> this movie was promising my favorite actor in a historical drama during the independence war it had memories from dances with wolves for the big prairies indians military fights from barry lyndon for the british candles lights atmospheres br br unfortunately the script is awful the continuity of the story is lacking cuts with 5 months later 3 years later the romance is so ridiculous that it's hard to believe in it america is a big country but the characters kept bumping at each other above all wait for the ending you understand how to kill a story imagine the same in titanic br br sometimes a bad script is saved by a brilliant filmmaker unfortunately bis hudson is a poor one he has already committed greystoke and i find again the same flaws no dynamic in scenes in editing in scoring it is long dull flat br br i knew that this movie was a disaster for pacino's career now i understand finally this last movie for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me a painful one
<START> this is one of them movies that has a awesome video box but has wired camra work and unknown actors that speak with bad dialogue its so dark when the killings happen you can hardly see it plus the movie is hard to understand the only star in this is wcw s vanessa sanchez tygres in wcw before it folded and she is a good actress i like low budget film especialy ones that has errors because they are fun to watch but severed unfourtunatly isn t one of them this movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and severed heads but this is no blockbuster but if you need something new to watch then rent severed
<START> surely one the french films of the decade so far a taut atmospheric thriller making full use of the lead characters hearing impediment to use sound in a way rarely explored in cinema emannuelle devos gives a truly stunning multi faceted performance at times devious and manipulative at other times open and vulnerable another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offerings from france
<START> i may not be a critic but here is what i think of this movie well just watched the movie on cinemax and first of all i just have to say how much i hate the storyline i mean come on what does a snowman scare besides little kids secondly it is pretty gory but i bet since the movie is so low budget they probably used ketchup so my critical vote is bomb nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much
<START> this film is about a japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on skin br br the plot is absolutely bizarre i fail to see any sensual or erotic undertones the plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography in addition the scenes that are filmed in hong kong are certainly portraying bad parts of hong kong such as the airport in the middle of the city poor living conditions and noise pollution throughout the whole film i keep thinking that the pillow book is insulting the japanese culture and the hong kong environment br br the pillow book is a perverted yet boring film seriously stay away from it
