<START> i rented this some years ago the video store had only vhs at the time straight to video was hitting it's strides you know where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films i didn't know what to expect other than what was printed first thing i thought while watching was what the hells' wrong with the sound obviously there was no dialogue dubbing words echoed so i stopped munching on whatever i had to pay closer attention mind you there's no shakespeare here just simple talk the story is simple enough boy meets girl etc what struck me as humorous and heartfelt was the people in the movie didn't seem like caricatures written into the story but rather non actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs uniforms included all the while you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor people hurting their privates using vulgarities this couldn't have hurt the marketing there was something honest about it i thought if they'd have a bigger budget then it would have been better which i'm sure they considered daily but they went ahead and made it this i felt was what independent film making is all about the word indy is thrown around as if it's a genre ha that's funny
<START> this is a classic with so many great dialogs and scenes nobody should miss nice story funny riches to rags situations mel brooks is not a bad lead maybe not perfect but he is funny d don't pay attention to the rating it's bs watch it then watch something like final destination 2009 and tell me that life stinks deserves about the same rating if you do i don't think we can be friends xd at this point i recommend the fourth season of curb your enthusiasm to every brooks fan vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of inchworms i've to make 10 lines here to post a comment i don't wanna write a book here p
<START> i can't believe this is on dvd even less it was available at my local video store br br some argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a 4000 budget i find this funny i would find it very bad whichever the budget br br still more funny i read the following in another review dramatics aside if you love horror and you love something along the lines of duel 1971 updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in you'll love this movie br br what this is a shame comparing those two movies br br i give a 1 since i can't give a 0 i just don't see any way this movie could be entertaining
<START> alright so i've been dying to see this movie stoked about the who's who in horror land that are in the film well my friend rented this brought it over and we started watching it it's supposed to be a comedy i did not smirk even once until the 40min mark br br does it have to do with the budget not at all in fact there's films out there that cost close to absolutely nothing and they're amazing to me anyways also while watching this film i couldn't help but realize the similarities i e stealing to a low budget indie film titled actress apocalypse read my review about it it destroys this film btw br br this film it had potential it really did it had the star power stolen plot lets film the behind the scenes of the making of a movie ie actress apocalypse seriously this angers me the more and more i think about it really could've been funny a lot a lot of the jokes fall flat the acting is alright for what it is but it dragged on wasn't funny and the plot was totally stolen br br i give this a two because it wasn't sooo awful but that's the only reason
<START> i had never read gary paulsen's novel hatchet for which 'a cry in the wild' is the adaptation of so i can't make any comparisons to the book i will however say that as a film on its own adaptation or no adaptation it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters br br think of 'a cry in the wild' as a less luxurious teenage mountaineer was quincy california the only place this was filmed version of 'cast away ' jared rushton is 13 year old brian roebson a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain terrain leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself br br there are basically three parts to the film the obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters namely brian and his mom br br the next third of the movie which really consumes nearly all of the film is that of brian roughing it these scenes contain no particularly amazing action nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful yukon landscape nothing to put you on edge no real encounters except a brisk confrontation with a cub and no major dilemmas to initiate some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen you might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness brian dealing with his situation through first primitive means and then more improved ones using tools etc for his survival it is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation and that is pretty much about it in other words they put no meat on the paulsen's words when they translated them into a visual media br br and of course the third part of the movie is his rescue br br there is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time however some conflict between brian and his parents that created a rocky awkward relationship between them however for the most part it is only explained in brief intermittent minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video any minute the singer from jefferson starship should chime in an start singing 'sara ' other than what the viewer can draw from the implications or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters whether or not it really had anything to do with brian's survival adventure in the third part of the movie these are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a stupor as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and for me almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more br br it certainly was not for me a good adventure tale but for fans of jared rushton it was one of the last few movies he made so watch it purely for nostalgia if nothing else
<START> well on the endless quest for horror we will come across this film apparently re released on dvd recently for some ungodly reason the transfer is awful and the quality just sucks i don't think this is due to a bad remaster or anything i just think the film is poorly done br br obviously filmed at an abandoned school with a budget that was no doubt wasted on cheap beer and no talent hacks slaughter high starts out slow and doesn't pick up pace until about an hour in first we get to see a 'nerd' as he is picked on by a group of i actually don't even know what they were supposed to be jocks the ringleader with his ultra hooknose is so ugly he should have definitely been cast as the nerd then there is a 'big guy' and a couple of dumb losers and chicks who are supposed to be 'hot' but aren't it's a mystery why this group of rejects is picking on one of their own but i guess the viewer is to assume these are 'cool kids' picking on a dweeb the casting choices are horrendous as most of the high schoolers are played by thirty somethings as other reviewers on here have pointed out the actors if you can call them that are a bunch of brits whose accents slip out numerous times throughout this piece of crap we are left to assume that this group of 'children' were the only students at this school as their 'reunion' is only them at the school which is now shown to be abandoned is just them br br the kills are lame the gore is not great and the script is like scooby doo with real people lines like 'this place gives me the creeps ' and 'someone gimme a beer' are highlights it's just not good skip this one unless you are getting wasted with some friends and wanna laugh at a real lame attempt at a slasher if you wanna see good get bava's bay of blood done 14 years earlier and a heck of a lot better if you wanna see a good bad slasher see just before dawn or the burning 2 out of 10 kids
<START> i nominate this and babylon 5 as the best television sci fi series made both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters if you look at the original star trek and star trek tng they were fine shows but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes in many ways you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring this was less the case with deep space 9 with its giant battles that took up all of the final season and the other trek shows as there was more of a larger story that unified them this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with sg 1 the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form sure there were a few throwaway episodes that were not connected to the rest but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny br br and speaking of funny i loved that sg 1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious in this way i actually enjoyed it more than babylon 5 jack o'neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons br br to truly appreciate sg 1 you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power and if you don't like sg 1 after giving it a fair chance then sci fi is probably not the genre for you
<START> if you are planning to rent or buy this movie don't it's the worst thing i have ever seen i would comment on it more but it has been 10 years since i saw it and have blanked all of it from my mind save yourself some time money and well being and stay far far away
<START> the documentary revolves around eva mozes kor a holocaust survivor part of mengele's experiments on twins consisting primarily her version of what happened at auschwitz and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments the movie obviously had great reviews it's one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about br br i too for a large part of the movie got sucked into the emotion that the movie maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on one of the user reviews on imdb by eric monder obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum could only find the sweetest nectar in one of the many dramatic sequences as a group of jews argue with kor at a jewish center the meaning of the word forgive is even debated but the isolated and outnumbered kor holds her own but by this time the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that i could see clearly once more after the strong willed eva kor forgives her nazi captors the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about at least from the viewpoint of kor the movie goes about following her past her public statement forgiving the nazis and into new territory to me this was the meat of the movie surrounded by inedible fat of her act of forgiveness obviously it was a very sick cow br br on a mission to test her theory of forgiveness in order to heal wounds of the past she makes her way to the promised land to meet with some arabs to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with jews in the us on her act of forgiving the nazis including one at a jewish center in chicago from then on anyone not so teary eyed that they can't see the screen will find it hard pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements br br firstly you immediately notice her body language defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of arab scholars and teachers her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time effort and money the entire act was a rather annoyed dr sami advan professor of education at bethlehem university gets it just right when he tells kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment br br finally the debate at the jewish center in chicago where she is grilled on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts br br i will cut to the chase by the end of the movie i was hoping i hadn't chosen to watch the movie the movie was badly made failing to delve deeper into anything about auschwitz apart from the purely trivial just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears it showed that kor the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness at best to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate br br lastly is everyone so retarded today that they can't notice the difference between making peace and forgiving quoting another imdb user i don't see her forgiveness as being weak quite the contrary she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul she wanted the suffering to be over so she let it go that would be the perfect layman's definition of making peace br br i guess in a world of propaganda blind faith and political correctness there is no room to question those that have gone through more than the human mind can fathom br br p s the dictionary certainly should go into all those books to buy lists everyone keeps making
<START> thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggles over family honor david morse is the responsible straight laced cop and 'good' brother viggo mortensen the 'bad' boy is a former soldier and ex convict as an actor particularly in his earliest years sean penn seems to have modulated his performances under the method turning first time writer and director for this arty obtuse drama he works his script and characters out through the same methodical process slowing the pacing down to a crawl ostensibly so we can catch every nuance and inflection this approach might be fascinating if there were three dimensional characters to care about but photogenic morse and mortensen aren't really convincing as siblings worse we expect more from prominently billed veterans charles bronson and sandy dennis who hardly get a chance to come through with anything interesting the picture is balky with turgid sequences a wobbly narrative and confusing editing always slanted to point up the artistic excesses penn's tricks with the camera show off a talented eye yet they are mostly an irritation 1 2 from
<START> bonfires of the vanities is a film drenched in flop sweat i can recall no film that has tried so hard to be so unrelentingly outrageous provocative and important yet failed so consistently across the board it is like a stand up comic who's not getting laughs but can't leave the stage the harder the film tries the louder each attempt at a laugh results in a resounding thud the desperation the film displays is so glaring it almost rouses pity for all those involved br br the film achieves laugh out loud status only twice once is in the sight of geraldo rivera playing an obnoxious arrogant and amoral tv tabloid journalist which is funny only because he apparently doesn't realize he is playing himself the other scene that deserves to be laughed at is the film's final big moment wherein the judge played by morgan freeman delivers the sanctimonious lecture about what morality is it's what your mama taught ya the pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd br br yet one must admit it is a noble effort it does have a good if poorly cast band of actors who try to make characters out of cardboard thin caricatures the film looks professionally made and the little cinematic flourishes that director brian depalma just loves are apparent if not particularly effective but the film which apparently wishes to be a commentary on modern morals and ethics never arises above the level of cartoon satire requires style farce requires energy even sitcom requires timing but the best bonfires can muster is desperation in the end you don't want to laugh you just want to turn away
<START> the only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel br br from start to finish the tooth fairy was just downright terrible it seemed like a badly acted children's movie which got confused with a wizard of oz witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearing br br half of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion the sister of the two brothers cherise the aura reader and mrs mcdonald have entirely no point in the film they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but apparently couldn't be bothered the people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on at least try and have a slight plot for them the story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch br br add the weak plot and the weak acting together the children are particularly wooden and the movie ends up a complete failure if only mst3k could have had a go at this one
<START> this film deals with the irish rebellion in the 1920s and more specifically one man's life after he informs on a friend for the bounty on his head and the subsequent consequences watching the film i got the feeling that you could take the script and with just some minor updates do it again and it sadly would still fit contemporary events but te remake wouldn't be nearly as good a magnificent performance by victor mclaglen for which he deservedly got an oscar and a fine ensemble cast that includes most if not all the actors with brogues in hollywood at the time most of them recognizable character actors either established at the time or just starting out a very good film well worth watching highly recommended
<START> this juvenile bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old mens' bodies desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years how by burning up gas and equating a fast reckless car or plane with freedom br br the plot borrows heavily from mister rogers' neighborhood if it were run my an oil conglomerate and logan's run if it were heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style br br starring lee majors and burgess meredith this film is set in a post gas crisis world in which an all powerful government doesn't want you to ahem drive your car and burn gas sort of the opposite of today's enron and bush oil grabbing suv pushing government br br this juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable but wait there's more although the film is set in the future we're not shown any signs of future technology beyond a return to bicycles golf carts and horses you will believe that the future looks exactly like today same clothing same suburban houses same green lawns as today and when the film was made there are no solar panels no windmills no concessions to alternate energy br br the acting is flat and flavorless even scenes which could have been gritty or moving buddy flick honor romance horror all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase br br continuity is lacking the jet flown by burgess meredith's character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again and again br br the plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a dukes of hazzard episode br br even die hard car film and sf fans should avoid this film like month old roadkill unless you enjoy heckling exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero's gas tank
<START> mercifully there's no video of this wannabe western that a stay afloat vehicle for big frank at a time when his career was floundering the story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back room writer all in all this show stinks the story is basically boring ill conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence i must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it underrated the critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so you'll have to catch it on the last show if you up late and having a bout of insomnia but if you can sit through it you've more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends
<START> i awake suddenly aware that i'm drooling onto the plastic couch cover and realize it's a warm saturday afternoon why was i sleeping did i hit my head or accidentally swallow all of my grandma's muscle relaxers could it be adult onset narcolepsy br br no i momentarily paused on cheap seats while channel surfing and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that i blacked out br br it's that head shaking mouth agape shoulder shrugging bad but i have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea through perhaps they had the same effect on the espn programming executive that they had on me and when he she woke up a few horrendous episodes were already in the can and he she hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep no one will now how awful it is and he she can keep the 425 000 annual salary br br you've been warned
<START> i don't think most of us would tend to apply the term must see to action films but i was very impressed at how good this film was and it deservedly gets the must see stamp from me br br mandy played by shannon lee daughter of the late and great bruce lee and sister of the late brandon lee is recruited by martin a professional thief to help pull off a diamond heist at a museum for a criminal syndicate and get rewarded handsomely for it little do they know that another pair of thieves lucy and tommy a pair of lovebirds who were spurned earlier by mandy and martin to get in on the deal are also planning to steal the diamond br br how each pair of thieves plans out the heist is a thrill to watch things go awry as martin and mandy unknowingly find themselves a step behind lucy and tommy br br you'll find yourself rooting for these thieves as they find that they need each other to stay alive from the crime syndicate who are not happy at all that the diamond is not in its hands br br action fans will not be disappointed as there's a healthy dose of gun battles martial arts and hand to hand combat sequences br br what is surprising is that it's not just the action that carries this film but the romance and laughs and i don't mean your typical one liners prevalent in action films that sneak in br br it's not easy to root for bad guys but we get to see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop br br a great film and one not to miss br br 9 out of 10
<START> the play bell book and candle was a favorite of mature actresses to do in summer stock and take on the road one famous story told by director harold j kennedy has ginger rogers insisting that her then husband william marshall who was not an actor costar with her marshall wore a toupee and when he walked through a doorway his toupee caught on a nail and stayed behind dangling in the doorway as he walked on stage br br the play was adapted successfully into a beautiful color film starring kim novak james stewart jack lemmon elsa lanchester hermoine gingold ernie kovacs and janice rule it's light entertainment about a normal appearing family of witches novak lemmon and lanchester and the publisher stewart who lives in their building the most expert of them is the sultry soft voiced gillian who would love to be normal one night with stewart in her apartment she puts a spell on him using her siamese cat pyewacket and he falls in love with her br br bell book and candle was filmed on a charming set that replicates new york the movie is loads of fun jack lemmon is very funny in a supporting role as gillian's brother a musician in the witch and warlock laden zodiac club he uses his powers to turn streetlights on and off and to turn on the occasional woman janice rule is perfect as the snobby ex college rival of gillian now dating stewart and ernie kovacs has a great turn as an eccentric who is writing the definitive book on witches lanchester and gingold of course are always wonderful lanchester gillian's daft aunt and gingold as a sort of queen of witchcraft br br kim novak is a good fit for gillian giving the character a detachment befitting a witch showing emotion when it becomes appropriate and with that voice fabulous face and magnificent wardrobe she certainly is magical stewart in his last foray as a romantic lead costars with novak as he did in vertigo and they make an effective team he supplies the warmth she supplies the coolness and somehow together they spark in this of course he's much more elegant than in vertigo a charming film good for a sunday afternoon good around christmas as part of it takes place at christmastime and great if you feel like smiling
<START> disney might just be on to something here first they had remember the titans with denzel a story based on truth involving sports and a small town in middle america now with quaid and the rookie yet another sports story based on truth br br both movies move you to tears at times and both make you smile and feel all warm after seeing them my wife and i took in the rookie and we expected it to be a great feel good type movie we were not let down when asked if we'd be buying this on dvd when it comes out it was a no brainer most definately
<START> i can understand how fans of filmmaker roman polanski could love this movie and i could understand how some could totally hate it ebert was one of the few who couldn't understand why people weren't running out of the theater after a first viewing i'm not sure i could fall into either category however as someone who can't get enough of kafka and bizarre dark comedies of paranoia the tenant is effective enough for its running time or maybe not this is one of those cases where it might have been more of a masterwork if it were a half hour twilight zone episode with serling delivering the coda as terkovsky or whomever it might be writhes in his bed in bandages it's very similar in the treatment of the doomed protagonist as repulsion was however it could be argued that there was more ambiguity more of a sense of the surreal coming out through a sustained disintegration of character and location and quite frankly a better lead performance than the tenant br br as it stands the tenant does have an intriguing premise the kind that one doesn't tire telling about to other people polanski is a polish Ã©migrÃ© to paris who takes an apartment that was most recently acquired by simone choule who jumped to her near death out of the window and died soon after but the other tenants are conservative to the max in terms of noise after a saturday night at terkovsky's with a few friends there are complaints of too much noise it won't happen again polanski's good natured but slightly nervous tenant says but there is no peace even in moving a cabinet or a chair soon complaints get registered against another tenant but from him can he register complaints this is a case of not so much mistaken identity but of there being a lack of peace of mind with oneself and the surrounding people as the downward spiral goes on polanski ratchets up tension and dare i say black comedic laughs by showing terkovsky in the midst of a horrible dream one of polanski's strongest scenes from the period and in finding teeth in the wall not to mention the bathroom across the way which i might add is always a cinematic lynch pin of horror and surreal madness br br but somehow the film never really feels all that significant aside from its excessive design as a would be mind f machine with terkovsky's tenants only seeming to not be what they seem for a little while there's not as much suspense when finding out that they really aren't out to get him which makes the paranoia more self fulfilling at least once or twice i thought to myself as well 'why did polanski take the title role for himself ' it's not that he's at all a bad actor and he has appeared in several films and plays that aren't of his own direction but aside from being great at looking awkward and tense like in the church or in his moments of sort of flipping out when thinking that they really are out to get him to kill himself his transformation is less creepy than tongue in cheek a test of himself to see if he can pull it off which he doesn't entirely do despite polanski working at it well to look like the meek and frazzled terkovsky i could see at least a few other actors who could pull it off with more subtlety and affecting personality by the time one sees him in drag it goes between cringe worthy and true camp particularly when he goes for the double climax at the end which of course is of little surprise br br and yet there is pleasure for the film buff and polanski fan to see the supporting cast try and dig into the much more ambiguous characters winters and douglas do this the best even as they have to strain through limited characters and the unexpected moments like polanski and adjani getting hot and heavy during a bruce lee movie or when he gets really drunk or in one almost random scene where he slaps a kid near a fountain are rather brilliant in and of themselves it's a very good film and one that could maybe stick my attention up when on too many coffees after midnight but an essential film not exactly
