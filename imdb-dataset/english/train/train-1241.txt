<START> three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relation the base of the triangle is barely there at the apex is marie a serious short and lean tomboy with a belmondo like facial structure her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite coquette chubby i dare say fat and desirous for her first kiss with a boy but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter because of her chubbiness boys don't seem interested and it pains her br br the other leg of the apex is a beautiful fille fatale blonde vamp she is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming performing at competitive level marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool marie insinuates herself into the life of the vamp using the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument the vamp has a reputation of being a whore making out with any young male that orbits around her marie is not phased out by that reputation put a stress on reputation br br the first half is set up we get to see a lot of synchronized swimming as we become familiar with the three girls eventually the narrative leaves synchronized swimming behind and concentrates on the topsy turvy relations among the three that's when unexpected things start to happen br br it is a trademark of french films to drop nuggets of wisdom on the viewer this one is no exception here it is about ceilings and the dying see the film to learn more br br the director says that the use of synchronized swimming is purposeful that women only sport is a metaphor for a girl's life pretty and feminine on the surface while hard working and competitive underneath a number of scenes drive this point elegant moves and smiles for the public legs kicking ungainly underwater the title in french is also suggestive prieuve or octopus suggest an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously
<START> with all the excessive violence in this film it could've been nc 17 but the gore could've been pg 13 and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass bad hairdewed boy friend there was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people the violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this almost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off but the teacher who called him white trash and hoodlum though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum not even close i know hoods and am part hood they don't draw in class they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher the teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters but was just stabbed in the back there were two suspenseful scenes in the film but didn't last long enough to be scary at all as i said the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off if the gore was actually fun to see then it would've been nc 17 two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines his stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach though i would've liked to see that the acting was pathetic characters were losers and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts i suggest renting this movie for the death scenes i wont see it again anytime soon but i enjoyed the excessive violence also don't bother with the sequel i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death it sounds good but isn't the original scarecrow actually kept me interested
<START> to anyone who hasn't seen this film yet i have a friendly warning don't watch la casa dell'orco expecting any demons at all because you won't find them here this film is not a third installment to the demons series and it has nothing to do with it whatsoever except the fact that lamberto bava directed them as a matter of fact michele soavi's the church is also known an unofficial demons 3 and it's a deceptive title in that case as well so go figure it is obvious that due to the demons films success they tried to deceive the audience with misleading titles even though it is obvious that this is a disconnected story having said that i think it's unfair on the other hand to say that la casa dell'orco is not worth the look honestly the movie is quite atmospheric and even though there are a few unintentionally hilarious situations i thought it was genuinely creepy on the whole nevertheless i think it's fair to say that the story somehow tries to emulate lucio fulci's the house by the cemetery of course that's just a speculation i have but i think i have my valid evidences for instance in both films paolo marco is the man of the family in both films there's an irritating little son named bobby in both films the woman of the house is a beautiful thirty something who seems to be the only one to see that there's something really wrong in the new house and in both films there's something really really wrong going on in the basement i'm sorry but i can relate both films very easily and i'm not saying that as an accusation for the contrary my point is that those who enjoyed the house by the cemetery are probably going to enjoy this movie as well keeping in mind of course that la casa dell'orco is far less pretentious less scary not nearly as atmospheric but the formula is still there br br in la casa dell'orco charel her husband tom and their little son bobby go on a vacation trip to an old deserted castle situated in the heart of an italian villa called trifiri leaving aside the beauty of the place shortly after their arrival charel starts to have the feeling that she has been there before which is impossible considering that she had never been to trifiri before sadly charel can't get over her dÃ©jÃ  vu and the worst part is that her visions come along with the image of a horrendous creature going after her tom who is not a very patient guy to begin with advices her to leave the nonsensical hallucinations aside and enjoy the vacation however the woman's visions become more and more real and the peace and quiet that they were supposed to enjoy suddenly turn into a living nightmare the old nightmare from charel's childhood becomes real and this time she won't be able to escape without confronting that menacing ogre first br br as it is expected the plot somehow turns out to be a little bit simplistic and as a consequence it is hard to fill an hour and a half this means that la casa dell'orco offers more than a couple of sequences with nothing but total silence and the image of the main character walking around the castle for several minutes reviving the images of her childhood and nothing else it gets rather tedious from time to time but overall it's nothing serious like many italian horror films that came out throughout the late eighties this movie is pretty stylish and effective but it also offers a nice variety of unintentionally funny moments that make the movie unforgettable in a way for instance the part in which charel is brutally slapped by her husband and instead of going to her bedroom crying like i would have expected she strikes back against him by punching him on the face really hard and running away to the woods like a maniac the funniest thing however is the fact that two minutes later they're a happy couple again as if punching each other like that was the most natural thing in the world i know it's silly but i myself found it absolutely hilarious the ogre which is obviously the villain of the story looks creepy and funny at the same time too and let's face it a villain who can freak us out and make us laugh a little bit it's twice as welcomed it reminded me of michael jackson in thriller but much more natural and human of course but if focusing on the genuinely good aspects that i mentioned before the music composed by simon boswell is one of the high points and even if it pretty much always the same it fits perfectly and it helps to create a rather dark atmosphere during the moments of tension so if i have to give my final statement regarding this movie i'm going to have to say that i can't help loving it including the small flaws and most people who enjoy these typical italian horror movies from the late eighties won't be disappointed by this one it has all the typical and always well received clichÃ©s like the crazy old man who actually speaks the truth the foxy local woman who is said to be a witch a creepy castle a huge dark basement with a terrible secret and the local folks who try to prevent the tourist with their hostility to stay away from the infamous lands i would say that la casa dell'orco deserves two thumbs up and a punch at your spouse's face as a way to pay tribute to the heroine of the story take this movie for what it is and enjoy it
<START> this film for an after school special isn't that bad and that's the problem nothing happens you feel as if you're still in class a guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players we never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them they all of the sudden turn into good players by meditating also there are too many characters and no character development too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids this could have had a 'bad news bears' feel the original since there was a girl on an all boys team but there wasn't any feel to this movie at all it has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it is not fun to bag on not fun to watch and is just kind of there plain boring something you'd watch after school before your pre evening nap as dull as the day is long and it's been a long long day watching this movie
<START> greta garbo's american film debut is an analogy of how our lives can be swept off course by fate and our actions as in a torrent causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the way br br greta plays leonora a poor peasant girl in love with ricardo cortez's character don rafael a landowner ricardo is in love with her too but is too easily influenced by his domineering mother leonora ends up homeless and travels to paris where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation for being a loose woman in reality part of her attitude is bitterness over rafael's abandonment br br she returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts rafael surprisingly no one knows that she's the famous la brunna and garbo acts up her role as the diva she truly was and re prised with such cool haughtiness in her later portrayals br br ricardo cortez reminds one a lot of valentino in looks in this part and he was groomed to be a valentino clone by mgm though he never thought he could be in reality and he was right he is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak willed mama's boy and allows himself to age realistically but comically at the end of the movie he fails to win leonora when she returns home and later when he follows her his courage is undermined br br this movie is beautifully shot with brilliant storm sequences and the sets depicting spain at the time are authentic looking there are also some fine secondary performances by old timers lucien littlefield tully marshall and mack swain br br although this is a story of lost love and missed chances i don't think leonora and rafael would have been happy together as he needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman and i don't think would have been happy in a small village the ending is true to life and pulls no punches br br see this one as garbo's american film debut and a precursor of things to come
<START> i was amazingly impressed by this movie it contained fundamental elements of depression grief loneliness despair hope dreams and companionship it wasn't merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music he finds a companion who comes with her own issues claire and des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst br br des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star yet he has musical genius he also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate while things around him literally go to ruins his focus is creating his whale music in fact it becomes an obsession for him br br claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay she finds hidden talents while being in des company she also finds a mutual friend that accepts her she learns to trust him over a period of time br br these two find love with one another not the mind blowing sex infused kind of passion but a love where friendship and understanding means more for two people who have been hurt they find trust together
<START> chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos unfaltering performances rock solid writing and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever br br all of the cast are strong but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmy's anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes particularly from the first few seasons james gandolfini is absolutely fierce absolutely terrifying and you still find yourself loving him mesmerized by him br br many people that i've spoken to about the sopranos who haven't seen it yet will say i'm just not a fan of mafia movies shows whatever run don't walk and get it those same people usually love e r but i bet they don't much care for hospitals it's not about the context
<START> fred olen ray is a lousy director even as far as b movie directors go but 'haunting fear' is probably one of his better films yes it does butcher the great poe story 'premature burial' and yes it is badly paced and uneven throughout but it is also pretty entertaining scream queen brinke stevens is better than usual as a pretty fragile housewife whose worthless husband jay richardson is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster played by robert quarry delia sheppard a veteran of many early 90s soft core movies actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress you will also enjoy small roles played by karen black as a psychic robert clarke as a doctor and michael berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes the ending didn't make much sense
<START> dr mordrid is terrifying i would not recommend any adult or child see this unless they are rampaging murderers already there is so much filth in this movie it hurts my yes speaking of eyes there are eyes in the sky against a backdrop of stars only the devil himself could have imagined such a wicked thing i rented out every copy i could from local video stores and crushed them with a 5 pound crucifix that movie should remain locked in a cellar behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell that is where this movie belongs i suggest if you want some scandalous entertainment go and rent all dogs go to heaven or angels in the outfield those movies are worth seeing if you want to commit a sin and love terrible movies you need to see dr mordrid
<START> i don't know anything of the writer's or the director's earlier work so i hadn't brought any prejudices to the film based on the brief description of the plot in tv guide i thought it might be interesting br br but implausibility was piled upon implausibility each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag in more bloodshed gruesome makeup or special effects br br the score was professional and kari wuhrer seems like a decent actress but the rest was more than disappointing it was positively repulsive br br i will not go through the vagaries of the narrative but i'll give an example of what i think of as an excess of explicit gore br br chris mckenna goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body of his earlier victim wendt out of the deep freeze mckenna had killed wendt by biting a chunk out of his neck now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in wendt's demise what are the cops going to do measure his bite radius mckenna unwraps wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag it's in takes an ax and begins to chop off wendt's head whack whack whack the bit of the ax keeps chipping away at wendt's neck the air is filled with nuggets of flying frozen flesh one of which drops on mckenna's head he brushes it off when he's done mckenna then takes the frozen head outside to a small fire he's built he sits the head on the ground squats next to it takes out some photos of a woman he's just killed and shows them to wendt's head remember her we could have really made it if it hadn't been for you guys he tells the head duke you've always liked bonfires haven't you he asks then he places the head on the fire we only get a glimpse of it burning but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flame br br i don't want this sort of garbage to be censored i'm only wondering who enjoys seeing this stuff br br there's no reason to go on with the rest of the movie well i'll mention one example of an implausibility since i brought the idea up mckenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark bare shack he knows he's going to be clobbered half to death in the following days he's literally invited the heavies to do it what would you do in this poe like situation here's what mckenna does on what may turn out to be the last night of his life he finds a discarded calendar with a pin up girl on it and masturbates successfully give that man the medal of freedom br br a monster who looks like pizza the hut is thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks the camera is often hand held and wobbly the dialog has lines like life is a piece of s or else it's the best of all possible worlds it depends on your point of view use is made of a wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks a house blows up in an explosive fireball at the end while the hero mckenna walks towards us in the foreground br br some hero he is too he first kills a man for 13 000 by bashing him over the head several times with a heavy statue then a potted plant before finally tipping a refrigerator over onto the body this bothers him a little but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment then i hope i have the order straight he kills wendt by ripping out part of his neck then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the heavies for it although by almost any moral calculus they had nothing to do with it next he burns the head honcho baldwin alive then having disabled the two lesser heavies he deliberately blows them up though one of them isn't entirely unsympathetic and we're supposed to be rooting for mckenna br br these aren't cartoon deaths like those in the dirty harry movies either bang bang and you're dead these are slow and painful the first one the murder for 13 000 is done clumsily enough to resemble what might happen in real life it isn't really easy to kill another human being as hitchcock had demonstrated in torn curtain but that scene leads to no place of any importance br br some people might enjoy this especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that happen only in movies some meretricious stuff on screen here
<START> if you have read the book do not set your hopes high if you have not go read it and never watch the film it is strange to learn that toby young was actually involved a lot in the writing of the script as he claims himself in the post script of the book because the film is very different from the book br br what the film seems to be aiming at taking a rather thought provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with plain funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone would understand it it achieves with perfection the film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for a sitcoms and has lost any meaningful message that it could have had br br you are better off not seeing it
<START> spoilers of both this and the matrix follow br br i liked the original matrix a great deal it was not a deep movie despite fishburne's attempts to philosophize but it was fairly well paced fun and i have a soft spot for hong kong fights br br in the original neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker anderson by day corporate drone and by night brave hacker eventually he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions does he become an outlaw fighting the machine or does he go back to the safe forgettable world he started in interestingly he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions life rather sucks he has his girl by his side and his boon companions but he eats processed swill dresses in sweats and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery still the truth makes him free br br at least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the what if it were me questions raised in the viewer's mind what if i were capable of the impossible what if i were the one it does not even matter that much what you are the one example of with a cool title like that br br further agent smith made a wonderful bad guy as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us he was as unstoppable as a terminator and as merciless br br at the end of the matrix neo must return to the matrix to share his good news of freedom br br this movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie and it does so with such lack of gusto such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that i cannot believe they had planned these changes when the dialog is at a fifth grade level with various long words dropped in randomly i find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying br br my short list of characterization failures br br the oracle goes from mildly helpful if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reason br br major personalities of the matrix are introduced without need the keymaster for example was a cute idea but just not that interesting a character br br fishburne loses his advisor role and gets nothing to replace it with br br the people of zion are not particularly likable nor would you really want them running the world br br special effects problems br br the fight scenes are pointless and intermitable in the matrix you felt neo could lose and that he had to become something greater in order to survive in the matrix reloaded he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game br br the fight on the freeway looked quite fake and not that interesting br br pacing problems br br as i mentioned above the fight scenes were interminable br br the rave went on too long everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch not because we mind good dancing and good orgies but because we did not know about the people pictured nor did we care br br whatever hack wrote the creator's soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business it meandered used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand and was a waste of time and a pacing killer the creator's speech could have been done in a tenth the time and with more peril as zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the matrix there are now too many people who do not believe the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it further the earth cannot support even the people in zion let alone these others you may choose one person from zion to form the new zion while i wipe the memories of the people currently in the matrix br br instead we got a long drawn out bunch of twaddle if someone argues that it is deep ask for a transcript and try breaking down the sentences each one is too long by several clauses and uses words with clearer shorter synonyms br br so in summary not worth seeing br br i have seen the third one and despite what a number of reviewers have said skip it it does not save this turkey br br the reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were deep should go see some truly deep movies perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate and perhaps a bit of philosophy this movie is just not hard to understand but it is hard to stomach br br scott
<START> what a piece of junk this movie was the premise was okay but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people even the effects in hercules was better i knew this would be bad but the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs it's completely incoherent silly and stupid i felt like it had been written by some 9th grader in creative class and gotten a d i want to slap casper van diem and the other actors for following this movie through br br i've had my share of cheesy and bad movies i love the tremors series but this i do not recommend it at all it's silly and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogs will make you cringe
<START> this movie is likely the worst movie i've ever seen in my life surpassing the previous most god awful movie spawn of slithis which i saw when i was about 10 br br bad acting stilted and ridiculous dialog incomprehensible plot mishmashed cut scenes even the music was annoying did i leave anything out well the special effects weren't bad but cgi does not a decent movie make br br i can't believe i actually spent money to see this movie if anyone has the contact info for hyung rae shim the director please forward it to my user name at gmail and i'll contact him to personally demand a refund
<START> a new side to the story of victoria and albert is brought to life by director jean marc valle most people's cursory thoughts of queen victoria is that of woman who reigned for several decades and lived her life in mourning emily blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives audiences a different perspective she portrays victoria in her youth ascension to the throne and early years blunt's victoria both fresh and restrained throughout the film her strongest scenes are with albert rupert friend and lord melbourne paul bettany all the actors acquit themselves well including miranda richardson in what could of been a throw away role br br though this is not a story of dramatic arcs and histrionic acting moments the story is still interesting enough to make it worth viewing there are a few historical liberties that has been taken by the screen writing the film tries to stay true to the relationship between victoria and albert and of the social and royal structure of the time period the set design and costumes are outstanding br br this film will be most appreciated by those drawn to history period dramas and of blunt and the other actors heartily recommend br br grade a
<START> i dislike this movie a lot if you've read the puzo's books or at least have watched very closely the two first movies specially the first one you're going to agree with me br br compared with the corleone's saga presented by puzo's novel the script of this film is sometimes even ridiculous the characters and the relationships among them are distorted the story ends up reaching nowhere although it appears to go to some direction during the movie br br it is understandable that different times should be expected for the corleone's saga in the 90's and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before but in the other hand i don't know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies in contexts when they didn't fit why this it sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original film's qualities br br what will never be understandable is the fact that mario puzo coppola and al pacino joined together to make this a man who directed pieces like apocalypse now and godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies so does al pacino for being the actor he is but mario puzo shouldn't have written this how come he damaged all his previous work what a shame my friend the puzo's novel the last don is a 90's story about the mob and it is great we can never tell the same about the plot for the godfather iii

<START> anchors aweigh sees two eager young sailors joe brady gene kelly and clarence doolittle brooklyn frank sinatra get a special four day shore leave eager to get to the girls particularly joe's lola neither joe nor brooklyn figure on the interruption of little navy mad donald dean stockwell and his aunt susie kathryn grayson unexperienced in the ways of females and courting brooklyn quickly enlists joe to help him win aunt susie over along the way however joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend how is brooklyn going to take this betrayal and does joe end up with susie who loves him too br br the first and second times i saw anchors aweigh i also saw it at the same time as i did on the town the kelly sinatra collaboration from 1949 both times i felt that anchors aweigh was the better film in terms of plotting and structure all the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them yet both times i came away feeling that on the town is the better film overall having now seen both films a third time i still stand by that judgement somehow on the town as a film and a piece of entertainment is just lighter gayer purely and simply happier the numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in anchors aweigh i'm not quite sure why this is the typical argument is that the latter film is over long at almost two and a half hours this is certainly a valid criticism to make i certainly felt the length the first two times i saw it however it's also a film that grows on you the more you see it the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making and yet something just doesn't hang together quite right it feels almost as if the script was pored over and every single moment when kelly could break into dance or sinatra into song was noted and that's exactly what happened no opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up and that's probably the film's biggest weakness it has 16 numbers give or take a few and no matter how big a fan you are of kelly or sinatra this really starts to turn one numb after a while contrast this for example with the ten numbers in on the town you might well feel that each song each dance can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking and that's true but that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place br br all this long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good about anchors aweigh the musical is splashy with great songs bursting out all over like the duets between kelly and sinatra 'we hate to leave' 'i begged her' and 'if you knew susie' the singing of sinatra 'what makes the sunset' 'the charm of you' and the best of all 'i fall in love too easily' and without a doubt the always inventive always breathtaking dancing of kelly it's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening jose iturbi's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it even clarence's own brooklyn pamela britton is cute and charming as close as one could get to betty garrett without being garrett herself sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his and plays the innocent boy man wonderfully a role he reprises in on the town his singing is as usual simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing his solo numbers might seem to drag a little but when you've got the voice of a century showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film br br gene kelly's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph third in the billing behind sinatra and grayson respectively anchors aweigh really is kelly's film his joe brady is a believable real character he's tough on the outside glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal but he's actually the biggest softy on the inside kelly makes this charming rather than cloying but also gives joe a real edge that you see in the scene when joe chases brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands and the dancing again the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect' syndrome as it does with sinatra's singing but once again if it's gene kelly doing the softshoe or tapping across the screen in a sailor's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief might as well err on the side of overdoing it all of kelly's dances are breathtaking be it the pared down simplicity of his tap number with sinatra to 'i begged her' his 'mexican hat dance' with the sweet wide eyed little girl or his lavish spanish influenced dance 'la cumparsita' of course the classic image left in audiences' minds for all time would be kelly in his red white and blue sailor suit dancing with jerry mouse of 'tom jerry' fame a well deserved golden film memory to be sure it's not often that one can say you're impressed by the special effects in a film made in 1945 given the saturation of cgi in the contemporary film market but gene and jerry still look great with kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look it would turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with gene kelly would be kelly himself in cover girl and a cartoon animation br br it's doubtless that this first daring inventive kelly dance with jerry has reserved a place for anchors aweigh in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs but it's also notable for being the first of three kelly sinatra film collaborations and though rather too drawn out still a great couple of hours of entertainment watch it first then again and maybe again it'll grow on you before you realise it 7 5 10
<START> the plot is plausible but banal i e beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and powerful man has a fling with a psychotic hunk then tries to cover it up as the psycho stalks and blackmails her but what develops from there is stupefyingly illogical despite the resources that are available to the usual couple who has money and influence our privileged hero and heroine appear to have only one domestic their attorney and local police who say they can do nothing at their disposal while they grapple with suspense and terror they have no private security staff only a fancy security system that they mishandle household or grounds staff chauffeurs etc not even apparently the funds to hire private round the clock nurses to care for the hero when he suffers life threatening injuries leaving man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion our heroine is portrayed as having the brains of a doorknob and our hero a tycoon behaves in the most unlikely and irrational manner the production is an insult to viewers who wasted their time with this drivel and a crime for having wasted the talents of veteran actors oliva hussey and don murray what were they thinking and shame on lifetime tv for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offering
<START> john water's pink flamingos pecker is the best movie i've seen in a while it gives the viewer a surreal image of life in baltimore i live in nearby washington dc with a warhol like use of color exaggerated motions and emotions pecker becomes larger than his town can handle and he is separated from his loved ones including a sexy ricci by his man loving art manager the picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth kind of like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day and though this taste was rather flat and simplistic it only made the whole thing more profound and critical it is a celebration of life liberty and the right to bear arms and everything else this country stands for juan pieczanski jpieczanski sidwell edu
