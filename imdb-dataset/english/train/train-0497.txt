<START> i normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read about movies few will see however in this case i feel i must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it i just finished watching it only five minutes ago this is quite simply one of the worst movies that i have ever seen in my life the acting is horrible a plot is nonexistent and production values are poverty level at best i know that even a low budget movie can be great but not this one there is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan's purposes more on screen gore and slashing the grand total of three times that this occurs is off screen while it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens especially the end scene there is simply not enough of it the movie is just too long for it's minimal content too dialogue heavy and consequently almost impossible to watch what happens to put it all in a nutshell with room to spare three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered their car of course breaks down and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people one of whom is the psychotic killer all three are eventually murdered one by one off screen after what seems like an eternity of boring slow paced nonsense as i said the only things worth watching even once are the murders please don't buy it or rent it just for that and don't be fooled like i was by the misleading box art and movie description save your money and your time
<START> 'the second beginning' as it's title explains shows us the beginning of the end for the human race set long before the matrix existed this short anime written by the wachowski's shows us the world that could lay infront of us in the not to distant future set at the turn of the 21st century the second renaissance delves into issues common with human behaviour greed power control vanity etc br br the use of robots or artificial intellegence as slaves or servents is common among science fiction fantasy stories the second renaissance is no exeption to this concept however instead of a simple man vs machine layout this story explains the struggle that the machines put up with the struggle for acceptance in a world ruled by humans where the matrix films show us the human perspective these short animations tell both sides of the story br br the second renaissance part 1 2 answer many questions brought up by the original matrix film such as how the war broke out how the sky was blackend what led to the use of humans as batteries and it also introduces us to the machine city called 01 which may have relevance to the upcoming matrix revolutions film br br i won't give away too much of the story as i do not want to ruin the experience for perspective viewers however i will recommend it to anybody interested in the world of the matrix or simply anybody interested in japanese animation anime br br 9 10
<START> i really wanted to like this movie but ended up bored and incredulous the first shot is a camera feed from a robot traveling towards a bomb and is naturally shaky but then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode even during quiet conversational moments to the point of ridiculousness have the rental houses run out of tripods and steadicams the fact that it was shot on 16mm doesn't help as the entire movie is grainy as well as shaky br br for all the effort bigelow put into accurate vehicles and equipment there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the movie's credibility br br a car would not erupt in flames after a single shot and once engulfed would not be extinguished by a small hand held extinguisher br br a single humvee would not be driving around baghdad in 2004 but would be backed up by other vehicles in case of breakdown or attack it would be exceptionally unlikely to be able to hit a running insurgent at long range where the bullet is clearly taking over a second to reach the target br br i believe bombs were brought to designated disposal areas on or near a base not some random spot in the middle of the desert br br the oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the green zone a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within the zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark alleys and lurking insurgents oddly james never gets in trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to each take an alley by themselves thus setting up the attempted kidnapping br br speaking of which the 3 man team is always depicted clearing buildings chasing insurgents etc on their own even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there br br how many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent hanging out a window to figure out he's not faking it br br there were no establishing shots to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was or where baghdad was in relation i had no idea who the eod team reported to nor were any other characters fleshed out these are things the characters would know so we should too br br many of the surprises and scenes are perfectly predictable yes it's obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the iraqis he's trying to move along that the choice of cereals back home will be overwhelming and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle br br finally there was an almost complete lack of character development renner's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home is reckless and addicted to adrenalin he's exactly the same at the end of the movie what's the point br br if this is indeed the best so far of the iraqi war movies it's a sorry bunch just based on the half hour i saw of it i'd recommend generation kill on hbo instead
<START> this particular joe mcdoakes short subject was obviously inspired by the all star warner brothers spectacular thank your lucky stars one of those all star wartime morale boosters of the period in that one eddie cantor played both himself and a would be comedian who'd like to break into films except for his resemblance to cantor br br george o'hanlon who starred in the mcdoakes shorts is both himself and mcdoakes who's just trying to get a break in film like thank your lucky stars a few warner brothers contract players with a free moment strolled through this film br br o'hanlon's been sent by central casting for a small one line role in a world war i film but lookalike mcdoakes gets the message the poor guy is so nervous about his big moment he starts thinking of ways to deliver his one line maybe sounding like a real movie star would help br br 86 takes later to the exasperation of director ralph sanford and the patient clyde cook who plays a british cockney soldier they do find a niche in the film business for poor mcdoakes it's worth seeing this very funny short subject which was nominated for an oscar to find out what happens to o'hanlon mcdoakes br br both of them
<START> everyone is surely familiar with this most famous of stories Â a heartless businessman is visited by the ghost of his dead partner on christmas eve and warned that if he continues in his uncaring ways then he will be doomed to an afterlife in chains so that he can avoid his partner's fate he is visited by three spirits who show him visions of christmases past present and yet to come so that he will hopefully see the error of his ways before it is too late a rather morbid tale one might think but it is classic charles dickens and also one of the most famous and popular christmas stories of all time br br to me this is the definitive version of dickens' timeless story it's the one i always remember watching in school and i remember being absolutely terrified by it the ghost of jacob marley the final scene with the ghost of christmas present under the bridge and the ghost of christmas yet to come especially i found very frightening how on earth did the film gain the 'u' certificate for non uk readers 'u' is the lowest classification it means family friendly and children welcome nothing to scare them etc this is certainly not the case though as some smaller children will undoubtedly find the final segment positively terrifying with the grim reaper like spectre of christmas future br br be that as it may from the many versions of this classic story i have seen adapted for film this is possibly the most faithful to the book most notably included is a segment rarely seen in film adaptations of the original text that of the ghost of christmas present showing scrooge the two children hidden under his robe you'd never get away with a scene like that nowadays the two children represent ignorance and need although changed to want in this film br br criticisms for me however become apparent having watched it again with more objective and trained eyes the main one of which being that george c scott's portrayal of scrooge seems simply not cold enough he laughs too much i don't want to use the word jolly because of course ebeneezer is anything but but he does seem to be merely a grumpy old man rather than the positively unkind cold and uncaring man that he is in the book and other films patrick stewart portrayed him excellently in one of the most recent versions filmed and michael caine despite acting alongside the muppets was positively cold further the development of the character over the course of the film as he learns more about the error of his ways and grows towards redemption is unconvincing and appears inconsistent he appears to have changed little by the time he reaches the third spirit's final lesson br br but ignoring this one albeit major quibble it is still a spellbinding and ultimately heart warming christmas tale as all christmas films should be london of course looks like the perfect picturesque quaint snow covered english town that many americans probably imagine it still is the truth is that even then that london was grey and grimy Â and any snow would never have been so white and everyone is so impeccably dressed too even the poor people look rather dapper but of course it's a christmas film so why shouldn't everything look nice perfect holiday season viewing coupled with copies of it's a wonderful life miracle on 34th street and the snowman and you've got everything you need
<START> wow so much fun probably a bit much for normal american kids and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits very terry gilliam all the way through while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel esquire moments the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid hero with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike's work the layers of meaning and metaphor particularly the anti war anti revenge message of human folly is pretty damn poignant as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films only instead of over the top torture and gore he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi faceted adventure f'n rad and one of miike's best
<START> if you are tired of films trying too hard to be fairy tales the pretty woman variety love story here is a beautiful film in which a japanese businessman is pulled free from his robotic dispassionate life when he falls in love with dancing wonderfully drawn characters bring to life a story that is at once deeply funny and poignantly moving
<START> i mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car so what if their ten it's way too immature for a little kid to sing about being my women i mean seriously the name is pretty corny too naked brothers just because they take off their pants how creative i don't get why they need a tv show i mean most artist don't really need a tv show about themselves especially the naked brothers band heck how many of them are in the freaking group and seriously whats with the movie jeez nick use to be the hightlight of my years growing up but seriously the naked brother band so many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the name the naked brother's band its a stupid uncreative show that should not be aired onto tv
<START> i know technically this isn't the greatest tv show ever i mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it the acting can at time be also a little crumby but i love this show so much it scared the hell out of me when it first aired in 1988 of course it would i was 5 years old but i recently purchased the dvd of the first 3 episodes which unfortunately i hear is now deleted and i also heard warner's aren't going to release any more due to the first dvd's bad sales also the tv show didn't have the same feel as the movies in fact i thought it had a more sinister tone even though the colour palette is similar to nightmare on elm street 4 both that film and the tv show were made the same year this has more of a serious tone whereas the fims were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokey not a bad thing i like freddy as the clown wise cracker but i think that was the strenght of this tv show you didn't have freddy popping up every minutes cracking a joke before and after he kills somebody in fact this has more of a dream feel to it reinforced by the soft focus of the lense im not sure if its deliberate on the part of the shows creators or just to the limitations of being shot on video i love this show and taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very enjoyable much better than anything on tv today
<START> the appeal of ancient films like this one is that you get to see an actual moving image of life over 100 years ago here are a lot of people leaving a factory all of them dead by now and none of them even remotely aware of the magnitude of the invention that they are walking before i was shocked to read one reviewer call this film as boring as home videos today and at least one other mistakenly identified it as the first film ever made it was the first film made at the rate of 16 frames per second rather than the then normal 46 frames per second br br sure all you see is a lot of people filing out of a building and passing before the cinematograph on their way home from work but this is a curiosity piece for dozens of reasons not the least of which is that it was the first film made by the lumiÃ©re brothers who probably had a stronger impact on the development of the cinema than any other individual or group of individuals in history
<START> i've just seen this movie for the second time on television it's lovely warm sentimental very very romantic i've rarely seen actors better able to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another cybill shepherd ryan o'neal robert downey jr and especially mary stuart masterson simply outdo themselves masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable br br the movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as while you were sleeping when harry met sally sleepless in seattle and the high gimmick sorts of movies like big back to the future peggy sue got married i hate to say this because this cast was superb and i'd never change any of them but i think it didn't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as meg ryan tom hanks michael j fox and kathleen turner at the time the movie was made br br it's not superbly written e g the characters' lines are not particularly memorable yet it's executed to perfection br br the romantic yearnings are truly palpable the feeling of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated love's timelessness and all encompassing sweep the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection are so touchingly delivered again and again you will find yourself moved actually a comparable movie is made in heaven the same romantic yearning br br do see this it's lovely
<START> ride with the devil like ang lee's later brokeback mountain is a film of aesthetic and historical importance film lovers ought to see it at minimum twice as its artistic nuance is worthy to be over comprehended br br a perfect piece of art surprising depth of humanity i really don't recall another war film will so capture you will change your existing conception of history and politics will restore your belief in humanity after seeing so many killings so many sufferings you don't feel yourself numb instead you treasure the bond between human beings more the actors' performances haunt your heart the music drives your mind some shoots are not just some pictures they transcend themselves becoming the seeing of soul such is the true sense of film being a genre of art br br a film like this doesn't need long comments or reviews everything it says by itself ovation to the cast which includes tobey maguire jeffrey wright and jewel kilcher the cinematographer and the composer of the beautiful and lyrical music what an achievement
<START> there aren't many good things to say at all about underneath soderbergh's untrue endeavor into neo noir soderbergh remakes robert siodmak's decent noir criss cross faithfully not altering the plot very much at all however the adaptation drains it of every ounce of its state of the art film noir atmosphere giving it the same story set in the very least appealing places lifestyles and anachronisms soderbergh who would later make wonderful crime films like out of sight and the ocean's series with great style and atmosphere takes the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest dullest and flattest fashions of the early 1990s nightclubs have terrible revoltingly dressed garage bands peter gallagher's uninteresting version of burt lancaster's anti hero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsively buying cinematically lifeless modern appliances like stereos tvs and other up to date pieces of equipment that suck the reaction out of the film br br it could've been more entertaining and less boring had it a few saving graces like a good score more flesh to its characters more than just william fichtner giving performances that aren't wooden a crisper pace unfortunately underneath has none of these things soderbergh a fine director does not utilize his dry detachment to the benefit of his film this time that disposition works wonderfully when he's helming a crime movie with more tongue in its cheek like the george clooney pictures previously mentioned or a social or character drama like traffic or sex lies and videotape with a movie like underneath it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer
<START> great documentary about the lives of ny firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time that reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item what shocked me was not only the attacks but the high fat diet and physical appearance of some of these firefighters i think a lot of doctors would agree with me that in the physical shape they were in some of these firefighters would not of made it to the 79th floor carrying over 60 lbs of gear having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job the french have a history of making great documentary's and that is what this is a great documentary
<START> i knew it would be but i gave it a rent for some laughs and maybe some mindless fun anyone whose read a few of my reviews can see that i'm pretty easy to please i really didn't think i'd end up feeling this negatively towards it br br the plot is about an ancient army of dragons lead by a huge serpent that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes who inherited the responsibility canÂ become one withÂ a good dragonÂ or somethingÂ i don't know it was so stupid i didn't bother to put much effort into retaining it br br it features a really dumb story full of ridiculous moments and goofy concepts so many of the events just felt totally random and sudden br br i assume there was studio interference or something because the biggest problem i have with the movie is the fact that the story seems like it's trying to be so grand and epic yet everything happens so fast and goes by so quickly i feel like i've just been hit with a million plot points and action sequences in one big ball the film is like a punch in the face it doesn't take much time at all to establish characters or drama imagine the lord of the rings trilogy in 90 minutesÂ you could have most of the epic battle sequences but there would be absolutely no buildup and you'd hardly care about the outcome of those battles that was the case with dragon warsÂ 90 minutes of me not giving a crap waiting for it to be over br br fantastic cgi with some okay directing but horrible acting speedy pacing and dumb story made this very hard to enjoy on any grounds i probably would have loved it when i was 6
<START> emilio miraglio's the red queen kills seven times 1972 is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that i have ever seen mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed first of all and of paramount importance for me it has a complex twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end the story concerning a series of gruesome murders you already know how many from the film's title right that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters is an involving one and the murderer a red cloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman is both frightening and memorable every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses and here we have quite an assortment headed by the ridiculously beautiful barbara bouchet as one of the two sisters and in one of her earlier roles sybil danning as a lustful tramp at barbara's fashion house another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy hummable score and bruno nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days gorgeous scenery check again filmed largely in wurzburg germany the picture is a treat for the eye indeed ok ok but what about those murders after all isn't that what gialli are all about well i'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings shootings impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes out not to mention the crypts freaky dream sequence rats and bats and lots of 'em too the drug references a rape scene the obligatory red herrings and in the person of ugo pagliai a hunky leading man for the female viewers as i said a perfect giallo and even better this dvd is from the fine folks at no shame and you know what that means a gorgeous print and loads of extras to boot thanks guys
<START> kurt russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past glories reno hightower robin williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as jack dundee he dropped the big pass in more ways than one br br you'll see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film as jack hisses at a rat reno poses and the call of the caribou goes out br br don't miss this classic that isn't scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played note to the nfl
<START> full marks for the content of this film as a brit i was not aware that there was segregation in the us navy during wwii a very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world however the movie is pathetic direction is non existent the acting is wooden and the script is just one clichÃ© after another i can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together this could have been a great movie the story for many of us outside of the us was new unique and also interesting the sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together it is unfortunate that a true story like this which could have changed people's attitudes has been squandered on a low budget badly directed movie i only hope that some time in the future one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice
<START> with a title like this you know not to expect a great horror movie but this was really bad even with low expectations the plot is really insulting and stupid an escaped criminal wears a halloween mask so everyone around him thinks he's someone else this joke might actually work for 5 or 10 minutes but not during the entire movie the actors are not that bad but their characters are rather dumb and the story is boring and downright stupid no suspense no excitement and little gore very cheap satan's little helper tries to combine horror with comedy and fails dramatically at that it became so boring towards the end that i actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end i couldn't care whatever happened amanda plummer was great in pulp fiction but come on that was 13 years ago and she hasn't done anything decent after that so no wonder that she had to sink as low as this piece of crap avoid or be warned
<START> don't get me wrong dan jansen was a great speed skater if there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the olympics it was dan br br but how can it be possible that bill corcoran has made such a bad movie about the incredible dan jansen story because the real dan jansen story is truly incredible especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a sportsman everything is wrong the way matt keeslar and the other actors skate their technique the dimensions of the speedskating oval it is all wrong br br shame on you bill corcoran dan jansen deserves better a lot better br br 1 out of 10
