<START> upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times i have viewed it the acting is stunningly wonderful the characters are very clearly drawn brad pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels the other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western montana all in all this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s br br you must see this movie br br
<START> born to boogie is a real 'find' though a rock fan for nearly thirty years i only first saw the film a few days ago and rank it among the top rock films of all time the music's terrific the cream of t rex and the visuals consistently exciting and unusual leaving this viewer craving any more past directorial efforts of ringo starr who did a fine job here if you love the music you'll be in t rextasy throughout as marc bolan really is the star of the piece front and center even the fact that some songs are repeated doesn't matter a bit different venues costuming musical arrangements and bizarre visual concepts are all used to lend different textures and a great deal of upbeat humor to what could have ended up as 'only' a concert film in other hands as rich and full packed as born to boogie is the film's only about an hour long but what is there is totally satisfying therein lies my only criticism the video package states something like 71 minutes and at least one online source claims the film to be 67 minutes but apparently it's more like 61 minutes of rocking fun
<START> why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance i want a refund can i have my 16 back while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen nothing did happen the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot which was not really like the film why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out it was not very artistic why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading or was that the point i felt like phantom love had no story at all and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film
<START> this movie is incredible if you have the chance watch it although a warning you'll cry your eyes out i do every time i see it and i own it and have watched it many times the performances are outstanding it deals with darkness and pain and loss but there is hope this movie made me look at the world differently vicarious experience according to my english teacher also if you've seen it note the interesting use of shadows and light home room is a phenomenal movie and i rate it 10 10 for real because of the excellent acting amazing plot and heart wrenching dialogue very tense very moving doesn't give all the answers but makes many good points about humankind
<START> i was very disappointed by this movie i thought that scary movie although not a great movie was very good and funny scary movie 2 on the other hand was boring not funny and at times plain stupid br br the exorcist amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie james woods was great br br now i'll admit that i am at a disadvantage since i have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first where i had basically seen them all but bad comedy is still bad comedy br br something that really hurt this movie was the timing which ruined some of what might have been good jokes scenes and jokes drag out way to long br br also the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again for example the talking bird ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time but it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying the routine between the wheelchair guy and hanson chris elliott was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless br br some jokes even got repeated from the first movie for example the 'creaming' i guess you would call it of cindy anna faris was funny in scary movie because cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her but this time around it was out of place and not funny br br the bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around the scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film br br tori spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie br br but i did enjoy shorty marlon wayans who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film the scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film br br don't get me wrong i love the wayans family and their humor that is why this film is so disappointing they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes
<START> set in 2017 although one might easily mistake it for 1987 judging by the hairstyles and clothing the running man sees all round good guy ben richards schwarzeneggar framed for a crime he didn't commit after a daring prison break he is captured and entered as a contestant in the brutal tv game show the running man along with some fellow escapees and the pretty token female amber maria conchita alonso br br used by the totalitarian government as a way of controlling the masses the show pits convicts against a range of colourful and often quite camp opponents each having his own unique killing style dynamo fires electricity from a special suit buzzsaw uses chainsaws sub zero has a razor edged ice hockey stick and fireball prefers a flamethrower to finish off contenders but these killers are no match for ben richards who dispatches each one in a fittingly gruesome manner followed by the obligatory witticism br br towards the end of the movie ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle against the authorities and gets to exact revenge on the show's nasty host killian br br twenty years ago arnold schwarzeneggar ruled the action movie universe and to his legion of fans he could do no wrong the austrian beefcake had a successful formula that almost guaranteed box office success for his movies comic book violence plus logic free plot plus pretty female sidekick plus witty one liners minus acting ability equalled massive profits the running man faithfully followed this blockbuster recipe to a t and arnie's mostly male teenage audience lapped it up myself included br br now two decades later and having just finished re watching the movie for the first time in years i find it a strange movie one totally devoid of technical merit decent acting and convincing effects yet somehow totally entertaining directed by paul michael glaser best known as det dave starsky from cult 70s cop show starsky and hutch and adapted from a short story by stephen king writing under the nom de plume richard bachman the running man is cheesy 80s tat that looks both incredibly cheap and very dated yet despite or maybe because of the film's shoddiness it has a special charm which is hard to describe br br with no attempt at creating a realistic near future setting the film provides plenty of unintentional giggles check out the scene in which ben discovers amber's secret cache of forbidden cassette tapes marvel at the crap 'futuristic' graphics used on advertising billboards and the running man board game as a graphic designer i found these particularly amusing be amazed at the distinct lack of convincing technological advancements br br the running man may be utter rubbish but it is hugely entertaining utter rubbish that i have no hesitation in recommending to fans of arnie and sci fi action in general
<START> not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviews br br while watching bang one night on tv i found myself bored by the nonsensical random plot which was occurring on screen the entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless artsy fartsy self indulgence on the part of the filmmaker the fact that the director writer goes by a one name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness br br those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare i say more entertaining than this complete waste of time
<START> this film i thought was the great journey that forrest gump should have been it's a rare treat to watch a cable movie in the middle of the day and come across a foreign film that is done so well this film is very well acted and i strongly suggest it to anyone who can take sub titles
<START> still love it 17 or so years after the first time i saw it in fact i discovered that i had lost my copy of this and was very upset despite it's non association with the original which as a kid i never noticed and as an adult i don't care about this is what cartoons should be like just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone i'm more than glad that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our kids nothing the music is great and gets stuck in your head forever i have downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another
<START> arthur is middle aged rich 'kid' who drinks like a fish arthur does what he feels like and says whatever comes into his mind he likes to boast about his riches and knows that he is a spoiled brat he spends money on people he don't know and finds everything funny arthur must marry a high class girl to inherit a big fortune but he falls in love with a poor waitress liza minnelli she looks really weird br br this is a damn funny film i watched this film because a very famous indian film 'sharabee' is based on the character of arthur although 'sharabee' is definitely inspired by 'arthur' i think they are two different films 'arthur' is just fun its very corny at times there are so many fantastic one liners in the film its not a laugh riot but it has some fantastic moments my favorite scene is when arthur meets his fiancÃ©'s father and he keeps talking about the 'moose' duddley moore sure has some comic timing he is very good with words and body language i loved the scene where he talks standing to a seated couple in the hotel about a 'small' country and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions john gielgud got an oscar for this film i don't know that actor i don't think he did a great job but may be if i watched more of his work i may agree in future movie has some flat patches but not very long ones looking forward to watch the sequel
<START> my first review of 2010 is into the blue 2 the reef the story is about two divers played by chris carmack and laura vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at a bottom of a local reef one day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by david anders and marsha thomason they tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about columbus' hidden treasure that is reported at the bottom of the reef br br next day the four dive to the bottom of the reef and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing a few more days past and the two hired divers found out that they a part of a major deadly plot in which they can't escape otherwise they will be killed they were hired to find two big containers one contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a core br br the movie also has a back story about another person brother of the lead character trying to patch things up with his girlfriend i reckon this part of the story was a waste of time this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and wasn't needed to be shown br br however apart from that this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives 4 stars into the blue 2 is a sequel only by name none of the original actors or characters return it has a dumb plot stupid characters and a boring climax
<START> young handsome muscular joe buck jon voight moves from texas to new york thinking he'll make a living by being a stud he gets there and finds out quickly that it isn't going to be easy he goes through one degrading experience after another at the end of his rope he hooks up with crippled sleazy ratso rizzo dustin hoffman together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to florida but will they make it br br very dark disturbing yet fascinating movie director john schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of nyc and its inhabitants in that way it's dated the city may have been this bad in 1969 but it's cleaned up considerably by now he also uses every camera trick in the book color turning to black white trippy dream sequences flash forwards flash backs especially involving a rape shock cuts weird sound effects you name it it keeps you disoriented and off center but i couldn't stop watching br br there isn't much of a story it basically centers on the friendship between rizzo and buck there is an implication that they may have been lovers the final shot sort of shows that it's just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold cruel urban jungle br br this was originally rated x in 1969 the only reason being that the mpaa didn't think that parents would want their children to see this nevertheless it was a big hit with high schoolers back then x meant no one under 17 it also has been the only x rated film ever to win an academy award as best picture hoffman and voight were up for acting awards as was mysteriously sylvia miles who was in the picture for a total of maybe 5 minutes it was eventually lowered to an r with no cuts when it was reissued in 1980 br br also the excellent song everybody's talkin' was introduced in this film and became a big hit br br a great film but very dark i'm giving it a 10 don't see it on commercial tv it's cut to ribbons and incomprehensible
<START> this post may contain spoilers br br although it was 5 years after the series ended and wb was currently working on justice league this animated movie is a welcome addition to the video library why well if mask of the phantasm compliments the first 70 episodes of batman the animated series and subzero compliments the 15 episodes of the adventures of batman and robin then mystery of the batwoman compliments the final 24 episodes of the gotham knights version of batman kevin conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection i admit i was a bit leery when i heard about batwoman and all i could think about were the old 50's comics of batman but i was blown away by the batwoman character her look her costume which i assumed inspired bruce wayne to create the costume on batman beyond and the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who batwoman is all the way through if you want to know who batwoman is then buy or rent the dvd barbara gordon makes a cameo appearance and i think the writers were trying to hint that bruce and barbara had something going on between them like they did in batman beyond tim drake appears as robin but his role is a small one and sadly there is no sign of or mention of dick grayson alias nightwing which leads me to believe he has established himself in bludhaven his city in the comics br br of the three suspects for batwoman my favorite is kathy duquesne who looks an awful lot like halle berry kelly ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects when it comes to the villains i'm glad the penguin was one of them but i did not like the fact that they replaced paul williams with david ogden stiers pengy just didn't sound right same thing goes for robin the new guy did okay but just as i was starting to get used to matt valencia they replaced him it's interesting to note that kevin michael richardson who voices carlton duquesne is now the voice of the joker in the batman series and we finally see what rupert thorne looks like revamped since he didn't show up in the gotham knights episodes the late john vernon will be missed although i enjoyed henry silva as the voice of bane if he had to be replaced they got the right man in the form of hector elizondo i only wish they could have used two face riddler or the scary new version of the scarecrow br br the musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb i wish that was on a soundtrack and i especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented cherie in the iceberg lounge along with her song betcha neva while some feel that this movie is weaker than the mask of the phantasm and subzero i find it just as strong and enjoyable as the rest plus like i said earlier it's a full length movie based off the gotham knights version of batman which i think gives a good balance i would at least recommend renting this dvd first before buying it for those who might be leery of this movie but personally it's well worth the purchase i give mystery of the batwoman a 9
<START> the matador is a dark comedy starring pierce brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straight arrow happily married american businessman greg kinnear in mexico although the sardonic julian ironically surnamed noble appears to be a tough guy on the surface underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless thus on his birthday he reaches out to danny a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by julian's unconventional lifestyle in fact both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter franker moments of self evaluation br br although the film is a bit too reminiscent of analyze this and midnight run to feel entirely fresh and original the matador nevertheless earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting brosnan looking aged and almost used up sinks his teeth into the role of julian in a way he never has before playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment then genuine and sympathetic the next he always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale kinnear is also excellent as the regular joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the dark side as his relationship with julian deepens hope davis does a fine job as bean danny's loyal and loving wife who like her husband finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and dangerous figure from a world far different from the one she knows br br at times we find ourselves feeling that the matador is holding something back from us not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise at the end it feels a little too light a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should this could be because this is the feature film debut for writer director richard shephard and he hasn't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet still one appreciates the fact that he doesn't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh br br 'the matador is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will hopefully signal a new phase in brosnan's acting career
<START> deliverance is a stunning thriller every bit as exciting as any good thriller should aspire to be but also stomach churningly frightening though it is not a horror movie it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film the very thought of being a normal red blooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies is surely the worst nightmare of 99 9 of the world's population it would have been easy for deliverance to slip into exploitation territory but john boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity with so many films you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the hero's shoes performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl but with deliverance you come away praying to god that you'll never have to experience what these four protagonists go through br br four city guys ed jon voight lewis burt reynolds drew ronny cox and bobby ned beatty head out into the wilderness to spend a few days canoing down a soon to be dammed river the guys are riding the rapids in pairs and ed and bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the riverside and await their pals in the adjacent woodland here they fall foul of two local woodlanders bill mckinney and herbert coward who tie ed to a tree while one of them strips and rapes bobby instructing him perversely to squeal like a pig lewis and drew arrive unseen and lewis being a fair archer kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest under great emotional stress the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area but they find the river increasingly dangerous to negotiate as they journey downstream and the risk to their lives heightens when the surviving hillbilly returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen vantage point in the rocky cliffs beside the river br br deliverance is very powerful as a survival tale but even more powerful and disturbing as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters though all the performances are remarkable one must take particular note of beatty's efforts in a role that many actors would've turned down the film is very similar thematically to the 1971 film straw dogs both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction the backdrop of the rugged countryside in deliverance is beautiful to look at but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape with nobody to rely on other than themselves this truly is suspenseful film making at its finest
<START> mr destiny 3 5 5 stars br br mr destiny's theme is recycled from many films spanning many different years its theme ranges from recent spoofs on such plots see scrooged to the same more serious and dramatic notion that worked in it's a wonderful life and a century earlier in the story of scrooge as told by charles dickens in a christmas carol it involves an ungrateful man being taken on a guided tour of his life and witnessing how his life could have been or would have been first hand br br in most of these types of movies the guardian angel rescues a man from ungratefulness and shows him his life in retrospect or how it could have been should have been would have been in this case we are shown a businessman named larry james belushi he hates his life he lives with an unexciting wife linda hamilton and yearns for a bigger life with bigger meaning if only he had hit the ball at the state championship in high school years ago he is convinced his life would have been better i guess he remembers this seemingly small moment of his life because it made a big impact on his subconscious side but i doubt a grown man would yearn for one single act from high school still it works in the movie br br anyway larry is driving home from work one night where he is a penpusher along with jon lovitz when his car breaks down he wanders into a bar looking for a pay phone and reluctantly decides to tell the bartender michael caine about the way his life is turning out this is where we first see him remembering his childhood baseball strike out br br the bartender listens and nods apparently not worrying about any other customers this is probably due to the fact that the bar though old and tattered seems to have never been occupied by any living humans save these two men in fact larry even makes a comment about never seeing the bar before this is most likely for a certain reason that the audience is expecting before larry br br so the bartender who may as well be an angel of god incarnate just like clarence fixes larry a special drink of his which ends up putting larry's life on reverse showing him what his life would have been like if he had hit the home run all those years before but larry has no idea of any change at first just like jimmy stewart didn't realize that clarence had erased his life until he went into the bar and got kicked out larry continues to be oblivious to any change until he goes to his home to find the lawn different outside and a large wrestler type man occupying his home br br larry soon finds out his life would indeed have been very different had he hit the home run instead of marrying linda hamilton he married rene russo and moved into a large mansion with children he finds out that jon lovitz is no longer his friend but an employee of his and the most surprising fact of all is that with his new life that larry has always wanted he finds himself lusting after his old wife linda hamilton proof that sometimes money and a great looking yet shallow wife don't make up everything in a man's life like an intelligent wife and love and true happiness just like it's a wonderful life showed the audience a man's life is what he makes it and that every person has an impact on people mr destiny shows us that material wealth is not the same as spiritual wealth a lesson taught us over and over again but never quite so fluffy forgettable and truly sweet as it is shown us in mr destiny br br mr destiny is never exceedingly hilarious but it is a sweet good natured comedy that never takes itself too seriously the problem with all the it's a wonderful life retreads out there like the family man is that they try to be as influential and memorable as it's a wonderful life was but there are only so many times you can single handedly rip off a famous film and mr destiny knows this and plays right to the fact it doesn't try to be anything it isn't rather it is something it didn't try to be and this is obvious to the audience br br
<START> follow up to 1973's far better cleopatra jones has statuesque black actress tamara dobson returning to her signature role as chic super tough narcotics agent here busting a heroin ring in hong kong cross pollination of blaxploitation action flick and kung fu b movie is fun at the outset but eventually flags the shoot out finale is right off the assembly line and dobson herself seems less energetic than before she's still sexy and she puts a unique spin on her comically stilted dialogue but these surroundings may have been too much of one thing for her she's jaded stella stevens plays the villainess this time she's good but can't match shelley winters in the predecessor from
<START> the worst movie i have seen in a while yeah its fun to fantasize but if that is what you are looking for i suggest you see brewsters millions this was just terrible and corny and terrible at being corny unless you are five or like terrible movies don't see this one
<START> hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of 8 s this movie's true score br br as mentioned before chris rock is the king previous to going to see this movie i wasn't that over the top about him but now i'm banging on the doors of chris rock's website begging him to take me on as his protege this film is truly funny if you don't find this movie funny you really need therapy and it's humour which targets all areas of society including race predictably class division love wealth employment dreams stand up comedy the list goes on br br there was one slight disappointment for me however this was that in going into this film i didn't realise that it was actually a remake of heaven can wait another quite good movie made in 1971 with warren beatty as such i was quite surprised when i watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie i had watched on tv a few weeks ago regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that chris rock is funnier than warren beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any you get the picture br br well to the actual plot of the film br br don't spoil the experience for yourself don't read the plot just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on imdb so far that have raved mad about it go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time go and see it because it's a cinema experience that doesn't leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets go see it because it is a good movie
<START> one doesn't get to enjoy this gem the 1936 invisible ray often but no can forget it the story is elegant karloff austere and embittered in his carpathian mountain retreat is janos rukh genius science who reads ancient beams of light to ascertain events in the great geological pastÂparticularly the crash of a potent radioactive meteor in africa joining him is the ever elegant lugosi as a rare hero who studies astro chemistry frances drake is the lovely underused young wife frank lawton the romantic temptation and the divine violet kemble cooper is mother rukh in a performance worthy of maria ospenskya br br the story moves swiftly in bold episodes with special effects that are still handsome it also contains some wonderful lines one rukh restores his mother's sight he asks mother can you see can you see yes i can seeÂmore clearly than ever and what i see frightens me even better when mother rukh says he broke the first law of science i am not alone among my acquaintance in having puzzled for many many years exactly what this first law of science is br br this movie is definitely desert island material
