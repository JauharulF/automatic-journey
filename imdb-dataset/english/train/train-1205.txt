<START> really i think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a truly bad film in fact the movie is done very well in many respects and is very entertaining br br yes the script is a little convoluted but that's the genre the film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale just like all the old noir classics this too has a screenplay that twists you around so that you don't always know how to make sense of it at first and it can be a stretch if you think too deeply and try to put all of the pieces together that's the genre in general the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing and in turn surprised without abandoning the viewer br br sharon stone is also an easy target the truth is she looks great and she speaks her double entendre laden dialog in such a way as to zhuzh it up into something mysterious sexy and fun br br the direction is more than passable because let's face it you have to keep an audience interested in the did she or didn't she question for two hours in addition to a twisty script and a fun performance by stone this is done effectively through the direction by the creation of a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very stark and modern at the same time with straight industrial lines to go along with stone's sexy curves the frame is always beautiful press pause anywhere and there is something interesting to the eye br br the film also effectively builds on things that were gimmicks in the first film and turns them into something a little more real particularly the sex katherine tramell is bisexual how shocking becomes treated more matter of factly here and typically the sexuality of the film is used to better effect it is still titillating but not done so readily for shock value and buzz as done in the first i won't say that it isn't still somewhat of a gimmick because let's face it this film is supposed to be fun br br and a fun film it is it may be an easy target but if you watch it for what it is a noirish femme fatale driven twisty sexy did she or didn't she who dunnit you're bound to enjoy it no pun intended
<START> this obscure de sica delivers the goods and it is said the meek shall inherit the earth this tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated europe after the great war they are homeless but cheerful in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them footmats for the italian carpetbaggers de sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale a cinderella story i have not read the book it is based on so i cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or vittorio it begins with the words once upon a time to exemplify the timelessness of its tale for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all de sica's most accessible picture is also one of his best abandoning neo realism he always dallied between that and pure good old film making he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world gracias vittorio gracias gracias gracias
<START> i am a member of a canoeing club and i can tell you the truth that deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience as we put our boats into the water banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind this movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of human's place in nature and technology's effect upon man's relationship with nature we see it in the bow fishing we see it in the home made tent there is also city man's disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman cracker the fact that the banker from atlanta ned beatty has bad teeth is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth ultimately the struggle of life and death supersedes civilized man's suppositives about the law this canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer but alas not soon enough for the characters
<START> warning may contain spoilers which will be more entertaining than this tripe br br heres some good advise to anyone living in the u k whenever channel 5 has an old 80's comedy on late at night read a book instead i am currently in the process of recovering from a seizure due to reading some of the comments on this film on here i am actually shocked at the fact that someone actually said this film was realistic all i can say is thank god the cold war never escalated or else we might as well have given the commie's our borders i found this film dire in the utmost pretence maybe it is just my british perception of what makes a film funny who knows but in all aspects this film is not just awful its teeth grindingly terrible br br i've never been a fan of bill murray and its rubbish like this that justify my feelings towards him don't get me wrong i loved ghostbuster's which was made only three years after this film but this just sums bill murray up really i can safely say that i haven't wasted my time so blatantly like this since seeing the first running of operation delta force over here though these two films have more in common than you would think for 1 thing they both have terrible action sequences from beginning to end and 2nd they are both riddled with cheesy clichÃ©'s throughout br br heres one thing these guys are supposed to be in the u s army yet they are allowed to wallow around their camp willy nilly seducing female military police officers and subsequently shagging them silly in the generals quarters talk about random this film is just terrible for this i'm afraid now don't get me wrong i'm no feminist sympathiser but the fact that these two women actually fall hands over heels in love with the two characters shortly after arresting them letting them go free twice is just insulting to the female race the fact that one tatty haired fat lipped bum winger and his hapless sidekick ramis can simply sweet talk themselves into into the mp's underwear to which they fall madly in love with the two of them is nothing short of ludicrous br br then there is the training scenes where you get to meet the squad phycho who unconvincingly threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his stuff followed by the overweight bloke played by the late and great john candy who claims he joined the army to avoid paying 400 for anger management classes leading to loud mouthed murray paying tribute to the giant toe wtf 'drill seargent' who honestly couldn't organise a pi up in a brewery let alone his band of recruits all this scene serves to do is to prelude loads of fight scenes with people saying way to go ass hole' all the time etc etc br br the scenes then carry on showing the rag tag bunch making utter tits of themselves on the assault course leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air at some passing birds with an assault rifle peppering a watch tower with bullets just like that yep told you this film was random he miraculously escapes undisciplined as well eventually leading up the the passing out parade where the hapless squad make a magic turn around within the space of two hours bugger me miracle thanks to some wise words from murray to which they then direct a massively none military like dance routine in front of a geriatric 'general' in front of the rest of the squads all of this to the immense pleasure of their two girlfriends on the stand who really should've been arresting them everyone laughs it off though this bit is nothing short of amazing though he then chooses them to guard a new multi million dollar prototype armoured vehicle in italy which turns out to be just a mobile home painted green with loads of gadgets on the inside claiming this is exactly what this army needs righto br br then there is the dire finale where murray and ramis decide to steal this top secret prototype military vehicle to pick up their newly acquired and somewhat hyperactive mp girlfriends in germany to which the hapless captain john larroquette then finds out and leads the squad of fresh recruits on a retrieval mission for this vehicle to which they then take a wrong turn en route and end up in soviet held czechoslovakia where they are captured like we didn't see that coming thus begins a rescue attempt by ramis and murray birds in hand to which is where a big fight loads of shooting from the hip and blowing tanks up with them coming back as national heroes humiliating the russians by calling them pussies etc etc the end thats right no courts martial nothing they only just stole a prototype military vehicle drove it into a warsaw pact country and almost caused an international incident which could've sparked ww3 br br this film is honestly more fun that being diagnosed with a terminal illness i know its meant to be a comedy it got all the right actors for it but where in the hell is it have channel 5 cuts those bits out the only redeeming feature in this film is the repetitive use of naked women taking showers and female mud wrestling like i said random not that it helps to divert from the fact that this is an utterly crap film of course this film should realistically be aimed at immature 9 year old's sadly we have to watch it instead 1 star out of 10 total tripe my advice do something a little more useful with your time like castrating yourself
<START> audiences back in 1936 must have been stunned at what they were watching a full fledged beautiful full length technicolor film i can't say for sure but this might have been the first one 3 strip at any rate it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on dvd in fact just how good it looks is amazing br br kudos for that have to go out to director richard boleslowski director of photography virgil miller selznick international pictures and for the dvd mgm home entertainment all of them combined to give us one of the best looking films of the classic era age br br i thought the story was so so excellent in the first half stagnant in the second it gave a nice message in the end even though a lot of people might not have been happy with it i can't say more without spoiling things br br marlene dietrich never looked better i don't believe and certainly never played such a soft hearted character domini enfilden heart throb charles boyer was the male star and domini's object of affection but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me people like joseph schildkraut as batouch john carradine as the sand diviner the most memorable to me at least was the dancer irena played by tilly losch wow there is a face and a dance you won't soon forget i've never seen anything like it in the thousands of films i've viewed just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the dvd looking at her imdb resume she was only in four movies but they were all well known films br br basil rathbone the actor who really became famous for playing sherlock holmes also is in here as is c aubrey smith another famous british actor of his day schildkraut by the way will be recognized by classic film buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit the shop around the corner with jimmy stewart and margaret sullivan br br the beautiful direction photography and color and tilly's dance are the things i'll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and not so good things all rolled into one had the last half hour been better although i admire the ending i would have rated it even higher it's definitely one film collectors want to add to their collection
<START> this film in my opinion is despite it's flaws which i maintain are few an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of art br br what mr bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films he does not receive 1 100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience if it were not for mr bakshi i don't believe animation would have survived the disney onslaught what is more with the lord of the rings he has not only created a beautiful animated film but he has created an entirely new art form unfortunately one that never quite made it off the ground br br most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation but i feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm no this is not disney animation no it's not live action no it's not cheating what it is is a new fascinating and absolutely wonderful art form something so fresh and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as the lord of the rings bakshi's pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of middle earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way in particular the darker of tolkien's creatures particularly the nazgul are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplish br br peter s beagle's screenplay based very little as i understand it on an early draft by chris conkling is a very loyal adaptation of tolkien's works where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which bakshi has created there are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3 4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film but there are very few changes to the storyline there are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled the reforging of narsil the gifts of galadriel the huorns at the battle of the hornburg but again with the time limitations he had already the longest animated feature in history these are certainly understandable though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel br br also there is the delightful one of my favorites score by leonard rosenman who also scored barry lyndon and star trek iv the score for which is clearly based on his lotr work it is bombastic and audacious and dare i say perfect it stands on it's own as an orchestral triumph but when coupled with the images of the film it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection so far from the typical hollywoodland fare that it turns many people off br br the voice actors are wonderful of particular note is john hurt as aragorn who just oozes the essence of strider br br the character design is also wonderfully unique though not often to everyone's taste but remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he she imagines not what you might have imagined and so aragorn is realized with a distinctive native american feel and boromir appears in viking inspired garb this is perhaps not what you imagined but i can only applaud mr bakshi for showing us what he saw it also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with priscilla tolkien in developing the character outfits for the film br br one farther word the flight to the ford sequence in my opinion is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build bakshi's artistic ability and tolkien's incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaled br br the recent dvd release 2001 by warner brothers is sorely lacking while we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format the package is woefully short of extras how glorious it would have been to have had a director's commentary been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over also present in the dvd release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film this version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score br br of course the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made we will never be able to see bakshi's interpretation of gondor of shelob of faramir of the cracks of doom of eowyn's battle with the witch king or gandalf's confrontation with him we will never be graced with bakshi's image of denethor or the palatir or the paths of the dead it is a shame beyond all shames that we will in the end have to accept peter jackson's glitz and glitter hollywood action film version of these later events in tolkien's masterpiece but i suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at all br br david
<START> while not as wild and way out as some of takashi miike's later films this is a very good crime drama br br the basic story is the story of a cop of japanese cop with chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming chinese mobster complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang the film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great film it is a very very good one this is definitely worth seeing especially if you don't mind a no frantic pace br br a word of warning the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty there are also semi graphic depictions of gay sex if thats not your cup of tea proceed with caution br br 7 or 8 out of 10
<START> there is only one thing essential to thorough appreciation of the indian runner unzip your trousers peek inside is there evidence of a y chromosome okay you'll do br br this film has all the male requisites blood guns car chases fond women death multiple tattoos cigarettes liquor violence pyrotechnics what have i left out oh yeah blowtorches br br as a woman i seriously hope sean penn regards this as a when i was a child ' kind of effort since he both wrote and directed the thing he's nearly solely responsible an uneven cast viggo mortensen as usual demonstrating brilliantly how the job's supposed to be done tries to save penn too late the lines and action are there even devoted skilled acting can't change those br br i found this movie puerile and silly as well as predictable the dialogue staggers along sandy dennis has my respect for trying to breathe life into a woodenly maternal monologue without motherly authenticity then she dies after a bit so does the protagonists' father played by charles bronson their absence is hardly noticeable br br at intervals the pyrotechnics etc noted above appear to liven things up and scare the audience into thinking something significant is occurring br br if you're male and under 25 you may adore this film plan to return to it at 35 think you'll still like it br br i don't think so
<START> an mgm miniature short subject br br the editor of the cole county clarion must decide what is the real important news for his readers an impending frost which may spell disaster to their crops or the sensational shooting down of a notorious gangster on their small town main street br br this is an enjoyable little one reeler featuring a good performance by comic charles chic' sale today's viewers will perhaps be more interested in the appearance of uncredited james stewart as sale's nephew assistant slow talking somewhat goofy stewart shows many of the attributes which would make him a huge star in a very short time br br often overlooked or neglected today the one and two reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents both in front behind the camera the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film something like writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel economical to produce in terms of both budget schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material short subjects were the perfect complement to the studios' feature films
<START> i should say at the outset there are many many things i love about 'forbidden planet' and yes i certainly consider it a 'classic' science fiction film for many reasons but the adulation it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion no less an authority than leonard maltin says 'forbidden planet' is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre ambitious without a doubt intelligent depends on what part of the film you're talking about it certainly was the most prestigious and highly budgeted science fiction flick to that point at a cost of nearly 2 million this was 1956 remember mgm pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling eye popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before even employing artists from the disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects 'charming' is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci fi movies yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here even the dreaded 'monster from the id' is only a well rendered cartoon figure by the disney people unlikely to frighten anyone over the age of 8 when i see the various sets and take note of the art design models costumes etc i am reminded of nothing so much as 'the wizard of oz ' with its gorgeously saturated colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects so much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless 'forbidden planet' is wonderful to look at the scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are fabulously decorated matte paintings of planets and space in the background and intricately designed miniature sand dunes and so forth to give the illusion of depth it's a bit like watching the most elaborately produced stage play you'd ever see the most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive krell complex where shots showing the vast depth and width of this inner space are well done and credible but then we get to the actors darn it the performances are almost uniformly awful though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever transcends the level of adolescent locker room humor except for some passages of barely adequate scientific technobabble even the great actor walter pidgeon is reduced to giving such a hammy performance it's lugubrious at times a very young leslie nielsen stars as the spaceship commander j j adams and doesn't convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film he seems to instinctively know thirty years ahead of time that his true forte' lay in comedy as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face reciting his lines every forced reaction whether it is anger or passion or solemn meditation looks right out of a high school play anne francis also very young fares a little better as the supposedly innocent alta whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up alta morbius now there's a name for you unfortunately even at this early age anne francis seems about as virginal and naive as elizabeth taylor in 'butterfield 8 ' there is a good story here buried somewhere beneath the crew mates' leering comments about alta and yet another juvenile subplot concerning earl holliman's 'cookie ' ship's cook holliman turns in a horrendous performance too i'm guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school based on shakespeare's 'the tempest ' the story of a dead race the krell and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about 'forbidden planet ' and for good reason for a few minutes here and there you can forget about the rest of the movie and be dazzled by the disney artists' conception of the krell underground complex is it enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings you'll have to decide that on your own oh and of course there's robby the robot every 1950's ten year old's idea of what a robot should look and talk like he's funny in places so 'forbidden planet' to me is a very very mixed bag it deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci fi films and tv shows that followed not least of which was 'star trek ' but i would suggest that anyone who thinks it's more than well staged comic book sci fi go back and watch it again
<START> a charming romantic comedy the plot is a little too complicated i tried to summarize it three times and i can't suffice to say it's worth seeing the movie is funny beautiful the plot is totally unrealistic but it works everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great it creates a sweet romantic feel through the entire film br br the acting is great robert downey jr and cybill shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it ryan o'neal and mary stuart masterson are just ok but fine if you're a sucker for good sweet sentimental films like me catch this one also downey looks great in his underwear br br extra bonuses the title song sung by johnny mathis and another great song after all sung by cher and peter cetera
<START> oh dear while chevy chase and the gang at snl set new highs with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level fortunately chevy is barely in this at all and can't be blamed for this utter tripe it seriously is very very bad while meant to be a political comment on usa at the time of it's release 1974 it still remains neither funny or acutely observed the sketches are all way too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as they're all drawn out to the point of complete boredom this is credited as chevy's movie debut and i'm pleased to say that everything he did after this bettered it avoid even if curious
<START> i got a copy from the writer of this movie on soulseek i have to say it is pathetic and just plain painful to watch the two cops act but i watched the movie as a joke and since it is a homage to august's underground which i happened to have seen it is in my book as an awesome movie its quality and everything about it is pretty bad but its entertaining and something to talk about amongst your friends reminds me of troma but good stuff i recommend seeing this under two conditions if you are bored and need a good laugh or high otherwise just let it be recommended download for sure o and the killings are pretty funny like when the zombie rips the satan worshipers dick off and stabs someone in the head with it
<START> quite simply this shouldn't have been made it's predictable and clichÃ©d the on screen chemistry which made the first my girl so captivating is nowhere to be found here and the acting as a whole is stilted and forced the writing also leaves much to be desired some of the 'memorable' lines such as earpeircing a barbaric custom are just shocking where my girl provoked a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments like so many sequels my girl 2 tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience and fails miserably maybe i'm being hard on this film because of how great the first one was but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up surely this has to come close to son of the mask as being one of the worst sequels of all time in both cases the old saying rings true if it ain't broke don't fix it
<START> caught this film in about 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn't like it as it was not what they wanted to see the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you're a fan of the genre br br it has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself br br an absolute diamond a film i still have on video to this day check it out
<START> men of honor true story about a proud and persistent black navy diver fabulous cuba gooding jr is definitely a great movie that both touches and entertains and it's part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema wonderful acting is the main reason to make this movie something truly special and pretty enjoyable splendid experience charismatic robert de niro is marvelous as rough fierce and pitiless chief billy sunday role is practically written for him this film alongside with fantastic 15 minutes 2001 are two of the latest proofs that he's still one of the very finest actors of our time on the other hand men of honor includes a fine performance from cuba gooding jr who has been one of the most promising young black actors since boyz n the hood men of honor goes straight into the company of jerry maguire as good as it gets and instinct cuba gooding jr is a skillful and fantastic actor and i'm prepared to get lots of more terrific movies from him men of honor has also quite an excellent story line and probably the most exciting diving sequences of the movie history this is a great fascinating movie and i can only recommend it
<START> we saw this on the shelf at the local video store saw coppola in the credits and got excited that was the one and only time this movie raised any interest i could never quite work out if it was an attempt at a humourous film that failed miserably or an attempt at a serious film that failed miserably in general the entire production seemed incredibly amatuerish the sound in particular was absolutely dreadful especially in the scenes shot in the little bar the dialogue was so corny in parts it was unbelievable very disappointing
<START> this star studded british spanish co production looks great what you can see of it i have three versions two vhs one dvd and all are terribly cropped so badly that it looks as if buildings are having conversations with each other few films suffer as badly from pan and scan as this one as director robert parrish seems to have been so enamored with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at once neglecting the middle another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning not in any of the copies i have there are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles one mexican officer is shot shaw and landau celebrating and that's it we never find out why shaw has become a priest if he really is we never find out what happens to don carlos savalas although i suspect he was called home to star in kojak as his departure seems arbitrary and there is a strange flashback sequence where michael craig mysterious island is dancing around in a bowler hat and bad suit in the great old english music hall tradition to the 1960 hit battle of new orleans not sung by johnny horton here but with some lyrics i've never heard before on the plus side the location is great a huge old ruined fortress with escher style stairs leading nowhere some nice scenery chewing by robert shaw and good performances by stevens landau lettieri and telly savalas as telly savalas i didn't really like this film but i haven't exactly seen it i will seek the widescreen version and make my decision then
<START> rather than move linearly from beginning to end this story line of a gay couple impacted by aids orbits in time around their perfect day the film is organized as a life remembered in asynchronous fragments rather than in a sequential flow as one directly experienced br br the narration has its lyrical moments particularly in describing the impact of loss anticipated or experienced the dialog unfortunately lacks such grace the script frequently compels the actors to say startlingly stupid or insensitive things that seem utterly out of character at the moment on their second accidental encounter clearly smitten with each other sensitive phillip encourages a reluctant guy to tell him about his difficult week but the moment guy begins to open up phillip an english major blurts out you're not a crisis fairy are you later watching his lover's naked chiseled body stride across the bedroom toward him our young shakespeare in love begins to render the beauty of the moment in words the way you cut through space i can't even describe it but lacks the verbal skills to complete his thought this kind of drivel continues through the aids hospice scenes bejeweled with lines like what made me think death would be all neat and tied up with ribbons and you make florence nightingale look like nurse ratchet br br the film often suffers from a bruising lack of subtlety unlikable characters are far more jarring and steamroller flattened than they need to be phillip's thoroughly annoying friends an arrogant trust fund brat and a whining needy dweeb maintain a running caustic diatribe about every one crossing their path such patter could offer a writer a wealth of opportunities for clever social commentary but sadly their remarks are merely unpleasant ungraced by wit or insight it's hard to know if our scriptwriter intentionally crafted intellectually limited characters or if he was simply running his tether's perimeter br br the plot may be what most appeals to and resonates with those who praise this film it does seriously explore 1980's us middle class gay life first encounters courting coupling nesting the complexity of open relationships friction and fracturing dissolution physical abuse rapprochement forgiveness terminal illness death and survival leads phelan and spirtas give fair to good performances rendering complex characters over time their fetching good looks help explain both the chemistry that held these two together through insensitivity and selfishness as well as the chemistry that helped some some viewers overlook this film's painful weaknesses the decision to chop the plot arc into tidbits and present them in out of sequence flashbacks added complexity without any evident dramatic utility and in several cases left the sequence and thus the implications of a given event unclear br br could i recommend the film to sticklers for literary and technical quality absolutely not for easy going viewers in serious need of an aids survivor catharsis or in the mood for a guilty pleasure tearjerker with a little eye candy thrown in maybe but better written alternatives exploring the impact of aids on relationships of that era include philadelphia and the band played on longtime companion angels in america an early frost parting glances love valour compassion and even jeffrey
<START> james stewart and margaret sullavan play co workers in a budapest gift shop who don't really like each other not knowing they're really sweetheart pen pals who have yet to meet br br a very charming romantic comedy very engagingly played by it's two likable stars and a very eager to please supporting cast the story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence don't quite know how to explain it that films today just don't have this can obviously be compared to the recent you've got mail and the original wins in every way br br this is mandatory viewing each christmas i can't think of a better way to jumpstart a christmas feel than this little gem
