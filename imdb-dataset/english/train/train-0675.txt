<START> this was a watershed event in my movie watching life i went to see this in the theater when it came out i was completely amazed at just how bad it was movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor a very very large favor the special effects are absolutely first grade level as in any first grader could have done them toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you'd find on a street sign and a laughable story line ed wood made masterpieces compared to conquest every film student should see this thing just so they'll know the very definition of a bad movie
<START> i saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with reese witherspoon's portrayal of dani trant a 14 year old tomboy in rural louisiana circa 1957 she feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister maureen a now rarely seen emily warfield and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative baptist upbringing then seventeen year old court foster jason london the son of her mother's close friend gail strickland moves in next door dani experiences her first crush while court enjoys her company and willful spirit dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him but as soon as he sees maureen he falls head over heels for her leaving dani behind the sisters' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts which only deepens when court dies in a tragic accident the girls then are made to realize how much they need each other br br sam waterson and tess harper are just perfect as the loving parents trying to balance their daughters' individuality at the same time trying to keep the family together the beautiful cinematography and the wonderful soundtrack featuring elvis presley the platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time br br a touching coming of age film with a timeless message
<START> i read the reviews before i watched this movie and i didn't believe them i love crap movies and i expected this one to be average it wasn't this film makes camp blood 1 and 2 look like greats the film contains bad acting poor sound poor confusing storyline bad makeup and it bored me so much i turned it off even the nudity was rubbish did they even have a budget for this film i don't think they did you can tell if your gonna like this film or not in the first 5 minutes if u want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood avoid this trash i watched it on tv and felt riped off so don't spend anything on it the best part is probably the end

<START> i would like to comment on the movie april love it's one of my all time favorites because my father nelson malone plays the horse trainer i remember distinctly when hollywood came to lexington ky where we were living at the time to make april love my dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man i talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered and lo and behold he came home w the script how exciting is that also a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes especially the ones shown at the amusement park it's very nostalgic every april when i see the movie being shown once again and the song april love by pat boone is still played on the radio timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today w all the sex foul language and violence it would be refreshing to see more movies like april love come back into focus
<START> i would list this film under the horror film genre i did this because i am not aware of a genre called horrible since the genre horror comes the nearest to horrible i have decided to put it in this category the acting was amateurish you know who the villains would be at the first scene the heroine is as ugly as the movie students of movie making should take this movie as an example for the lesson what not to do in a movie it is that bad man the word bad is an understatement the villains hijack an ocean liner and want 10 million dollars they want the money to be delivered on an inhabited rose island in the middle of the pacific they would be sitting ducks after they got the money is there no getaway plan how dumb the female cruise director is a former cop navy seal kung fu i am scared the hilarious part is the way the defuses the time bomb he says he knows what he is doing and he keeps pulling all the wires one by one he then puts it in his pocket and according to the movie with all the connections in place is he mad as mad us who watched this ridiculous if you have a m i l whom you do not like to annoy her rent this movie and pretend you enjoy it i assure you she will definitely tell your spouse that you have such bad taste and that her son daughter has married a person below her family standard
<START> this movie deserved better it's great fun has some wonderful jokes and sight gags some in stuff for the geeks amongst us and we know who we are and the effects are indeed effectual watching paul reubens fart in the face of an academy award winner is worth the price of admission alone i never read the comics series before i saw the movie but have since as good as they are i still recommend mm the film although having the flaming carrot as a character would have been cool too greg kinnear is well amazing as captain amazing and no one else could be the shoveller except william h macy my favorite line in the film we've got a blind date with destiny and it looks like she's ordered the lobster see this film buy this film it's only 5 bucks and some change at your local wal mart you'll thank me really you will oh and ms garafolo is in it that alone makes it watch worthy
<START> to be honest i didn't watch all of the original 'howling' but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie so great that seven horrible sequels had to be made they started off with howling ii your sister is a werewolf i got this movie on vhs from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when atari was brand new i just watched it last night and it wasn't really bad it was just weird i mean the whole thing with sybil danning going three way with two of her werewolf minions was just out of place and quite disturbing but kinda hot christopher lee about to stab a dead karen as if she's a vampire etc actually this movie was actually like some sort of mish mash of dracula and the lost boys except with werewolves because everything christopher lee whom played dracula himself was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie stake in the heart garlic the creature of the night must die at night and the ruler of werewolves lives in transylvania not much for the acting but the worst of it came from annie mcenroe i swear at some point in the film i found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat out because that damn throat always had to say something anyway the plot is pretty silly and clichÃ©d so there's no real point in telling you you could just read about it on wikipedia by the way the thing that really makes me nauseous about this movie is the fact that it's the only film out of all the seven sequels thats related in any way to the original not counting howling iv 1988 which was a remake of the original or in other words a sequel based on the same novel so don't see this movie there's no real horror hardly any werewolves and just horrible special fx 3 10
<START> this is by far the most incredible movie i have seen in a long time the actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie the story was accurately portrayed the story starts out with a young woman from the british isles and her father traveling by steamboat to nauvoo illinois she has become a member of the lds church and he has not he thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging she encourages him to read about joseph smith the prophet this is where the story of the prophet joseph smith begins the movie accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the lds church at the same time it was graphic at times but was needed the emotional expression was very believable which caused my emotions to spill out filming was awesome the way in which the story was presented was touching after the movie was over we just sat there unable to moved i was stunned for people who know very little of joseph smith the mormon prophet i would encourage you to see this if nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life for those who are members of the church i would encourage you to see it it will increase your testimony of this most incredible man this is a must see
<START> it's a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the us i found it through a rare video dealer and it was certainly worth it this is without a doubt the best film made during the pre code era and the finest film of the 1930s masterful director frank borzage made wonderful films about the depression and with man's castle he created a fairy tale amidst the hardships of the era br br loretta young and spencer tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them and they help make this movie a wonderful romance young's trina is sweet and hopeful while tracy's bill is gruff and closed off the dynamic between the character creates one of the most difficult but in the end rewarding relationships on film br br man's castle is the most soft focus pre code film i've seen borzage uses the hazy and dreamy technique to turn the squatter's village where bill and trina live into a palace the hardships of the depression are never ignored in fact they're integral to the film but as borzage crafts the film as a soft focus fairy tale the love between the characters makes the situation seem less harsh it makes the film warm and affectionate br br man's castle is the crowning achievement of the pre code era if only more people could see it
<START> i think that this movie is very neat you eithier like michael jackson or you don't but if you like him then you have to see this movie i think that it is a very neat film with great song play and good imagination not to mention the film center piece smooth criminal which has some of the best dancing you will every see
<START> not only do the storylines in the sopranos engage audiences from all over but i think for me at least what brings the viewers back is the acting not even you gary can dispute that claim james gandolfini who plays the lead man tony soprano has become in this viewer's opinion one of the hollywood elites as far as acting in a television series goes i wouldn't go ahead and compare him with robert deniro or al pacino or at least not just yet he however does do a hell of a job playing the part of tony soprano in the years since 1999 gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor mainly thanks to his role in the sopranos that today he is considered to be among the best in the business and it's not just him the sopranos fields a great supporting cast including that of lorraine bracco edie falco michael imperioli dominic chianese and the late nancy marchand who played tony's dreadful mother at this point in the show's existence it's being considered a cult classic and rightfully so the first two seasons were extraordinary violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner but without a doubt extraordinarily done the third season was great but didn't quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2 season 4 which wrapped up right before new years was the weakest season yet or at least in my opinion it was despite a dry spell i still found it season 4 of the sopranos to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that's saying a lot because lately i've been noticing a trend in good new television shows examples of this six feet under the shield curb your enthusiasm and oz which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year to get back to my point though to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year no less is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers the sopranos ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit to close i'd like to say the sopranos is the real deal folks for the average mature viewer 17 and above who enjoys drama and doesn't mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity you might want to check out the sopranos if you get the chance trust me in that it will be well worth the time
<START> this movie is bad if you are thinking about watching it there is only one decent scene in the movie and it lasts about 5 seconds amanda carraway's topless scene the rest of the movie is horrible i think high school plays probably have better acting the plot makes no sense at all the set was pretty lame and it wasn't even good to make fun of it was just dull and very very bad i watched this on starz so i thought it had to be at least decent the mini description sounded like it'd be alright the girlfriend kills herself for apparently no reason at the beginning of the movie after you have to watch some horrible music video the transitions between scenes are very abrupt and its like someone just put a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to transition them just cuts from one scene to another no smoothness kind of like my random switching from talking about how bad the movie is to explaining why the plot sucks the audio gets low at some points where you can barely hear it then gets loud with gay 'horror screams' thrown in at random points in the movie it is the same sound every time this is now officially the worst movie i have ever seen br br acting 0 10 effects 1 10 storyline 0 10 music 3 10 br br lame meter 1 000 000 10
<START> i was probably one of the few australians not watching the tennis when this series aired i have to say when william mcinnes first appeared i though that is one crappy actor but as the series continued he toned down his performance and i totally loved him he was such a rotten guy but he did make me laugh i watched the show to see hugo speers heart and bones the full monty and tom long seachange two hands it was interesting to see speers play a nice quiet man and even more interesting to watch tom longs' rippling muscles sigh seriously long's performance was a total shock and really brilliant he stole the show martin sacks was good also in a small role and the leading actress put in an entertaining performance i'd recommend this programme if you enjoy stories with a twist and watching tom long walk around with no shirt on
<START> from the start you know this is a sam sherman film more than an al adamson film because as the credits roll a sam sherman production appears in letters as big as the title credit not only that mr sherman co wrote the screenplay and it was his idea to use bob livingstone a washed up 69 year old western star of the old hollywood era to be his male lead in a picture that sherman thought would capitalize on the recent success of swinging stewardesses br br now why would you want to have a wrinkled old man as your male lead in what is supposed to be a soft core exploitation feature it defies explanation but that is sam sherman for you his obsession with old hollywood colored a lot of his films for independent international pictures and he and al adamson frequently tried to get has been actors for their films e g j carrol naish russ tamblyn lon chaney jr etc but bob livingstone tell me the drive in demographic knew who this '40's second rater was it's ridiculous br br but then again naughty stewardesses was a successful picture for them so we can't just write this off as a sherman fiasco still by any aesthetic standard it's an incoherent mess al adamson wanted out of this picture and it is easy to see why first off it has no genre focus at all and drifts around from super soft core tits and ass simulated sex only to a kidnapping thriller shades of steckler's rat pfink and boo boo in between we get subjected to painfully boring sequences of the stewardesses traipsing around vegas to the hackneyed music of sparrow or richard smedley and connie hoffmann on a photo shoot in san francisco worst of all we get bob livingstone as a jack lalanne wannabe in a blue jumpsuit trying to be sexy gag thankfully his big sex scene with connie hoffmann was deleted but you can catch him slurping on her titties on the dvd in the special features section creepy br br this is a terrible terrible movie but i'll give it three stars for gary graver's photography and out of sympathy to connie hoffmann for having to make it with wrinkles livingstone naughty stewardesses is for al adamson completists and or scholars of exploitation film as sam sherman's commentary offers vital inside info all others beware
<START> all dogs go to heaven is in my opinion the best animated film ever made i'm not really a big fan of animated films but there's something about this one that makes it better than any other animated film i've seen the music is wonderful as is the performances of burt reynolds dom deluise and especially ken page as the king gator let's make music together is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any movie musical i've seen this is definitely a must see for people of all ages
<START> i am very tolerant of really bad sci fi and horror movies i've been watching them since i was 4 or 5 so i've seen some really bad stuff but i deal with it i've even watched a lot of scifi channel movies so i know not to expect much a usually promising movie that has no ending to speak of hope springs eternal i guess or the triumph of hope over experience as they say unfortunately this is a dog right from the beginning and i knew it but like a moth to the flame i kept thinking something anything interesting would happen it doesn't all of the actors give a decent performance given the script i don't know how they all kept straight faces it has something to do with collagen starved worm parasite creatures who are slowly taking over the human race one body at a time there's an evil plastic surgeon who collaborates with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of humans don't worry he gets what's coming to him the slug people themselves don't really know where they came from they think they might have thumbed a ride on a meteor that landed on earth but somehow they know about the members of slug royalty among them the slug princess has managed to breed with a human being who knows that she's the worm queen and loves her for her self oh must i go on please i implore you do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this anything would be better think of the worst least enjoyable way you can spend two hours it would be better than this
<START> here's a decent mid 70's horror flick about a gate of hell in nyc that just happens to be an old brownstone seems like there's lots of gates of hell around but of course this unwitting model happens to decide she needs some space from her boyfriend fiancÃ©e and so she just happens to pick one which is disguised as a nice and reasonably priced apartment she meets several strange neighbors and even attends a birthday party for a cat upon meeting with the realtor because she hears strange noises at night from upstairs she finds out that she and an old priest are supposed to be the only tenants whoa then who are all these weirdos her boyfriend a slimy lawyer played by chris sarandon starts poking around and finds that things are not what they seem not by a long shot this has some decent creepy scenes and the idea of the creaky old folks that are her sometimes neighbors being other than what they appear is fairly intriguing a bit of decent gore and even a parade of less than normal folks towards the end make this a decent watch and while i've seen this many times on tv the uncut dvd version is much better of course not a bad little horror flick maybe a good companion piece to burnt offerings 8 out of 10
<START> yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash can br br boring direction and performances with the exception of the lovely annabel schofield who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material and the ever earnest charlton heston earn the rating of a real stinker br br it's amazing to watch heston perform up to his usual par and display how really bad this movie is he even plays in a sub plot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back into the main line of the movie the way they ended up resolving it was that they didn't it simply falls off the end br br really don't waste your time on this one
<START> it is not as great a film as many people believe including my late aunt who said it was her favorite movie but due to the better sections of this film noir particularly that justifiably famous fun house finale the lady from shanghai has gained a position of importance beyond it's actual worth as a key to the saga of orson welles' failure to conquer hollywood br br by 1946 welles' position as a hollywood figure was mixed citizen kane was not recognized as the great movie it has since been seen as due to the way it was attacked by the hearst press and by hollywood insiders themselves welles' attempt at total control direction and production and acting of his movies seemed to threaten the whole system his best job in this period was as edward rochester in jane eyre supposedly shot by robert stevenson but actually shot in large measure with stevenson's blessing by welles but the credit went to stevenson only the stranger a film benefiting from a postwar interest in fleeing nazi war criminals made a profit for five years in hollywood it was barely a great record br br welles returned to broadway in 1946 hoping to recapture his critical abilities by his production of around the world in 80 days but despite the assistance mike todd and cole porter composing the score the musical was a failure his failure occurred just at the same time that his wife rita hayworth was on the rise with her portrayal of gilda so the marriage was going on the rocks as well br br welles had to make money his broadway production had led to his personal bankruptcy he sold his interest in the possible movie rights to around the world to todd which he would eventually rue and he also sold the idea of a film about the career of henri desire landru to charlie chaplin who was supposed to be directed in it and who turned it into monsieur verdoux br br the story goes that welles with a 10 000 00 tax bill to worry about called cohn and offered to do a film with rita for a down payment cohn was willing to do so but naturally asked what the film was it was a wise question welles was on a pay phone in new york in a pharmacy that had a book department he grabbed a book with the title the lady from shanghai and raved that it was a great thriller somehow welles convinced the normally astute cohn that welles knew what he was talking about cohn said he'd look into getting the rights and sent welles his down payment of 10 000 00 after cohn hung up welles bought the book and read it and found it was really pretty bad he spent time rewriting a treatment and screenplay that would build up rita's character of elsa bannister br br certainly it has a curious plot development michael o'hara is a seaman longshoreman he rescues elsa bannister when she is apparently attacked by gangsters in a park in san francisco elsa is married to arthur bannister everett sloane a crippled criminal lawyer with a great reputation she convinces him to hire michael as the skipper of their yacht the cruise also contains bannister's sinister partner george grisby glenn anders and one sidney broome ted de corsia who turns out to be a detective hired by bannister to watch elsa when they can michael and elsa try to find time together but broome or grisby keeps showing up br br grisby makes michael an offer he wants for reasons connected to his so called fatalistic view of modern society to drop out of it pretending to be dead according to grisby the plot becomes murky here he can still collect his life insurance although dead and use it to run off to the south seas he will pay michael 10 000 00 if he will pretend to shoot grisby this includes actually signing a document admitting to the murder michael does not realize that such an admission would wipe out the need to produce a corpse if all the other evidence suggests that grisby is probably dead br br of course grisby is killed and michael is arrested for that and for the murder of broome shot with michael's gun michael is tried with bannister defending him and discovers that the latter is doing a second rate job because he wants michael to be convicted michael is convinced that bannister is the actual murderer and manages to escape just before the jury verdict he is knocked out and deposited in a deserted carnival and this leads to the famous fun house sequence and the conclusion of the film br br it's a terribly confusing movie as i have had commented on that does not mean it's not worth seeing visually it is striking witness the fight between michael and the police in the trial judge's quarters where he knocks the bailiff into the judge's bookcase shattering glass or the clever use of photography to capture hayworth diving from a rock reflected on the lecherous grisby's binoculars br br the acting is pretty good in particular sloane possibly that fine actor's best film role glenn anders was a leading broadway performer he rarely made movies before the lady from shanghai and his slimy grisby is unforgettable also ted de corsia does very nicely with broome a detective who is really looking for his own interests to his own cost br br as for hayworth she turns in a performance that was unlike most of what she had done before blood and sand tales of manhattan and the strawberry blond are exceptions and is a memorable siren welles' o'hara is a very unusual character for the actor a likable but naive man who learns the hard way not to believe what he secretly wants to believe it's not kane ambersoms othello touch of evil or chimes at midnight but it is a good film for all that
