<START> the director sidney j furie has created in hollow point a post modern absurdist masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience br br sidney j furie dares to ask the question of what happens to the tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of 'plot' and 'characterisation' when you remove the crutches of 'motivation' and 'reason' br br the result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any higher br br one and a half stars br br p s nothing in this movie makes any sense the law enforcement agents are flat out unlikeable and the organised criminals are full on insane
<START> interesting characters lots of tension as close to black and white without being black and white i was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character a quiet near deaf secretary was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own get away i'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks in this film we never know who's money it really is they abscond with or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot too bad the film could have been great
<START> yes the plot is predictable yes there are a few plot holes yes it has a made for tv quality and yes britney spears wrote the book with obvious self promotion br br but forget all of that this movie is fun br br fun in an after school special sort of way but fun nevertheless br br virginia madsen as the mother does a great job so good that i'm going to start watching for her movies she reminded me of diane lane for all the good reasons br br the rest of the cast does a fine job too if i was a casting agent i'd be scouting some of these young actors br br the production values are above usual tv standards and the music was really great better than several big budget movies i've seen br br if you're in the mood for german noir this movie isn't for you if you want a safe fun and underrated movie this is a good one it's one you could show to your 10 year old daughter but enjoy it yourself too
<START> a very engaging documentary about scottish artist andy goldsworthy whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature his work is made of rocks leaves grass ice etc that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field thus most of goldsworthy's works don't really last except as photos or films of what they were now one can argue that goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality or words to that effect but isn't it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art and at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter pretentious often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings goldsworthy seems to be the opposite a stable unpretentious family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in scotland of course i'm sure those are the same reasons why he's shunned by some people on the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial
<START> well what to say br br having seen the film i still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was v dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point i had to look away from the screen i was feeling physically sick round and round and round you get the idea br br very very strange accents at many points those that should know know br br unless your getting in for free or being paid to watch it or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something then forget it
<START> it wasn't notable enough to be truly horrible it was just incredibly lame the story was not half bad but the execution was just horrendous br br to start with it moved too fast for us to emotionally get involved with what was going on it was just paced badly the dialog was so utterly un sparkling just flat and boring br br and the characters cripes almightly they made deadpool boring how the hell do you make deadpool boring he wasn't even funny he wasn't crazy he was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords he did not even know how to use properly br br gambit was boring and since when did he have telekenisis to make the cards just float and fly around or super strength to leap hundreds of feet into the air and what the heck was up with all the stupid helicopter moves i mean we know they are mutants but they still exist within the realm of physics a round bo staff is not a helicopter blade you cannot fly by twirling super duper fast which gambit wouldn't be able to do anyway nor deadpool especially when using it as a replacement for real fight choreography br br and this film stands as proof that wire work should only be used by fight coordinators who know wth they are doing and know better than to use it in every single shot as a replacement for real fight choreography br br three of the most physical fighters in marvel comics logan creed and wilson and some of the worst fight choreography i have ever seen in recent film memory it was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged his shoulders and left it all up to the special effects guys br br and then you had the break out with all these mutants who did nothing even mutants who had been shown in their cells to have powers nice to see a quicksilver nod did f all when they got out only emma really lame for this film frost and cyclops did something br br and since when was logan so pretty and the stupid the bullet will take his memory away don't you think xavier and the x men would have noticed the big freaking bullet holes in his adamantium skull when they x rayed him in x1 i felt sorry for liev schrieber man he actually brought in a good sabretooth considering the script he made one of marvel's more simple super villains feel real but he could not save the film from it's own epic lameness br br seriously this was daredevil level of suck decent story good actors absolutely horrible execution
<START> knowing what to expect on the whole from a denzel washington performance quality integrity gravitas wry humour will prepare you for what to expect from his directorial debut much like robert de niro's a bronx tale antwone fisher delivers the moving drama of the life of a young man and the effects of key figures in his life much as in a bronx tale de niro played one of these key figures to the lead character himself a character was born to play but was too old too washington takes a similar role in this as the fatherly councellor to the titular character a character that seems like he should be played by a washington from 20 years ago be thankful washington is too old to play antwone because if he had we would firstly be deprived of the wonderfully measured and intelligently nuanced performance he gives as the navy councellor however more importantly we wouldn't get to see the superb we can only hope star making turn from derek luke in the title role inevitably the character comes across as moulded in washington's shape however you get the impression this is not just because washington directed it not that luke was trying to copy him but that luke is as genuinely powerful and thought provoking an actor as washington it took far too long for washington to receive the academy award he deserved for malcolm x philadelphia devil in a blue dress and the hurricane let us hope that luke does not have to wait so long also a great piece of casting was joy bryant as fisher's girlfriend cheryl while the part could have been a forgettable support or a standard 'girlfriend' role bryant imbues it with life tender and intelligent the role transcends stereotyping with bryant inhabiting it and she makes the part significant and interesting it doesn't hurt either that bryant is possibly the most attractive woman you'll see on celluloid this year the smile alone could thaw the coldest heart acting ability and looks why isn't this woman in everything being made right now providing good support in a small role in salli richardson as washington's wife berta saying more with a silence or look than many hollywood actresses can manage in an entire film she informs the audience of the entire storylines long before any exposition occurs as for washington's directing as i said it is the directing equivalent of his acting taking the story of a man few viewers will have heard of and making it genuinely interesting is a difficult feat which washington achieves with aplomb the film is neither rushed nor showy but it never feels slow or dull it is measured and nuanced balancing the humour and drama perfectly antwone fisher may not blow you away if you like big explosive plotless hollywood films but for those who appreciate a finely crafted character piece with excellent performances and steady well handled direction this is for you
<START> i'm easily entertained i enjoyed hot shots and the naked gun and their many sequels even when most people found them unbearable i've even managed to enjoy most pauly shore movies there is only one movie that i've seen that i can honestly say was bad and this was it it's been a while since i've seen it but i do remember sitting in the theater thinking this is a dumb movie why did i see this it's honestly the only movie that i cannot recommend
<START> terribly underrated with matt dillon and tom skerritt good backdrop for solid story and some memorable lines well acted and well cast tommy lee jones and bruce dern make you hate them with passion
<START> as a biographical film the lady with red hair the story of how director producer playwright david belasco transformed notorious society divorcee mrs leslie carter into an international stage star is certainly not in a league with that other warner's biopic of similar vintage yankee doodle dandy what is but lady is an enjoyable film in its own right and shares quite a few traits in common with the cagney classic br br like yankee doodle dandy the lady with red hair brims over with old time show business flavor among other things both films feature delicious theatrical boarding house sequences as well as the inevitable scenes set backstage and in theatrical managers' offices also in lady as in the cohan biopic the supporting cast is made up of familiar and beloved character actors of the period all doing the sort of top notch work we remember them for br br need i add that again like yankee doodle dandy the lady with red hair doesn't let the truth get in the way of telling a good story but also like dandy lady does manage gloriously to convey the esssence of its show business giant hero's larger than life personality everyone knows that cagney limned cohan for all time in his brilliant and affectionate portrayal in yankee doodle dandy but few moviegoers realize that claude rains did a similar service for david belasco in the lady with red hair and did it with a panache that almost equals cagney's br br rains as belasco perfectly captures that legendary showman's galvanic personality in all its outsized glory rains gives a tremendously enjoyable superbly observed and remarkably true to life performance as the man all broadway once called the wizard to watch claude rains in action looking in every shot as if he's having a helluva good time in the lady with red hair is to see david belasco leap to life on film as if he can't wait to shake things up on the main stem once again br br
<START> blank check is one of those kids movies that could have been a great suspense thriller for the kids but instead it's a tired lame home alone ripoff that isn't worth a dime quigley is a criminal who just escaped from jail and gets his hidden million dollars from a big score and then we meet preston a frustrated kid whose room is taken over by his brothers to start a business and obviously dad treats his brothers better because they make money the same day he goes to a kid's birthday party and since his dad is a cheapo he goes on little kids rides while the other kids go on roller coasters then he receives a birthday card and a check of 11 bucks how cheap is this family so he goes to the bank to open an account and meets the gorgeous shea stanley were her parents mets fans he finds out he needs 200 to open a account meanwhile quigley gives his million to his banker friend and finds out the bills are marked so he will send a lackey named juice to get the unmarked ones when preston leaves his bike gets run over by quigley he's about to write a check when he spots the cops and bolts back home his parents scolded him about his busted up bike and gets grounded what their kid got almost run over and they worried about a bike so preston forges a million dollar check via his computer and comes back only to be escorted to the banker thinking that he's juice he gives preston the money but the real juice came and realized they been duped by a kid so preston buys a mansion under the name macintosh gets a limo driver who says unfunny jokes and goes on a epic shopping spree then he spots shea and talks about opening his account kid you're loaded and you're talking about opening an account we soon realized shea is actually an fbi agent tracking down quigley and his two other accomplice's then he told his cheapy dad he's got a job working for mr macintosh and spends the day riding go karts playng vr games and hanging out with his limo driver buddy then he goes out on a date with shea in a fancy restaurant what a 10 year old wining and dining a 20 something fbi agent afterwards he takes her to a street geyser and playing around in the water messing up shea's 300 dollar dress yet she takes it well if this was a bit realistic she would slap him for messing up her expensive dress so quigley and the others still mad interrogates a little kid and quickly spills the beans and preston is being chased by quigley in a scene taken from the original script and afterwords he is hosting mr macintoshs birthday which is really his birthday when he discovers he couldn't pay for the party he sits in his chair and dad talks to macintosh which he doesn't know it's his son he's talking to and talks about preston should be a real kid and has his whole childhood ahead of him and wants preston to go home early what an hour ago you were grilling him about his finances so preston asks everyone to leave and sits alone pondering when quigley and the others break in to the house to make preston pay and so he faces then in a finale that rips off home alone quigley gets spun around in a ball while preston is driving a go kart juice gets hit in the groin and more antics ensue until the trio get preston cornered and when it seem all hope is lost shea and a bunch of swat guys come to save the day and so quigley and his crew get sent to jail but is there any hope for preston and shea there is and she kisses him in the lips what what what a grown woman kissed a kid in the lips come on is she mentally disabled i mean an fbi agent who knows the country's laws would risk her career to kiss a kid she could get arrested on the spot and the most creepiest part of all is that isn't goodbye and she'll see him in 6 or 7 years oh dear and so he comes home to his family celebrating his birthday so the moral of the story is love and respect can be bought what are they smoking the bottom line is that is a waste of time the morals are whacked it's flat as a tortilla the kid is annoying the villains are lame the comic relief isn't funny the brothers are unlikable the dad is even worse the romantic subplot is creepy the plot's shallow and the only saving grace is the cinematography from bill pope which went on to shoot the matrix trilogy and two of the spider man films so people don't waste your money and go watch home alone instead br br this has been a samuel franco review
<START> i am a big movie fan i like movies of all types this is arguably the worst movie i've ever seen br br i get that it follows the book closely which raises the point that not everything should be made into a movie especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book have been called into question more than once br br these characters are not quirky they are mentally ill the things that happen are not funny they are disturbing especially considering they are supposed to be true br br this movie had the feel of the royal tenenbaums another movie i hated only running with scissors was even more dysfunctional and less funny br br i will never get those hours back i wanted to wash my brain after watching
<START> clichÃ© ridden story of an impending divorce or is it through the eyes of a 6 year old child corny dialogue cardboard characters stock situations a red herring zombie sub plot and worst of all absolutely no payoff either emotionally or dramatically br br does no one teach creative writing any more the true sign of a weak storyteller when you cannot create any kind of satisfying denouement just end the story i'm compelled to ask what made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place br br good but wasted debut by child actor anthony de marco the rest of the cast was at best forgettable and they wonder why no one watches indie films this is ninety minutes of my life i will never get back
<START> wow what a total let down the fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous the special effects were a direct rip off of the ring the story was there one not in my opinion just a bunch of flashy imaging the entire film was a boring stupid mess i guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns however this is the worst horror film i have seen in years and that buffy chick well she's a bad actress as plastic as barbie and just as talented no wait that would be an insult to the talents of barbie i suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box office as it was pg 13 and had it been rated r it would have bombed imo stupid movie
<START> well after watching this i can say that it ain't the worst movie ever made yes folks there is worse than this there are some good points to the movie you get to watch drunken teenagers have horrible deaths and cute looking rats eating some science experiment and getting grotesquely huge the drunk janitor the cranky doctor and yes a girl in thong underwear that has absolutely no shame dumb jocks i could'nt personally wait for the rat to eat these drunken fools i was rooting for the rat the e ntire time it had a good premise the first part of the movie was interesting though with the scientific explantation about the rats and the little back story but i think that it ruined when the dumb drunken horny teenagers come into play the rat in my opinion the one that get's lost her name is brenda was so fake must have been a cgi rat looked like a guy dressed up in a beaver suit this was pretty schlocky lame but not totally horribble
<START> it's really rare that you get an inside view at a media deception that has been so widely reported as official truth and caught so many news agencies with their pants down this movie in my view deserves every price there is in journalism it's objective yes courageous and a real scoop it can do without comment fake scenes or leading questions everyone including chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words the filmmakers only had to keep track of events and keep their cameras rolling br br the venezuelan elite teaches us how to depose of a president and sell it as a victory of democracy it's amazing that they lost in the end so far from what i know the biggest tv station involved only got its terrestrial license revoked they're still broadcasting via cable and satellite i highly doubt whether george w or barack obama would be that tolerant after an attempted coup but then they don't have to worry br br the fact that the chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians scam was so willingly repeated around the world reveals just how biased the so called free established media really has become or has always been only more so an important lesson to anyone interested in what really goes on in the world br br the famous objectivity challenge always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the mainstream view or reveal unwelcome facts that accuse us it has been true with the effects of the atomic bomb the us secret history of spreading democracy around the world or the iraq war that according to johns hopkins has killed 1 3 million iraquis by now not to mention the 60 000 afghans in 2003 that are never mentioned to be objective saddam hussein was less damaging to his people than the us and the us is ready willing to be more damaging to the iranians that he was br br i'm quite curious about the upcoming trial of some khmer rouge leaders before the international tribunal in the hague whether there will be any mention of our involvement in supporting and training pol pot's guerrillas in the 80's when they had been largely defeated by the vietnamese probably not br br all the more reason to turn to the independent media for balance if not exposure of fraud
<START> i remember watching this film on saturday afternoon tv in the 1950s or 60s it was well presented but i do remember there was a message of hope broadcast from transmitters secreted in lamposts in one of the last maniacal executions for impending liberation i'm not sure that squares with the facts br br still the film is well done the german high command reports wryly without emotion the russians are advancing down the fredrich strasse as if all went according to plan br br it was my impression that this film and a later american made for tv knock off was based on the british historian trevor roper's account by a similar title last days of hitler i was surprised to see no credit to trevor roper br br i agree the newest german film on the subject downfall was as well done as the classic the american knock off was a little flat br br few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as adolph yet i find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever speak of hitler's double alluded to in passing in john toland's magnificent historical piece br br was gibs
<START> college students who are clearing out a condemned dormitory are stalked by an elusive killer br br the dorm that dripped blood aka pranks is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans the movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring in fact much of the story's build up is pretty forgettable save for one or two brutal murders but the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax in an atmospheric setting and one fairly bold unconventional conclusion br br the cast is lackluster for the most part stephen sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character also look for a young daphne zuniga as an ill fated student br br over all this is a pretty standard b slasher effort but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho hum br br out of
<START> this is the worst adaption of a classic story i have ever seen they needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just sick br br the songs rarely move along the story they seem to be thrown in at random the flying scene with marley is pointless and ludicrous br br it's not only one of the worst movies i've seen but it is definitely the worst musical i've ever seen br br it's probably only considered a classic because a christmas carol is such a classic story just because the original story was a classic doesn't mean that some cheap adaption is
<START> this is a film that takes some digesting on the one hand we are offered a tough outward shell a story that does not only derive the catholic church but does so foolishly and uninformed on an inner layer we are offered a story of orthodoxy over orthopraxis and what happens when people follow blindly a faith that they must not understand br br at first glance it appeared this was supposed to be a comedy if so then mr durang needs to open a dictionary because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word the jokes are pale the humor is awkward and poorly delivered in particular ms keaton's performance is flighty and over the top well below the quality of her annie hall and sleeper days jennifer tilly is again the model of stridence with her hi pitched voice and whining style all of this could be forgiven if it weren't for the last 20 minutes of this movie that evidently was a controversial play made in 1981 br br careful spoilers ahead br br it all starts with the appearance of four former students of sister mary ignatius ignatius by the way is a male name and a nun would not adopt it after her vows under any circumstance simply due to that fact just to show you how much tireless research went into the project to begin with when they all admit that they don't live up to the church's teachings the sister proceeds to become irrational and abuse them in a manner the audience is to believe she did way back when in the corny all too clichÃ© sepia tone flashbacks when one of them admits to having two abortions the nun becomes even more abusive until the pupil pulls out a gun after wrestling it away from her the nun kills the pupil presumably in self defense she then goes on a screaming rampage killing a gay former student because of his sins the last shot is of the dead female pupil lying in a christ like pose as a shadow of a cross hangs over her can you say heavy handed ' i knew you could br br i know there have been abusive nuns in the past and i know many people have been emotionally harmed as a result but this imagery is fed down our throats in almost every other shot in this train wreck of a movie i have heard from the writer and the director that this is a film about hysteria and why one should not follow the orthodoxy so religiously no pun intended this explanation is hard to swallow though simply because we are never given an authoritative viewpoint that is not biased against the catholic faith in one way or another this film is simply anti catholic tripe which in the name of fairness and equality is mean spirited and hateful br br this is a film i would recommend for a catholic namely to awaken him or her to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance they face today if it were rabbi ray explains it all' or imam muhammad explains it all' there would be rioting in the streets and showtime would lose all of its subscription but sadly because this is a film that strikes out against what is perceived to be the majority it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same spiteful point of view br br i certainly hope every member of that cast was a practicing catholic so it wasn't just ignorance that brought them to make this film br br i give it 1 5 stars out of 5 not because of its offensive nature but because it was poorly written poorly directed and just a bad movie in general don't even waste your time
