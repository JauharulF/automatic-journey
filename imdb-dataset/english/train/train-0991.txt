<START> spoilers spoilers continued br br from here on in the whole movie collapses in on itself first we meet a rogue program with the indication we're gonna get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like we get a guy with a retarded accent talking endless garbage two 'ghosts' that serve no real purpose and have no character what so ever and a bunch of henchmen someone's told me they're vampires straight out of blade 2 but they're so undefined i didn't realise br br the funny accented guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as the oracle only for far longer and far far worse he has a simple point about cause and effect makes it then continues to make it and make it until it becomes convoluted and stupid his final line before walking off is comparable to storm's do you know what happens to a toad line in x men in levels of utter bland baddness the chocolate cake is such a lazy pathetic cliche and monica bellucci as the wife does nothing other than exactly what we expect the moment we see her br br and then we get another kung fu fight why neo is allegedly the one he can do anything he has the ultimate power and what does he use it for kung bloody fu all the time and while he can stop 1000 bullets he still gets cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 undecipherable henchmen vampires i wanted to see mind blowing powers i wanted to see him do the wildest craziest most insane s to people because he can do anything i got the same as before without the 'wow' br br the fabled car chase that can't be bad well no it's not it's just not what we've been tyold it was going to be all the cool shots from this scene are in the trailer every one so all possibly wow has been taken from us so all we now get is a good chase sequence with guess what a kung fu fight ok it's not neo but you'd have thought he'd have explained to his closest friends about the reality of the matrix at least taught them something it's not hard br br hey morpheus don't worry about what happens to you in the matrix it's not real as long as you understand that nothing's real then nothing can really harm you br br there you go simple br br ok so the chase is not bad it's never boring and it doesn't seem like 16 minutes it's just so underwhelming and still it gets worse br br the final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable they have this whole elaborate plan that involves three crews they then only show it sporadically between morpheus's over long super preachy monologue to make it worse they never clearly define what this plan that needs 3 teams is you know basically but you don't know who's doing what when so when one crew goes down you just don't care and you don't know how this is going to affect what goes on br br i'll sum it up though it happens so trinity can get back into the matrix to setup the end that's the only reason it happens which raises the question why did they need to send 6 people originally trinity gets in in five minutes by herself br br neo's journey to the centre of the matrix so to speak is handled equally lazily ooohhh he runs into another 100 agent smiths woooooo that must've taken a lot of thought only now they're in a corridor so the fight has no scale and is over in a moment man what a grand finale br br and then the architect br br remember everything i said was bad about the oracle and the foreign guy add them together and double it that's how truly appalling the architect is the only reasonable potential of him is he's about to set up the cliffhanging climax br br and then he blows it br br let's look at the options he gives neo choose one door and all humanity dies except 27 choose the other and all humanity dies considering choice is something this film tries to explore it doesn't really give it's hero one if he had a choice of save humanity and the missus dies or save the missus and kill humanity there's the potnetial for inner torment and tension also with trinity being mid fall the potential of a real cliffhanger that would've made seeing the third more essential but no he has save no one or save the missus br br now the very worst thing about the original matrix was neo dying and then coming back to life right at the end the year it came out everyone was so annoyed by how stupid jar jar was they didn't notice that the very end of the matrix made him look him steven hawking the oracle told me i'd fall in love with the one and i love you come on how can the whole world have missed how utterly terrible that was br br so what do the wachowski's do in the sequel well they make the ending of the original look better how well by doing almost exactly the same thing again only swapping characters only so much worse i think my f a and r keys would be worn out if i kept writing far before i got to worse br br and the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger it's a reminder br br basically this film is just bad i really didn't want it to be bad but it is bad in just so many ways and to make matters worse this isn't a film with not enough budget it's not a film with too short a schedule it's not a film that's been rushed out it's not a film where too much influence has come from the outside this is exactly the film the wachowski's set out to make with warner's fortune fully behind them and that's what makes this so awful at least rancid aluminium can say that it didn't haev enough time or money br br matrix reloaded the worst film ever made maybe not quite the most disappointing and defalting film ever made br br undeniably br br
<START> quite possibly how francis veber one of the best comedy directors in the world at least when sticking to his native france managed to turn in a film so completely unwatchable is beyond the reason of mere mortal man to discern it's not just that the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly devoid of even the lowest form of wit it's genuinely physically painful to watch such an endless parade of inept writing acting and film making that you cannot believe this is the work of experienced and talented filmmakers for once the near eternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blink and you'll miss it theatrical release tells the whole story what were they thinking
<START> this is the biggest pile of crap i have ever watched do not rent the makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie it starts with some what of a plot then fades fast to nothing i think i would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover the actors were awful the plot faded fast filming left to much work to be done not one good thing to say about this crap movie if you rent this movie you will waste your money i really enjoy national lampoon movies but this was a waste of time learn to write learn to act learn to produce and learn to direct i feel i should sue these a holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost
<START> did you know that anthony kiedis singer from the red hot chili peppers father is in this movie blackie dammit is anthony's father i noticed this after reading scar tissue anthony's autobiography and saw a picture of his father i thought well that guy kinda looks like that guy from that movie i saw in the eighties then i read more and it said his father was an actor that had a few small roles after checking this site and comparing with a search on the net i realized it really is his father in the movie it's funny because nowhere in the book does it mention him being in this movie perhaps his son was ashamed of his father's acting job in this flick but he need not be i think his father blackie did a great job in the show
<START> i think it's time john rambo move on with his life and try to put vietnam behind him this series is getting old and rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly i am tired of hollywood making it seem like it was this is not the worst of the films concerning vietnam that honor goes to john waynes green berets in any case john rambo carrying around a 50 cal machine gun taking on what seems to be half of the viet cong army plus a good many russians is an insult to watch what is worse is rambos cheesy speech at the end please oh yeah i heard they are making another one
<START> this post contains spoiler s br br i'm not a big fan of chuck norris as an actor but i worship him in all other ways he also have his own fan web site with chuck norris facts that is really entertaining but this movie looks like someone was joking with the audience putting all those facts into one movie i really don't remember when i wasted my time more than with this action i don't know what's the worst this movie can offer you unoriginal and thousand times made plot of terrorists who are trying to nuke us by smuggling nuke on us soil or perhaps that great dialogs and chucks words of wisdom about life and everything else someone may find the worst that terrorists actually speak english in everyday life it's a never ending list of crap not to mention huge amount of archive footage used in film that is kinda annoying the chief terrorist send his comrades message through the media when he is captured and the only guy smart enough to see the treat is chuck norris of course no one else in america is not smart enough to see that and the whole action in capturing chief is just ridiculous one man is sent to walk through a whole terrorist camp unarmed i'm lying he had a knife escapes his stalkers with jet pack and then para glides for few hundred maybe even thousand kilometers to nearest shore afganistan border is 450 km far away from nearest shore where he is rescued by submarine i hoped that at least fighting scenes will be good but that's even more funny than the plot if you didn't know 85 of terrorist are masters of some martial art but chuck and co beat the sh t out of them not only they kill them easily they can kick and throw them away by a single move and the bad guys fly few meters like dolls you may ask me did i watch this movie to the end i did why because i just wanted to see who of these two super heroes will defuse the nuclear bomb of few hundred megatons and size of a microwave and then i realized what fool i am of course it's chuck's movie after all and not only he singlehandedly defuse nuke with tweezers but he do it twice i could write a book about all the stupid things in this movie but i would spend my life spawn br br so makers of this movie made another chuck norris fact to be added on his web site can chuck norris defuse nuclear bomb yes and he can do it twice
<START> i found out about this film because jewish ben chaplin from game on was in it game on is a funny british sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into hollywood and star in this film he failed thank god br br the film is a very simple romantic comedy with janeane garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour uma thurman to date ben chaplin because she thinks ben chaplin won't like her because she's ugly the film is just bad for so many reasons the plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit those two scenes made me cringe janeane's character is sickeningly arrogant and guessing from her role as stand up comedienne and arch feminist is in real life too she claims that the film is anti feminist when in fact it's just realistic men more often than not go for looks over personality it's interesting to note her hypocrisy too she'd been a feminist and comedienne for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad i imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film i mean come on she acted in it for heaven's sake what this film was really was anti men if anything it portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of uma thurman's character noelle br br there are other bad things about this film too like ben chaplin's character being the british man every american girl finds cute and jamie foxx being the token black best friend of chaplin and of course foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure is that the best the script writers could come up with blimey they've never done that before except with every hugh grant and dudley moore film ever made there's also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is the other comments on here all say how janeane garofalo isn't ugly but is actually beautiful erm was i watching the same film as they were she's certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one although having said that i fail to see the appeal of uma thurman as well she's lanky and gaunt looking br br i guarantee three things about this film if you've never watched it br br you will know what the ending will be br br you will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and br br you will be bored after ten minutes br br watch at your own peril
<START> admittedly parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone although it is a favourite of mine knappertsbusch 1951 in particular syberberg's entire approach is so static whenever the music suddenly begins to swell syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace the takes on amfortas and klingsor are endless whatever happened to film editing the result is physically exhausting to watch the viewer is never spiritually transported your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that wagner got it right syberberg got it wrong and that set decoration with those clever reminders of wagner's anti semitism will there ever be a viewer of this film with no prior knowledge of wagner
<START> i read some comments on the internet about this film like harder then hostel the camera never screens of when it's getting really brutal but none of them is true the camera never screens of because there is nothing to screen of the same scene is repeated hundred and hundred times again women lies on a table killer rapes women a few times killer cuts women into pieces you never see this during the whole film police come and arrested him killer fools the jury film over in germany we would say viel lÃ¤rm um nichts all in all one of the most boring films i ever see absolutely non recommendable
<START> this is an almost action less film following jack an insomniac as he goes through hallucinations is visited by dead friends throws himself off a building and for a lot of the time can't tell reality from hallucination br br dominic monaghan as jack is truly believable confused and scared but lethargic and at times blankly accepting of what he sees we follow him trying to sort out what he's seeing and find a way to sleep br br introduce a talking dog another hallucination and children that suddenly appear in jack's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there more hallucination and you have an interesting mind boggling 43 minutes and the shower scene is enough to get any dom fan coming back for more
<START> saw this flick on encw last nite for the third or fourth time enjoyed it so much i ordered the dvd this really is a standout and of course the first of the mann stewart pairings more here than the usual oater although not quite as powerful as the searchers lots of obvious symbolism about achieving manhood but mainly it's the acting by stewart his partner millard mitchell shelly winters and the waco johnny dean dan duryea steve miller not the joker is interesting as a handsome would be hero who's interested in lola but too yellow like stewart in the man who killed liberty valance he's practically reduced to putting on an apron and serving his enemies coffee decaf no doubt tony curtis from the bronx cavalry and rock hudson behaving like no indian i've seen on screen have interesting cameos br br special performances by john mcintire as a too lucky card dealing gun trader who hangs out at a very low grade western version of rick's american cafe nobody wants to spend the night there jay c flippens out over a kiss from lola winters and has some nice scenes with stewart before he gets to bend of the river and far country will geer as wyatt earp and the indian chief who takes walter brennan's teeth from him in red river are pleasant sightings this is the kind of western that only stewart not wayne nor scott could have pulled off worth the shot i repeat
<START> in the trivia section for pet sematary it mentions that george romero director of two stephen king stories creepshow and the dark half was set to direct and then pulled out one wonders what he would've brought to the film as the director mary lambert while not really a bad director doesn't really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of king's novel of which he wrote the screenplay there are of course some very effective grotesquely surreal scenes mainly involving the sister zelda likely more of a creep out for kids if they see the film and the casting in some of the roles is dead perfect but something feels missing at times some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably king like atmosphere which is in this case about as morbid as you're going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in who knows if he'll save that for his final novel br br as mentioned though some of the casting is terrific notably miko hughes as gage creed the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80's horror movie to being a little monster i say that as a compliment of course especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel and there is also a juicy supporting role for fred gwynne of the munsters who plays this old secretive man with the right notes of under playing and doom in tone and applause goes to whomever did the make up on andrew hubatsek but there are some other flaws though in the other casting dale midkiff is good not great as the conflicted disturbed father figure creed and his daughter ellie is played by an actress that just didn't work for me at all br br in terms of setting up some chilling set pieces only a couple really stand out a certain plot thickening moment not to spoil it does involve a cool ramones song and the first visit to the pet sematary the bigger one including the sort of mystical overtones king had in the shining for the most part it's a very polished directing job though it could've been made even darker to correspond with the script if thought out in logical terms albeit in king terms it is really one of his more effective works of the period but it doesn't add up like it could or should still it makes for a nifty little midnight movie
<START> actually goldie hawn is from washington takoma park maryland but i digress this is sort of a mr smith goes to washington type of movie with some variations but the same premise i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn the story is interesting but it's highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot's life it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous i had to laugh possible spoiler ahead it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up and the speech she made at the end beautiful too bad not many people have guts like that in real life
<START> a friend of mine bought this film for Â£1 and even then it was grossly overpriced despite featuring big names such as adam sandler billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole it uses tired bottom of the barrel comedic techniques consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience and seemingly pointless montages of 'hot girls' br br adam sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women when the ship's resident comedian the shamelessly named 'dickie' due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender is presumed lost at sea sandler's character shecker gets his big break dickie is not dead he's rather locked in the bathroom presumably sea sick br br perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time
<START> br br this is without a doubt the funniest comedy of the year everybody is brilliant the acting is superb you can see that the actors enjoyed making this film itÂ´s a shame to spoil the film with give aways so rent it and laugh your ass off br br 9 10
<START> why in the world would someone make this piece of trash movie the first two zombie bloodbath movies were stupid enough but this takes the cake for the worst of the trilogy perhaps of all time todd sheets is still the director but no longer the screenwriter which isn't a negative or a positive considering he's just as untalented as the guy who wrote this one the writing is too heavily reliant on the f word which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times at nausea the acting is about on par with the last two bloodbath movies so naturally it's some of the worst i've ever seen the special effects are better than the last 2 but they still look godawful the plot has become too complicated for it's own good and was about some government experiment gone wrong and zombies being produced also featured is cryogenically frozen mutant zombie and school kids that know how to time travel leading to one of the most idiotic endings i've ever seen after the movie it goes to outtakes which is strange because this whole movie is an outtake only see this to make fun of it because if you go into this with a serious mind you might possibly kill yourself br br my rating bomb 95 mins
<START> that's not just my considered verdict on this film but also on the bulk of what has been written about it now don't get me wrong here either i'm not a total philistine i didn't hate the movie because it wasn't enough like 'police academy 9' or whatever i enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff i swear br br 'magnolia' is poor and i am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed long winded self indulgent rambling nonsense from start to finish there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie there's some high calibre actors fair enough and none turns in an average or worse performance furthermore my wife a self confessed tom cruise hater tells me it's his career best performance by far but the plot is so completely unengaging meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail's pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something br br it doesn't help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with well i didn't think so but i don't like most people admittedly they all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route yadda yadda yadda the soundtrack's dire as well with that marrow suckingly irritating quality that i had hitherto thought unique to the music of alanis morisette br br all in all it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of 'friends' whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat the bit with the frogs is good though
<START> i first encountered this show when i was staying in japan for six months last year i found it in the internet when i was looking for sub titled dramas to help me with my japanese my host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird but i found it delightful koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and matsujun's spirit made my day every time i tuned in i first saw him on hana yori dango but i liked him much better in this br br although the characters are interesting and well developed i was disappointed to find that they didn't change very much throughout the show their relationship grew but they didn't really still a fun time had by all even for fukushima
<START> released just before the production code crackdown in july 1934 mitch leisen's all star paramount musical is leeringly suggestive some even claim misogynistic and highly entertaining two murders occur on the opening night of earl carroll's vanities one on stage but that doesn't stop the manager jack oakie from putting on a show as a lascivious police detective victor mclaglen investigates everyone is hiding something and gypsy rose lee must have seen this backstage murder mystery before she penned the g string murders as the denouement is similar although more satisfying here gertrude michael as a vicious diva stops the show in more ways than one with her exotic sweet marijuana number and duke ellington finishes with the truncated rape of the rhapsody the hit song cocktails for two came from this film a bizarre and bawdy camp classic highly recommended here's louella o parsons in the los angeles examiner on may 17 1934 br br earl carroll's hand picked beauties' pirouette about on the grauman united artists screen in a fig leaf and not much else but september morn herself never had a better figure than these charmers who are made up to please the eye especially the eye of the tired businessman but don't for a moment think mr carroll's girls au naturelle are the only attraction believe it or not murder at the vanities is a musical comedy thriller if you know what i mean a murder mystery incorporated in a musical show it all happens on the opening night at the time the play is in progress and a search is on for a murderer just by way of suspense a cop threatens to stop the show every few minutes victor mclaglen is something new in cops all the time he is trying to track down the murderer he keeps his eye fastened on the chorus beauties the murder mystery is good with the exception of the denouement which is pretty flat probably faulty direction dorothy stickney who plays the maid is about as melodramatic as the heroine in a ten twenty and thirty show for no good reason she rates a never ending closeup in the big dramatic scene the girl ensembles are good and it's a positive relief to get away from the inevitable overhead shots the costumes are beautiful in fact this is a musical that paramount can feel is really to their credit as for carl brisson well he would be an addition to any show good looking with a delightful singing voice and an easy assured manner he is all his press agents claim for him i also like kitty carlisle who plays the leading lady in the show gertrude michael as the deep eyed villianess gives an interesting if rather fictional portrayal jack oakie as the stage manager is the same old wisecracking jack but we wouldn't change him jessie ralph is excellent as the seamstress others in the cast are charles middleton gail patrick donald meek barbara fritchie toby wing and lona andre the screen play is by carey wilson and rufus king and the direction by mitchell leisen the music is by arthur johnstone and the lyrics by sam coslow in addition to murder at the vanities there is a mickey mouse cartoon a paramount newsreel and a two reeler the wrong direction br br i disagree with lolly on the denouement it's satisfying if over the top why would she blame the director was she displeased with the story's ending or the way it was staged and what's a ten twenty or thirty show note the swipe taken at busby berkeley and his overhead shots as hard as it may be to believe today the public was tiring of buzz' schtick by may 1934 mitch leisen said if you are showing a stage show that's supposed to be in a theater you should stay within the bounds of the proscenium arch and not do a buzz berkeley routine with a stage set that's acres big br br q don't you think berkeley's spectacular effects justified taking this liberty ml apparently they did because they're reviving all of his pictures and none of mine but personally i don't like it
<START> honestly this is the best reality show anyone has ever come up with in order to win the money you have to actually be intelligent not only that you've got to be brave athletic cunning etc it actually requires skill not like some lame ass shows that are on these days and yet they only have two seasons of it bull they need to bring this show back br br although they'll have a hard time pulling anderson cooper away from cnn he was great br br but seriously it was an amazing show you never knew who would be going when and it was so much fun trying to figure out the mole yourself it was a show you could actually play yourself if you wanted to br br bring back the mole bring back the mole
