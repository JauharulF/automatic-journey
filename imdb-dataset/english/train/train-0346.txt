<START> i did not intend to write this review but having read the default review that shows up on this movie's url i felt compelled to write a rebuttal the movie in a word is superlative it does not deserve the slanderous review that the writer has written i think the writer has totally missed the point of the movie to a large extent in fact i too was turned off by the excessive show of evangelist devotions that occupied the middle of the movie to a large extent however i must beg to differ with the reviewer in that this movie in the end is not a propaganda piece for evangelist action i think what the director has shown is that how religion is not enough to find all the answers how religion is to a large extent incapable of providing answers to basic simple questions that one may ask and all that religion has to offer is sometimes just banal platitudes of one kind or another this does not demonstrate a value judgment on religion as we have to remember that religion is transmuted and expressed by ordinary mostly well meaning basically good people and they usually have no monopoly on truth and thus religion can not in the end provide the ultimate answers to some questions in life ultimately it is a matter of faith you have to take it on faith and that's all and if you are given to faith then you can appreciate any show of faith and if you are not given to faith then any show of faith is tiresome it is thus at the same time instructive to note the reviewer reaction to the movie in any case the director shows us that one can choose not to accept the religious interpretation of events and answers to questions and in spite of that life goes on and there are 'secret sunshine' in this world that awaits all wounded souls regardless of their religious orientation and that's just the core message of the film please note the last scene of the movie if you don't get this in the end the movie is a great one and very thought provoking and confronts you the viewer with questions that you have to answer for yourself thus it is a work of art that is challenging to you personally i do agree with the reviewer in that the evangelical stuff was a bit too much however given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie i think the director was trying to balance the act whereby he might not be called an evangelist Â basher the actor kang ho song was great as always he's so balanced and just perfect that he's just amazing he's my favorite korean actor no doubt i know the actress do yeon jeon got the cannes award for best actress for this movie however i did not find any specialty in her acting it seems that to get awards you just have to act really convincingly in crying and hysterical scenes and allÂ all in all a great movie if you don't like it Â please watch it again and see if you get it if it leaves you dissatisfied or uncomfortable or asking questions then think if that was not what the director was actually aiming at through this movie in the first place
<START> anyone who is a sucker for 1920s jazz 1920s dress the charleston and ultra swanky yachts e g me on all counts will want to like this movie but the sad fact is that that's all there is the plot is banal and obvious the acting mostly either awful or playing to the farcical side of the goings on and when the whole thing's over there is not much left but the impression of mirrors and smoke this is a beautifully made bad movie
<START> this is one of the most hateful and cruel movies i've seen in a long time sadly i was duped into sticking with it since donald sutherland's presence misleadingly gave it some credibility that's the last time that'll happen br br lesley ann warren's character was annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come there were smarter characters than hers who were killed in the film thats just one of many things in this movie that made me ask where is the justice br br why is late night cable so filled with sadistic garbage filled with pathological mayhem most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women and seem to focus on them being terrorized and murdered this film could have been every bit as suspenseful without being sick and twisted in the process all it ends up doing is turning the viewer's stomach with its sickness and insulting the viewer's intelligence br br the cast is misleadingly good my guess is that they bagged sutherland first and used him to lure the others like lemmings into this br br i'm kicking myself for wasting time giving this piece of garbage a chance
<START> my god what's going on a uwe boll film and positive comments wow br br nice to note that most of the positive reviews are coming from newbies to boll's work i myself as i have stated in previous uwe boll reviews only watch his films in the hope that one day he will actually make something good i mean it must happen one day br br alas seed is not that day i don't quite know where to start with the lame attempt at a horror film that seed is the thing to remember people is that all the sickos in the world are that way due to having watched various sick acts on video or the net or so mr boll believes i still can't for the life of me figure out why footage of real animal abuse and killings was needed in the first 10 minutes of this film i understand the concept that seed the killer is a sicko and enjoys watching such stuff but can't understand why mr boll thought putting real footage in the film would work maybe to shock us hmmm well i for one am not squeamish and can handle seeing anything on film i don't though find the use of real animal cruelty footage entertaining in the slightest if you were trying to shock me it didn't work it just reminded me how messed up the world was because such things happen and also because uwe boll is allowed to continue making films this sort of context may have worked for films in the 70 80's cannibal holocaust but not todays market br br with that out of the way we can move on to the fact that uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap feel all round like bloodrayne 2 you can just tell that there wasn't a huge amount of money floating around for production br br as per usual mr boll does not really care for making a decent story as we are treated to boring shots of police officers watching various videos of seed's victims in the first 25 mins each of these videos ends in a speeded up decomp of the victim it's all very boring and tedious i won't comment on the toddler scene as it's laughable and just another cheap 'shock' factor br br if you manage to sit through the first 25 mins then you will be treated to the police officers walking through a very dark house in order to catch seed the lighting here is horrible and uwe has the old 'i'm not using a steady cam' fiasco that he did with bloodrayne 2 watch as the police officers die in ever stupidly increasing ways until such point as seed is caught this scene is soooo bloody stupid you have to see it to believe it the cop actually tells seed he could have shot him for some un be known reason the cop doesn't shoot him given that seed is a sicko that kills kids as well as adults you'd have thought at this point in the script that sense would prevail br br from here we are treated to a stupid execution scene followed by the cops burying seed alive and they know he is alive why not shoot him in the head followed by seed getting out of the ground and then killing some random woman with a hammer and then kidnapping the one of the cop's family br br what i'm trying to get across to you all here is that it's just plain stupid it's not even hollywood horror stupid just plain dumb uwe boll can not direct anyone with any ounce of taste would agree with that statement anyone who watches this film and found it entertaining in any way shape or form needs to take a serious look at themselves as a person br br once again we are treated to a poorly acted directed lighted produced scripted piece of ub crap
<START> wow this film had a huge impact on me it moved me it is an amazing story about a girl in cambodia who is sold into the sex trade i can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named holly the setting of the film is realistic the film was an eye opener i can not imagine anyone walking away from it with out wanting to help make a change with this horrifying problem that exsists br br the content of the film was very very moving it was one of the best films that i have seen this year the br br girl who plays holly does a fantastic job with her character ron livinston gives a fantastic performance the film moved me to tears it tells an important message that needs to be heard worldwide everyone should go see this film i think this film will make a difference i loved it
<START> i probably saw this movie first in about 1995 since then i've returned to it many times it's great i especially like the first and second clips creation and civilization rising wow this was so cool back in the glory days of cg animation cg is way older than i am as i know the film tron was made 7 years before my time but this film was a landmark in the early '90s it was probably the first collaboration of different cg experiments set to music i like it so much i think i'll go watch it now bye
<START> god bless 80's slasher films this is a fun fun movie this is what slasher films are all about now i'm not saying horror movies just slasher films it goes like this a high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid jocks and cheerleaders and then one of their pranks goes horribly wrong disfigured and back for revenge sporting a joker jester mask pretty creepy looking might i add marty begins to kill off those teens one by one many years later after he manages to make them believe that their old abandoned high school is having a reunion that is basically the plot what's wrong with that that's the beauty of 80's slasher films most of them i would say a lot of things could be so ridiculous but they keep drawing you more in an' in as they go by especially this film br br it features some outrageous killings and some are quite creative as well poisoning of a beer can acid bath i can't remember a javelin ever being used before in any other slasher film either it really is a fun fun movie that's all it is nevermind the fact that the characters are complete idiots never mind their stupidity and never mind the outrageous random things that occur in this film such as lights being able to be controlled by the killer when he's not even switching any buttons you'll see and toilets being able to cough up blood baths being able to have acid come out of them just use that as part of your entertainment because thats what really makes it entertaining br br movies like this represent 80's slashers never again could movies like this get made know why it isn't the 80's anymore that is why you should just cherish them for what they are good fun i highly recommend this film if you're a hardcore fan of slahsers such as friday the 13th br br one last note this movie also had a kick ass villain as well marty rantzen a disfigured nerd who kills all his old foes in a creepy jester mask a good villain makes a good slasher simon scuddamore who played marty apparently committed suicide shortly after slaughter high was released that alone adds something creepy to the film and sticks with it and it even makes you feel more sorry for the marty character i guess all in all great 80's slashers fun it's a shame it will never be the same again
<START> this is a quirky little movie and i have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well br br it follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous las vegas illusionist and is partly about following his dream partly about the dreams of others and all about the travails of showbiz i thought the movie was charming and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhile br br alan arkin is terrific as the magician who never was and his mentoring of max makes for a funny and touching relationship br br not for everyone probably but if you like movies about the journey then i think you'll like this one
<START> i loved this film i thought it would be easy to watch and easy to forget i ran out after watching this to buy the dvd obv not easily forgotten br br the script is brilliant and the casting couldn't be more perfect each character has their moment and i laughed hard throughout this film comedic timing was spot on br br
<START> spoilers spoilers juggernaut is a british made thriller released in the us by first national karloff is dr sartorius who has to leave his research because his funds have dried up karloff is forced to retreat to france and start up a medical practice he is propositioned by a conniving woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband she knows karloff needs the money br br karloff agrees to the proposition and soon becomes the personal doctor of the husband all the while the wife is prancing about town with the local no good playboy karloff finally injects the old geyser with poison and he kicks off however his son from another marriage arrives a few days before the killing and finds out the will has been changed when he spills the beans to the wife she goes berserk and even bites the son's hand br br meanwhile karloff's nurse has misplaced the hypo karloff used to kill the old man when karloff finds out he isn't getting any money he asks the wife to poison the son the nurse suspects karloff and finds the missing hypo analysis shows poison but not quite in time as karloff kidnaps the nurse br br to make a long story short the nurse escapes gets the police and manages to save the son who is about to be injected by karloff karloff instead injects himself and dies br br this movie does have some good points karloff is possessed and plays the type of mad doctor he did in the devil commands and the man who lived again it is peculiar however to see him walk around stiffly and slightly hunched over we never find out why he is walking this way i suspect the director thought it made him more sinister br br the actress playing the 2 timing wife overacts something terrible she has a french accent even though she overacts badly you still manage to hate her or maybe you hate her because of her acting br br a little below average for a karloff vehicle if you buy the sinister cinema vhs copy the audio is a bit choppy
<START> i liked this show a lot we got the first and only it would appear series in the uk on channel 4 the characterisation was right on the money a bit like the simpsons in that all the different facets of small town populace were represented br br there was no laughter track i hadn't seen this on an american tv comedy at the time except for on larry sanders and it really worked well here heightening the suggestion that these wacky cops were really like that and not just hamming it up for the cameras br br all in all a quirky little number that tickled me just right i can't help but think that maybe it missed it's mark with certain audiences i think it would have been a cult hit in the uk had it been shown at an acceptable hour br br i'll round this off with my standard comment where the hell can i get hold of this to watch it again any ideas
<START> picture the fugly annoying goth kids from college in a scat film throw in a pinch of story and a whole lot of awful acting and you are still not even close to how bad this movie is br br shot badly bad effects worse acting contrived attempt at shocking horror everyone i've showed this to gets kinda depressed watching it the sex scenes are disturbing not necessarily for their content but more because they're just something you want to end as soon as possible the last sex scene is just foul even before she gets to the guy br br i'm one of those people that loves to watch movies that people hate which is why i picked this one up but for your own sake save yourself the time and avoid this abhorrence it's that bad i literally threw it in the garbage
<START> the hazing is one of them films i always wanted to see solely based on the illustrated cover image here on imdb yes that's how shallow i am i don't care if ten million people call it a crap movie the poster looks awesome so i guess i'll just have to see it Â now the hazing can somewhat be described like its alternate title curious the poster and title make it sound like a genuine horror movie set on campus and dealing with sinister initiation rites but this movie is actually more of a crossbreed between comedy and thriller first of all there's something very wrong with the tagline on the old vhs box i watched it says he had good grades a good girl and good buddies Â until they put him through the hazing that's not the case actually protagonist gilbert lewis is finally accepted by an acclaimed campus through an athletics scholarship it takes over half the movie before we even hear about his girlfriend back home and the only buddy he has is a very nerdy charles martin smith still with hair in this film both of them are approached to become members of the prestigious delts fraternity but during their hazing exam Â in which they have to descend a mountain dressed in their tidy white undies Â barney falls off a cliff and breaks his leg when lewis returns with the other frat boys barney froze to death already together they intended to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim he never returned from a weekend ski trip with barney's body hidden in the cafeteria freezer lewis has to cover for him so that barney's absence doesn't look suspicious the set up of the hazing is quite original and potentially innovative but the problem here is that the execution could easily have been a lot better the tone is too steady and too serious for a comedy movie even a black one but on the other hand there aren't any proper attempts to build up suspense or thrills neither the soundtrack is cheerful and full of light headed tunes but that's nearly not enough to make this film a comedy around an hour into the film the plot also runs out of steam and idea and the makers have no better alternative to fill up the emptiness with romantic compilations of lewis and his outer town girlfriend biking through the countryside i didn't like the final twist because it's quite implausible and because it has been done numerous times before and after though admittedly after the hazing is not a complete waste of time but still i'm glad i found an ex rental tape at a friend's house instead of having to spend any money on the recently released dvd
<START> 90 minutes of mindy mindy is a tease to boyfriend bill mindy prances at the high school dance mindy hitchhikes to big sur shoplifts a loaf of shepherd's bread mindy nearly gets gang raped ah the pleasures of crown international drive in features you must remember that these films were never designed to be watched start to finish on dvd players they were made as 90 minutes of ambiance so the teens of the 70s would have a soundtrack as they got it on in their pintos and citations the lack of pacing and structure didn't matter to the original audience they probably only tuned in when the t a on screen matched what they were up to out in the parking lot the film is really irritating when watched as a story it's a lot more fun to talk about it than watch it my favorite inanities 1 bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find mindy with no luggage or change of underwear they spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher just like in real life 2 after being abducted and nearly raped by depraved bikers and after their innocent friend pan is savagely beaten mindy and her girlfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road mindy immediately brightens up and chirps i'm going' to big sur but again it's a lot more fun to talk read about than sit through
<START> this movie was just heckled by mst3k and with good reason first and foremost because it is a cop movie starring joe don baker who we all know is about as good a cop actor as michael jackson is a country western singer br br all the typical cop movie plot devices rear their ugly heads bar fights children hostages in shoot outs bad acting lame police chiefs bad acting revenge justice endless goons and of course bad acting don't watch this without an mst3k filter folks
<START> love rosario dawson think she's one of the finest actresses of the modern era br br descent seems to be more about self empowerment than anything else it's the consistent undertone in everything in the film the dialog is flat the characters seemingly intentionally bland and one sided the only consistency is the representation of self empowerment in the characters and rosario's journey from self empowerment to loss of empowerment and back again br br pitching this as a rape classic isn't appropriate and that's probably why so many people don't enjoy the film the standard 'rape' audience wouldn't particularly like this film and maybe that's the point the film asks more questions than it answers and it does confront it's target audience whether they like it or not there's a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the film doesn't slap the audience across the face with self righteous audacity it does engage the viewer for what may or may not be all the wrong reasons br br descent is a good film which imho is severely under rated
<START> couldn't go to sleep the other night so i got up flipped on the tube this movie was on br br film makers bit off more than they could chew just as ambitious in scope as forrest gump was but gump read like an fairy tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era tgmb just relies on tired clichÃ©s to tell the story almost like a broadway musical where actors have to ham it up every character's purpose was to fill a silly 60's archetype br br take how we're introduced to finnegan hugging his black maid receiving a framed picture of mlk criminey talk about heavy handed why not just give him a t shirt saying i heart black people br br sunshine isn't free love groovay man oh no i didn't have my period br br mary beth i want to go to berkeley not square ucla uh excuse me there was nothing square about la in the 60s rather than take the time to demonstrate what made berkeley unique we just hear this brat whine about not going there br br can't even remember the black kid's name he was just a prop used to show how racially tolerant the other kids are br br thing is period pieces don't have to be this cheesy take dazed confused look how we're introduced to the football hero randall floyd we don't first see him on the football field in fact we never see him play football we're introduced to him in class inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a party br br in dazed feminism isn't a casual by product of some chick getting knocked up it's much more organic more serious than that it's refined in the ladies' room over a flip discussion about gilligan's island serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings but real life is like that br br some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant i agree which is why i feel so disappointed by this piece of baby boomer pornostalgia
<START> slashers 2 outta 5 stars br br not really a very good movie but i did like the idea behind it and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with the movie is ostensibly an episode of a live japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off danger zone and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them the survivor if there is one wins fame and fortune everyone else just winds up dead the main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad none of the real people seem real at all the actors playing the killers are kind of fun because they are portraying cheesy and over the top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types and that's exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show the movie pretends to be done all in one take there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the danger zone and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly to hide the cuts from one take to another i would imagine
<START> after seeing only half of the film in school back in november today i saw that it was on flix channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and to write a new review on it br br the book that the film is based on hatchet is ok this is a terrible adaption of it though br br awful and i mean awful acting bad dialogue and average cinematography make up this terrible adaption of hatchet br br the film starts off brian who is the clichÃ© image of a late 80s teen sporting a mullet banging his head to cheap 80s rock music and his mother driving in a car for him to get on a plane to fly up to see his estranged dad his parents are divorced now cue the dramatic pause now brian has said goodbye to mom and dog and is flying up to see his father the pilot is a fat ugly rude man wasn't like that in the book who after 2 minutes in the air has a heart attack and dies in the book it goes into more detail with the pilot having more pains and it seemed to be that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack br br the plane within another two minutes has gone empty on fuel leaving us the viewers to assume that he's been up there for hours even though the sun hasn't changed position and the scenery looks exactly the same now's he's crashed landed br br this is the point in the movie where everything is a lot different then it was in the book in the book it said his jacket was torn to shreds but in the movie it is perfectly fine with no tears or rips looks like he just bought it it never said he climbed a mountain saw a wolf and fell asleep up there on the mountain it never said he was attacked by a bear it said a moose but not a bear it never said he eats the several bugs that he does it never mentions the second tornado or that he learned to get those sparrows skin them and eat them or that little fish farm trap that he makes that is destroyed by one of the tornadoes nor does it mention him hurting his ribs from one of the tornadoes br br i don't even think you can call what was depicted in the film a tornado all it was was just a windstorm that knocked down several of his things br br my favorite part of this camp fest was brian's lame flashbacks that are never mentioned in the book especially the clichÃ© scene of brian waking up walking over to the window and seeing his dad with all of his things packed that can all perfectly fit into just the back of his truck leaving and screams daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaddddddddd yet of course his father didn't hear him even though he was just right outside and he punches his fist through the window wtf br br the ending is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book i said close in the book i think one of the key things that the rescue pilot said to brian when he landed was you're the kid who they've been looking for they stopped months ago yet they left that line out in the movie br br there's a pathetic epilogue with brian somehow without counseling or therapy getting back to normal with his family i think we were supposed to assume that they were getting together for thanksgiving because they had a turkey on the counter then it shows his temporary home for what in the movie seemed like three days but in the book was for several months and his hatchet still in a tree where he left it also didn't happen in the book showing where he carved a message so perfectly done home where we really supposed to believe that he carved that that perfectly with just that hatchet br br no quote can sum this movie up better then when enid from ghost world said this is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again perfect description of this movie br br i wouldn't recommend it to somebody who hasn't read the book and are just looking to watch a movie nor would i to somebody who has read the book because they'll be disappointed and bored to death br br for those who have read the book leave what your imagination created as the movie this is awful and will bring down your thoughts on the book br br 1 10
<START> since this is part 2 then compering it to part one br br man that was on many places wierd too many time jumps etc br br i have to say that i was really disapointed br br only someplaces little lame action and thats it br br they could have done that better br br
