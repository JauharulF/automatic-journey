<START> stargate sg 1 follows and expands upon the egyptian mythologies presented in stargate in the stargate universe humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the goa'uld such as ra and apophis for millennia the goa'uld harvested humanity heavily influencing and spreading human cultures as a result earth cultures such as those of the aztecs mayans britons the norse mongols greeks and romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy many well known mythical locations such as avalon camelot and atlantis are found or have at one time existed br br presently the earth stargate found at a dig site near giza in 1928 is housed in a top secret u s military base known as the sgc stargate command underneath cheyenne mountain col jack o'neill anderson dr daniel jackson shanks capt samantha carter tapping and teal'c judge compose the original sg 1 team a few characters join and or leave the team in later seasons along with 24 other sg teams they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the goa'uld in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races br br the parasitic goa'uld use advanced technology to cast themselves as egyptian gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship throughout the first eight seasons the goa'uld are the primary antagonists they are a race of highly intelligent ruthless snake like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species including humans the original arch enemy from this race was the system lord apophis peter williams other system lords such as baal and anubis play pivotal roles in the later seasons in the ninth season a new villain emerges the ori the ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship the introduction of the ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on egyptian mythology into an exploration of the arthurian mythology surrounding the ori their followers and their enemiesÂthe ancients
<START> this is indeed a god adaptation of jane austen's novel compared with the american version with guinneth paltrow the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book but the acting was awful besides kate beckinsale who i believe was a true likeness of the emma in the book all the other actors were trying too hard mark strong was not the gentleman he was supposed to be he was often rude and offensive had no feeling whatsoever and throughout the entire film you could not see his love growing for emma at all this had a terrible effect on kate beckinsale who seemed to be trying to resque her leading role as well as her partner's moreover there was no chemistry between the entire cast hariett smith played by samantha morton seemed to have no real attachment to mr elton played by dominic rowan therefore she did not seem as heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book the settings of the film are also too poor the costumes are even more so i would have imagined emma woodhouse to dress in a more fashionable and elegant way that she does here the ending is also too long it is good that it resembles the book's ending but it is a killer ending for a film and again i can see no feeling of happiness in the face of mr knightley to conclude i believed this adaptation to be loyal to the book but with poor actors it seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all i would prefer to see the lighter version with paltrow and northam even if it is clear that it was made to be a blockbuster than to watch these actors excepting the good olivia williams and the better kate beckinsale ruin the entire script
<START> i've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is life sometimes has boring patches no real plot and not necessarily a happy ending a river runs through it is the perfect name for this film and norman maclean's novel life ebbs and flows like a river and it has it's rough spots but it is a wonderful trip br br robert redford brings a lot to the film his narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly as a director he is restrained and calm and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes as for the acting craig sheffer and brad pitt work surprising well as brothers i don't know quite how to describe tom skerritt and brenda blethyn's performances except that they truly feel real a river runs through it is a wonderful film br br 8 6 out of 10
<START> the comparison is perhaps unfair but inevitable those attracted to the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut and paste musical in the american style awkward stilted dialogue with inexplicable song and dance numbers gene kelly's french accent was apparently so poor that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted as you'll remember the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in umbrellas the translation of the french for subtitled versions as well leaves something to be desired although this can't be attributed to demy the film also has several self aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting such as references in songs to legrand himself and the costumes well the tight pants white boots combination and the freakishly unnatural colors reminds one of an austin powers film br br but demy does reward the viewer with allusions to umbrellas note for instance the suitcase carried by maxence in his departure from rochefort this is the same suitcase carried by guy in his departure from cherbourg also note the convenient brunette of resolution madeleine in umbrellas and josette in young girls br br generally speaking those expecting the natural feel of umbrellas save the floating bicycle scene or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in umbrella's script should probably pass this one b y those looking for a french version of a thin '60s american musical will be quite happy
<START> the three main characters are very well portrayed especially anisio by rock musician turned into first time actor paulo miklos he is extremely convincing as the lower class trespasser invader the film shows very well the snowball effect of getting involved in ever more shady business the contrast and similarities between the lower and higher classes how everyone gets carried away by greed and ambition 9 9 5 out of 10
<START> this movie is about sexual obsession bette davis plays mildred this is a woman who men are drawn to not because she is a nice beautiful girl but because she is a sexual entity now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious there is a scene in the movie in which men are all going googly eyes over her she works as a waitress in a coffee shop she can't read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt it is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her one day phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her he starts buying her things even pays for her apartment meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it he dreams about her like she is a angel but she is no angel he is constantly thinking about her his med school grades are even failing so what the nookie is too good he wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy she always lets phil know she really doesn't have love feelings for him all of time he is heart broken but he meets another woman they seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the bimbo mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed phillip takes her in again but she starts going out with a friend of his the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out she does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him well it doesn't work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up oh we have a club foot that he has problems about even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it he meets another girl named sally we have a march of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for mildred well he has no school tuition can't find a job finally sally and her dad takes him in not before another march of time montage showing him going downhill soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor meanwhile he finds mildred needs him again she has tb meanwhile he is still leading sally down the primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship finally the bimbo dies and phillip declares he is free now and he will marry sally i wished she told him to stuff it now i know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points but i feel phillip was the bad guy yes mildred is a strumpet but he knows it and he keeps coming back mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers i guess the sex wasn't as good but in any case he dogs those women waiting for mildred not only that but the man who gets mildred pregnant is already married and when philip asks him what he intends to do about baby apparently the baby's name he laughs is off he has no intention in supporting her and baby and he is wealthy sally's father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist philip doesn't seem to refute his feelings either men are using mildred as a boy toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain to me it is philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for mildred
<START> although there are some snippets in this 4 part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform these are not very well developed in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs br br although this program as a whole leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money and for that it deserves some praise almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you if asked they think the drug war is designed to solve for example while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80's at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business but instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame inexplicably alcohol prohibition the violence that ensued and the subsequent reversal of prohibition is totally ignored by this program br br this program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war the possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems but not all users do their drugs in excess just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics br br if you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science has decided to totally prohibit whose users it has decided to not so metaphorically wage war against just forget about it none of that is in here br br on the other hand this is hardly in the category of anti drug propaganda it is mostly an interesting neutrally presented history of drugs in 20th century united states like marijuana lsd heroin cocaine mdma and oxycontin but there is a significant element of various people's points of view with regard to drug laws and most but not all of that is not very thoughtful or well informed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana br br the criminal justice system along with its often harsh life ruining penalties is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem but unfortunately there's an epidemic in this nation of an as yet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs a lack of compassion for fellow humans a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentally approved perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison policing industry and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity it's morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason this is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs yet this program ignores it br br so in sum the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining but when it comes to presenting a rational non radical point of view with regard to drug policy and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives it's pretty disappointing
<START> adrian has just gone out of the asylum being rich and with no parents his life seems empty one day he meets gonzalo a poor boy whom mother is prostitute desperate for earning some money gonzalo helps adrian to search about his life and who where his parents this is a movie from a new director and it is perfectly clear in most of the film scenes not correctly directed dialogues a little forced some incoherences in the script anyway the ending is unexpectedly well done well just a little and that saves a little the film actors are known and with great quality nevertheless they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting all of them have done better papers in other film the film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends of course there are lots of worse films but sure there are many many better ones
<START> before i begin i want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved including whittaker who indeed deserves his nomination it is highly entertaining and taken in the right context as a work of fiction it is a very good movie for that i give it the two stars br br however rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere i want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth i stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character dr nicholas garrigan is a complete invention of fiction rather it presents this character into a real historical setting and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real and what they are seeing is the truth i have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction but to do so in such a dishonest matter is in a word reprehensible br br there can be no doubt that africa along with most third world countries is rife with human misery and suffering hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film but hollywood also has its eye toward making money the only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the west is to either experience it for yourself or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary br br but these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much at the end of the day they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming see we told you it was bad the seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the dvd after sitting through the movie arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of kay amin idi's second wife whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity in the film we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse arms for legs and vice versa this is the director making sure you understand that amin is as the gungans say bom bad but watching the documentary we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth which the sitting minister of health at the time himself tells us is not true br br so what they just make up these things why because hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence that's why they don't trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves look that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media we don't need this texas chainsaw massacre inspired imagery to reinforce that and this is just the tip of the iceberg what is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character garrigan is himself fictional there was no young scottish doctor taken under amin's wing as such garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb westerners understand the african world the producers seem to thing we won't be interested in a film about africa unless there is a white face in it ironically even the titular character is portrayed by an american black actor the problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of amin and his regime but instead an exploitative thriller about a white westerner coming to africa for all the wrong reasons making several horrible mistakes and then redeeming himself even at the cost of three other innocent lives honestly i have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of mrs amin was the result of a tryst with a fictional scottish doctor it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment i really wish hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money i first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative a beautiful mind ron howard and akiva goldsman's sugary sweet adaptation of the life of john nash which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that america just can't get enough of the sad truth is that hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years and viewers who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves buy these fake portraits hook line and sinker br br look i'm certainly not suggesting amin is being turned into a villain he wasn't my point is with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man why must hollywood then go to such fictional lengths why must hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films why can they not trust us to think for ourselves can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves i urge all who continue to watch hollywood's purportedly true movies to do yourself the favor of always investigating for yourself and to never assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth
<START> like all carnosaur movies this is a joke the way the dinosaurs move reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls because they cannot be any stiffer or more fake looking than they were br br the plot had no sense whatsoever i mean first they're on a bus then in a warehouse then all of a sudden they're on a boat and let's be serious does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van or on a ship i thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals and now they can fit on a moving van it sounds stupid even when you think about it br br the only reason for which i gave this a 3 is because it's still entertaining i found it better than the first one haven't watched the second yet just don't rent it i saw it on tv and it's a good thing i did because i wouldn't have wanted to waste money renting it
<START> after citizen kane in 1941 hollywood executives turned their cob webbed backs on the great orson welles with the exception of kane welles lost all creative control on magnificent ambersons journey into fear and many other films to come welles was an innovative and creative genius the most unconventional of filmmakers when hollywood was in need of a few more the lady from shanghai is yet another example of the misunderstood view of welles' films at the time a movie that seems a bit choppy and non fluent it has a conventional 1940's premise told in a most unconventional way and i am sure some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor it is now legend that columbia mogul harry cohn stood up during its initial screening and asked what it was about in hindsight many old grumps that ran the studios back then had not one clue as to the cinematic techniques and master story telling of orson welles and the lady from shanghai is only nearly great because of their intrusion br br beside being arguably the greatest director of all time welles was also quite a performer as an actor at 25 we all know what he did as charles foster kane perhaps the most famous character in film history here he inhabits a rare character of dim wit and not much intelligence something unfamiliar to those familiar with welles other great work instead of a slick wise tongue he speaks with a rough irish twang rita hayworth his unhappily married wife at the time plays an unhappily married wife of a lawyer who puts welles in a spell and is able to draw him into a job that will take him to the limits of deception and disillusionment he is a large lug who may have even murdered a man but the real mystery lies in the relationship between hayworth with stunning blonde hair and crippled hubby everett sloane mr bernstein from citizen kane a creepy partner of sloane's is along for the sail around the country to set off a number of peculiar events that has welles' michael o'hara head spinning welles narrates the picture as o'hara but things are still unclear throughout see for yourself and realize that it takes at least 2 viewings to fully know exactly what's up br br an uncharacteristically strange courtroom sequence centers around o'hara with sloane defending him it is an oddly comedic scene with some quirky courtroom methods including sloane cross examining himself i didn't really laugh here because the film stalls at this point after a first portion that never gets to take off anyway up to this point the cinematography is great some scenes are shot with craft and skill aquarium love scene but there is no distinct line drawing the elements and us the audience in reportedly the court scene was re shot against welles' requests 10 closeups of hayworth were ordered and a makeshift song sung by the starlet was thrown in at cohn's insistence a gaudy score infuriated welles who once again was left out of the editing process thank welles himself for saving the film entirely with a tour de force ending that will always be treasured the so called hall of mirrors scene brings buffs back time and time again rightfully so br br it must be seen to be believed and it does a good job of wrapping up some confusing ideas presented the crash of the mirrors represents o'hara's disillusionment and the crazy house itself is a masterpiece of art and set decoration it seems more like a state of mind than an actual place and is indeed crazy twisted and turned like a dali painting this is a great ending to a flawed picture that if left alone would probably have made the afi's top 100 then again 3 or 4 more of orson welles films may have made all collective best of lists if he had been left alone to create his own magic br br note look for the mercury players that are so prominent in welles pictures they pop up all over rating 8 of 10
<START> apparently there's a very good reason why i never heard about dr hackenstein before me and a couple of mates accidentally stumbled upon it and stupidly decided to give it a chance that reason is it sucks it's a very pointless dull imbecilic and totally unmemorable horror comedy parody actually to be honest i'm not even sure if this was meant as a comedy because sometimes the script takes itself quite seriously and tries really hard to be a really ambitious and original late 80's horror effort in the year 1909 at the dawn of a new era in medical science according to the opening sequences dr elliot hackenstein needs exactly three women Â no more no less Â to refurbish his beloved wife whom he accidentally killed she's only just a living head left now but the stupid body snatchers only provide male cadavers so when dr hackenstein yells out i need three female bodies to bring back my wife his words aren't even cold and there just miraculously appear three young females and one really annoying nerdy kid with car trouble show up at his doorstep why doesn't that ever happen to me i need a bunch of sexy voluptuous women to fill up my empty harem Â see nothing anyway the good doctor sees his wish fulfilled but unfortunately Â for science that is Â he develops sympathy for one of the three girls dr hackenstein is a lame film that tries to cash in on the success of re animator and even blatantly steal some of the comical aspects of that classic like a severed head talking one liners it's easy to see why this film is never mentioned anywhere as it doesn't appeal to fans of neither the horror nor the comedy genre the funniest character is undoubtedly the loud speaking female grave robber ruby depicted by the anti cherubic anne ramsey 80's horror buffs will certainly remember her from wes craven's deadly friend where she played the nasty old hag neighbor who gets decapitated by a basketball dr hackenstein supposedly takes place in the early 1900's but there are hardly any attempts to re create the atmosphere of that era except maybe for some automobiles dr hackenstein's laboratory is a quite clichÃ©d 80's set piece with all sorts of smoky cauldrons and test tubes full of fluorescent colors
<START> this has to be one of the best if not the best film i have seen for a very very long time had enough action to satisfy an fan and yet the plot was very good i really enjoyed the film and had me hooked from start to finish br br added blood and gore in there but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film and even had a tear jerker ending for many people i should think br br it is a must watch for anyone seen many reviews slating the film but to be fair most the films that get bad reviews turn out to be some of the best this proves it once again br br rent this film buy this film just go out and watch this film you will not be disappointed
<START> i have to start off by apologizing because i thought the first 75 80 of this film was hilarious it's mostly because of brad pitt's performance spot on br br the acting by all involved was quite good but brad stole the movie the atmosphere was perfect in all respects i'm not a giant pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles ever br br brutal honest gritty all good words to describe this movie br br i was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind early's violence isn't explained it is explained but they thankfully don't have to go into graphic detail to get their point across br br overall i gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective i think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie underrated
<START> i've got a question for those who thought of this idea why what made them think to make a second movie of this if memory serves didn't cinderella end with they all lived happily ever after i'm pretty sure it did or it was implied wait a minute if they all lived happily ever after how could there be a sequel unless they were trying to make the most boring story in history there couldn't be a sequel i mean sure they could have cinderella singing about nonsense for two hours but why a movie that ends in happily ever after can not have a sequel if it does then they don't live happily ever after something's got to go wrong which causes problems with the first ending why that's not right it's evil that's my final word on the matter
<START> legend of dragoon is one of those little known games that people either love or hate some people claim it's far too similar to other games namely the final fantasy series which is understandable since it was originally intended to be sony's equivalent of final fantasy honestly i can't comment on the similarities beyond that as i'm not very familiar with the ff games br br i think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful dragoon form but every time you attack you have to pay attention in order to complete the attack by pressing buttons at the correct time not only that sometimes enemies will attack you back right in the middle of a sequence which means you have to press different buttons in order to avoid taking damage even the use of certain attack items requires a bit of button mashing if you don't want to attack you can always guard which not only cuts any damage taken in half but raises your hit points without the use of healing potions br br the fmvs are quite well done about the same quality as final fantasy 8's however the graphics during game play aren't quite up to that standard they're nice but they could have been and honestly should have been better the translation as well leaves something to be desired not only does it raise interesting character relationship questions but there are also some grammatical mistakes that simply shouldn't have been allowed to pass br br another thing i found interesting was that you lose main party characters one dies and the other basically becomes useless to the party and leaves while the death of the one character is often said to have no point it makes you realize early on that the characters while heroes are still just as mortal as the next person the people who replace the lost characters simply gain all their stats so the transition game play wise is fairly smooth perhaps my one complaint about the characters is the main character's love interest shana she is the epitome of the helpless female in need of rescuing pathetic to the point of driving a player to screaming with frustration while you can use her in your party she is insanely weak i don't even know what her dragoon powers are like as i disliked her so much i never used her the character rose by contrast is probably my favorite female character in any game ever she's no wimp and some of her dragoon magic is extremely useful meru is quite strong as well while sometimes being an annoying talkative brat br br the character designers were as most are inclined to make the female characters appear pretty or whatever and didn't give much thought to the actual usefulness of the outfits seriously no armor and having most of your skin exposed is not helpful when fighting monsters but i will give them props as they do have females serving as knights in the various countries br br i can't comment much on the plot as honestly i didn't pay much attention to it beyond where i needed to go to next i'm not sure if this says something about the plot itself or my gaming style br br all in all it's a very enjoyable game it has its flaws but for me it struck just the right balance of having to think and just pressing buttons and killing monsters
<START> iowa wants to be requiem for a dream for midwest meth but it comes across as a hard r rated reefer madness br br yes drugs are bad and meth is horribly pernicious as an addiction and how it destroys people families and communities but these characters who are either dumb or ridiculous and the eye rolling plot won't teach that lesson to anyone br br while writer director star matt farnsworth has some charisma on screen his partner diane foster plays a wincibly silly wide eyed innocent corrupted by drugsas was already satirized by susan sarandon in the rocky horror picture show i really felt sorry for her for all the totally unnecessary nudity she was put through it wasn't until the end of the film that i realized i was supposed to think these two were recent high school graduates to explain some of their naivetÃ© as we are bombarded by their school photos but if so they even looked older than the folks on the o c while they have good chemistry on screen they are a pale imitation of a badlands type couple br br the guest stars are badly used michael t weiss who was so good in tv's the pretender is completely ludicrous as a corrupt parole officer and his brutal violence is just plain crazy as his character pretty much ruins any social significance for the film rosanna arquette has to be even sleazier than she rolled around for david cronenberg as a very low rent livia soprano john savage even has to mouth the old baby boomer excuses about i did pot but this is worse a goth chick shows up with the odd explanation that she's a stripper from des moines the obligatory latino drug dealer appears in iowa br br with a limited budget the interior view of meth use is portrayed quite vividly with quite scary hallucinations we certainly see them go crazy br br while the iowa locations are used very well including an amusing scene of a propane gas robbery the accents and church references are confusingly southern baptist guns seem to be used by law abiding and law breaking citizens here more than in any inner city drug dealing movie br br the songs of iowa's best known bard greg brown are used throughout but oddly are not listed in the credits i hope they were used with permission br br i caught this at its commercial run in nyc because i missed it at the tribeca film festival where it got considerable and inexplicable buzz
<START> there are no spoilers here because there is no plot to spoil madchen amick is living proof a face can make a living acting no talent required the only bright spot are a few really good one liners delivered very nicely by alice krige but then again she is alice krige her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be she is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot how they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery the screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script it has major continuity problems superficial stereotypical characters horror formula writing and simply falls short of making any sense what so ever the creatures while they have neat skills like going dim the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored br br don't waste any time on this one
<START> zero day has a purpose and this is not simply entertainment it delivers a message about its specialised subject school shootings charting the lives of two friends andre and cal leading up to an attack on their high school br br whilst the movie started in somewhat unassuming fashion an impromptu announcement of the coming attack in amateurish teenage style followed by some brief encounters with the boys families it is not long before we are down to business with the boys showing us their collection of guns their fetishistic love of them their sprawling sporadic narcissistic fantasies and even in a controversial scene how to build pipe bombs br br so what is the movie trying to say what is really motivating these soon to be killers it seems hard to really pinpoint they certainly do not come across as cold blooded psychopaths yet they are planning an act of sheer brutality this brings me to what i feel is the genius in part of zero day cal and andre talk constantly about how much they are on a different level how above the rest of us they are and how they will 'leave us all behind ' like the columbine killers they truly feel superior like nietzsche's res sentiment cal and andre's value system seems to have been born out of rejection from their society yet we are given only glimpses of this an expression of hatred for a popular athlete for example so where is the motivation what i feel is that coccio portrayed two individuals desperate to make a statement of superiority a gesture of their power yet who have no reasonable venue for it hence they turn to mass murder and the kind of which that will garner them more attention than they could ever realise this is why in part school shooters seem able to carry out atrocious acts despite coming from good stable loving homes the murder is part of a fantasy cal and andre are totally lost in their fantasy they almost fail to see the reality of their actions they turn fantasy into tragedy br br what is secondly most enthralling about this film is the character development and the unique dependence cal and andre have on each other andre is throughout the film overtly the leader of the two cal's embrace of his demeanour and attire seem somewhat forced andre is uptight andre is intense and serious he completely shuns others except for his family he is meticulous and precise about everything he does and for a while appears the prime mover in the plot to attack the school yet he is likable in his own way he does not embrace teenage nonsense and in part we feel compelled to agree with him yet these moments are shattered by andre's fleeting gestures of violence towards us the audience treating us as both confidante and potential victim cal on the other hand seems more relaxed than andre more accepting of reality yet he is in his own way dominant we have many personal moments of introspection with cal's video diary scenes when he is alone and apart from andre cal seems to be struggling with his own personal demons and using their plan to exorcise himself of them andre is jealous of cal going to the prom with an old friend he wants cal all to himself cal placates andre and encourages him for the first time in his life andre seems to have found someone who believes in him and who admires him he cannot lose it whilst cal has found someone offering him a way out br br the movie certainly picks up pace and improves as it nears its grim conclusion there is an excellent moment when cal attends the high school prom suddenly the star of the movie becomes shy and introverted not at all at ease with his peers yet we are inclined to feel more connection with cal than with the raucous bawdy crowd screaming juvenile obscenities whilst drinking heavily in their limo theirs is an episode all too common and recognisable we do not want to relate to them when it is over and cal is back with andre silently preparing one of their final videos we like the characters feel once again at ease safe in the fantasy world they created we feel like shunning the masses as they have br br the penultimate scene is superb the final video sees andre and cal arming themselves in their car just moments before attacking it is all too real and truly creates a sense of impending doom by know we know cal and andre and are realising they are about to actually do it with a kind of morbid fascination we are also relishing the films catharsis br br the massacre shot in cctv fashion is at times shocking and whilst it was certainly the perfect choice to depict the massacre if we were going to it is not void of flaws what is most significant is the sudden radical change of perception we have of cal and andre looking at them in the this person suddenly they are the callous killers we knew they would become yet refused to acknowledge that they would it is violent and real our heroes have become monsters and the reality of their fantasy is a terrible tragedy which costs them everything br br the final scene shows a group of teens filming themselves burning the crosses erected for andre and cal in disgust that they have been memorialised having known andre and cal we can only feel almost a sadness that they are actually gone forever and that they certainly did not win anything br br zero day is a must see for anyone interested in these violent acts sensationalised by the media it is a character study well worth experiencing
