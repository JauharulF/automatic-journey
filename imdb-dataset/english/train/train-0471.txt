<START> trying to compare or represent this swill as anything hitchcockian is an out n out attempt to mislead hitchcock fans to waste 7 on this movie weak acting weak story weak script br br no real suspense no thrills you wait all through the weakness of this movie for the big payoff or even any payoff you're left thinking what the heck was that all about br br and please enough with the movement to make alternative lifestyles hip and politically correct i can't recommend this to anyone did i mention how weak the acting is williams did a better job as peter pan and mork but those were much more innocent times
<START> now i get it the title refers to each audience member's immediate post reaction after 68 minutes of mental torture trying too hard to be terrifying lacking good dialogue even any fear for that matter really makes the screaming skull more like a snoring dull albeit the mansion and property set in black and white does set a dark tone for the movie but that's about it the only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money on this remember the coffin guarantee in the beginning that may be the funniest thing i have ever witnessed on screen sad thing is that viewers probably hoped director alex nichol was forcibly placed in a coffin nailed shut and buried alive for his lame effort jenny placed in this unfortunate horrific situation never really draws any sympathy you would feel for a woman whose anxiety is blamed on a haunted cranial receptacle also her husband john comes off as a condescending wannabe smooth talker but this doesn't work and he ends up proving how tough he is by slapping a helpless cripple around ah mickeyÂthe days before you could get a restraining order against estate caretakers like him this guy's approach is not very good or maybe too much airplane glue still despite his strange persona mickey probably is the only good thing going for this movie providing a slight sense of entertainment and i can't get enough of a guy saying it was mary and rummaging through pots in a greenhouse
<START> ok i don't really think that trailer park boys has bad story lines because they kick ass they just conflict with each other br br for example near the end of the movie it shows ricky and julian telling patrick lewis to put the dog down and walk away then at the end it shows ricky and julian saying that they've been in jail for 2 years in the tv series pilot the first clip they show is the same clip of ricky and julian yelling at patrick lewis but in the tv series they've supposedly only been in jail for 18 months br br also they give us the impression that the movie's story line and the tv series' story line are connected because of the yelling scene between the guys but some actors portray totally different characters of course patrick roach plays patrick lewis in the movie but in the series he plays randy sam tarasco plays one of the guys who pays ricky for an extermination and then he plays sam losco in the series br br also again i know i have a lot to say in the movie the guys snort coke instead of smoking hash the thing is they never actually confirm that the two story lines are connected in anyway other than the yelling scene br br sorry to keep on blabbing
<START> while being a great james arness western this film has gone down as the worst alamo film ever made the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it and just downright untruths to boot continuity was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes come on then there is brian keith's ridiculous hat costumer must of been away or something or just out of their mind
<START> albuquerque is a film that has all the elements of a class a western except one the story that really belongs to a class b or c that was acceptable at the time the film was made when people were so thrilled to see a western in color but nowadays it just looks very primitive nonetheless for people who enjoy old westerns it is entertaining the original color and sound are very well kept on the dvd that recently came out gabby hayes is a good sidekick lon chaney is mean as always and randolph scott a bit more cheerful than usual in a film named albuquerque you would expect to see something that would remind you of the city but the town that is shown here could be just anywhere
<START> except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads this movie is really really bad the cheap production values don't help of course you wouldn't really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn't keep trying to convince you they had a production values to begin with even for a b movie genre freak like myself this movie really sucks
<START> this sci fi adventure is not the best and by no means the worst i agree with the statement that bad sci fi is comical bizarre pink tinting and unusual special effects make this a favorite for the late late late show viewers space explorers on the planet mars fight off strange giant amoeba like monsters and other strange creatures pretty cool br br the cast includes les tremayne naura hayden gerald mohr and jack kruschen get comfy and enjoy don't feel bad if you nod off for a moment i agree with adding this to the list of cult classics to not miss
<START> overall this movie is dreadful and should have never been made one of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters for example if she is about to be attacked you want to feel oh my god no but you don't in this case you don't care because there is no link that has been made to know the character in the trailer it seemed as though the movie would be great yet there is no suspense what so ever really there could have been maybe some mystery but there is not all she has is a toolbox was said on the dvd's back you would think that it was carefully planned this movie and cleverly made but it is not the ending was just awful very straight forward and pointless too the acting is either average or below average maybe even lower in my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life the special effects and sets were average too nothing special what so ever there is not much gore or bloody violence not much blood is shown this movie was advertised to make it sound quite amazing yet really its not even worth looking for i do not recommend this to anyone unless they are easily satisfied by a few fights and a boring story
<START> this film has a clear storyline which is quite unusual to the musical genre cats phantom of the opera and other andrew lloyd webber's musicals can be considered metaphorical as they use literary works as their framework biarkan bintang menari bbm 's storyline touches the very core of human relationships especially that of indonesian people despite the fact the film was based on a supposedly fairytale it's actually a fantasy of the 'child' in indonesian adults the dance sequences are not perfect yet the songs represent how indonesians express themselves i reckon the choreographer should explore indonesian way of dancing by not dismaying the fact that indonesia's dance development tends to be more westernized the dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not synchronized with the songs and or music yet i still love this movie and regard it as a new wave of indonesian film genre which i hope to improve in the future
<START> this movie is perfect for all the romantics in the world john ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie sam hits close to home is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with ben gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with i'm sure i've met arthur in my travels somewhere all around an excellent choice to pick up any evening
<START> this movie resonated with me on two levels as a kid i was evacuated from london and planted on unwilling hosts in a country village while i escaped the bombing and had experiences which produced treasured memories for example hearing a nightingale sing one dark night for the very first time and enjoying a life i never could have had in london i missed my family and worried about them tom is an old man whose wife and child have both died and who lives alone in a small country village as an old man who is now without a wife whose kids have gotten married and live far away in another province i am again sometime lonely the boy's mother is a religious fanatic with very odd ideas of raising a child since a deep affection has grown between old tom oakley and this young lad tom goes in search of him and finally rescues him from very odd and dangerous circumstances at the end of the story there is great tension since due to some bureaucratic ruling it seems that the child is going to lose someone who has developed a loving relationship with him
<START> cornel wilde and three dumbbells search for sunken treasure in the south atlantic br br the treasure hunters led by wilde fight a group of territorial sharks with cute little sneers on their hungry faces wilde and his merry men must find a way to take themselves off the menu so they can begin excavating an old spanish galleon filled with gold bullion br br after the crew engages in a small eternity of pushing shoving arguing and listening to wilde's annoying health tips 5 crazy convicts board the boat and complicate things now it is a battle of wits as to who gets the treasure and who gets to see what the inside of a shark's stomach looks like br br at least wilde is in shape wearing exactly the same thing he wore in 'the naked prey' 10 years earlier and he has remained in excellent condition br br made on a budget of 75 cents
<START> i really loved it although while reading the reviews it was quite disturbing to me but as an anime art fan i can totally understand this perfect art work even though some of it was against my cultures and believes but hey it's the world of art the beginning of the film is very strong strange and confusing it's hard to understand the contents which make me respect the one who made it only someone who is extremely opened can do such daring film it's absolutely not for kids even though the characters are cute and adorable but they go through some disturbing adventures that cannot be erased sorry if the spelling is wrong from ones memory
<START> it's hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn't enough words to give this magnificent stylish and unique film the veneration it unquestionably deserves they should make this the official and only true real hamlet movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by kenneth branagh's hamlet br br it's a perfect complete version of the play potent massive earthshaking first class masterpiece shakespeare would have been proud of they've packed over a dozen of world famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction br br the cameras embrace gracefully the enchanting coulisses branagh is phenomenal in the leading role his sharp irresistible performance is the only one of it's kind and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end branagh's version of hamlet is among the ten best motion pictures ever
<START> my family and i have viewed this movie often over the years it is clean wholesome heartbreaking and heartwarming showing us the compassion between two families of two countries thousands of miles apart and by the most uncanny of coincidences it's almost as if the hand of god had to be intervening br br 5 yo jodelle micah ferland who plays desi the heart stricken little girl does a magnificent job of acting her part and for me she was the priam choice for the lead role br br all in all a 10 out of 10 there are no downsides to this sweet human story children of all ages will tearfully then joyfully watch this and it will bring the viewing family together with smiles and good feelings
<START> when this film was released in 1997 the 'special effects' such as they are were poor they would have been dated even for the 1980s and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s have had the same or better sfx work certainly no one involved in the production of this film was looking for an oscar it's a wild departure from director fred olen ray's usual stuff most of which has the word bikini in the title bikini pirates bikini chain gang bikini girls from the lost planet etc and are little more than t a flicks but here we are with a film rated u and aimed squarely at the kiddies you've got to give him credit for diversifying this was a minor direct to video cult hit which later resulted in a couple of sequels invisible mom 2 and invisible dad dee wallace stone whose career went downhill fast after 1982s e t plays the 'invisible mom' of the films title and would return for the sequel russ tamblyn whose career had been in free fall even longer since 1961s west side story plays the villainous dr woorter it's probably fair to say that most of the cast were at the point in their careers where they would be prepared to work on almost anything just to pay the bills that month except maybe young trenton knight as josh it's rather telling though that although he worked prior to this movie this child actor didn't work again after the sequel invisible mom 2 maybe the film was cursed after all he wasn't that bad in this film for a child actor he's pretty good no better or worse than any of his more experienced co stars br br as mentioned above the invisibility effects are naff to say the least the direction is poor the writing obvious and the acting nothing to write home about there are plenty of worse films out there though and for anyone under the age of about ten this film will no doubt be quite watchable most adults will probably want to do a disappearing act of their own while it is on though and i wouldn't blame them one bit
<START> i couldn't watch more than 14 minutes of it it's a great combination of really bad acting and really bad directing the shots used are disgusting they broke the 180 degrees angle all the time my head hurts try to watch that load of you know what dirt on the mystery machine window make you see light from the lighting on the windows annoying what else it's so badly framed all the time it's just make you want to scream at that lady directing there i only directed short films but i'm pretty sure i'd be way better than that directing a feature film the story is unbelievable just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it's gonna be pretty awful so pretty much try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost it'll save you the 5 bucks or so for the rental and that 1h30 hour of your life you'll never get back
<START> as the first of the tv specials offered on the elaborate box set barbra streisand the television specials released last november this disc is being released separately for those who do not want to fork over the dollars for all five specials as an investment this is indeed the best of the bunch if only for the fact that this is streisand at her purest and most eager to impress that she succeeds so brilliantly is a key component of her legend signed to a long term contract with cbs to produce hour long variety shows an almost extinct format nowadays streisand was all of 22 in this cbs special first broadcast in april 1965 at that point of her career her notoriety was limited to a handful of best selling albums a few dazzling tv appearances on variety and talk shows and her successful broadway run in funny girl br br filmed in crisp black and white the program is divided into three distinct parts with the creative transitional use of i'm late from disney's alice in wonderland the first segment cleverly shows her growing up from childhood through numbers as diverse as make believe and i'm five opening with a comic monologue about pearl from istanbul the second part moves on location to manhattan's chic bergdorf goodman's where she is elegantly costumed in a series of glamorous outfits while singing depression era songs like i've got plenty of nuthin' and the best things in life are free with comic irony back to basics the third segment is a straight ahead concert which opens with a torchy version of when the sun comes out includes a funny girl medley and ends with her classic melancholic take on happy days are here again over the ending credits also included is the brief introduction she taped in 1986 when the special was first released on vhs for those who know streisand only for her pricey concert tickets and political fundraising this is a genuine eye opener into why she is so revered now
<START> once upon a time some evil people made a movie about a guy that got shot into space supposedly to go to saturn but really only to some stock footage of solar flares and then he gets a nose bleed and before you know it he's laying in a hospital bandaged head to foot and then an overweight nurse with an ill fitting uniform comes in and gets eaten by the guy whose supposed to be melting all over the place but never seems to lose any mass and then nasa or at least one guy at nasa gets upset about it and calls one other guy in to hunt him down but the guy they sent to hunt the melting guy has to go home and have soup first and his oddly shaped wife forgot the crackers so he can't have crackers and then he has to go out and look for the melting guy with a geiger counter and that doesn't really work so he really only follows the trail of half eaten corpses and then there's something about a sheriff and two ugly old people in a lemon grove and a women with a meat cleaver and some kind of industrial plant with trigger happy security guards and since i can't tell you how the movies ends all i can say is jonathan demme is in it somewhere with some guy with the stupid name of burr debenning and if there's any justice in the world everyone connected with this movie died a hideous violent death and was unable to make more movies and the world lived happily ever after the end
<START> way way back in the 1980s long before nafta was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities the united states and japan were at each other's throat in the world manufacturing race remember sayings like 'union yes ' 'the japanese are taking this country over ' and 'americans are lazy ' br br as the reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace director ron howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash 'gung ho ' which drew over 36 million in u s box office receipts while in many ways dated howard's tongue in cheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life today br br 'gung ho' focuses on hunt stevenson michael keaton the automakers union rep from hadleyville a small depressed town in the foothills of pennsylvania stevenson has been asked to visit the assan motor company in tokyo similar to real life toyota which is considering a u s operation at the town's empty plant with hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse assan decides to move in and stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly line br br the 112 minutes of 'gung ho' is a humorous look at these two sides with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered on one hand an american workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism on the other hand japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self worth in stevenson we find an american working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings with the survival of his workers' jobs and most of hadleyville on the line stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance although his cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble besides answering to the heads of assan we witness a delicate balancing act between stevenson and his fellow union members many of whom he grew up with this includes buster george wendt willie john turturro and paul clint howard ron's brother br br the japanese cast is headed by gedde watanabe also known for 'sixteen candles' and 'volunteers ' watanabe plays kazihiro the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for american life he is constantly shadowed by saito sab shimono the nephew of assan's ceo who is desperate to take his spot in the pecking order while given a light touch these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the japanese working culture br br with hunt stevenson dominating the script michael keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work 'gung ho' is indeed a slam dunk success for keaton who also teamed with ron howard in 1994's 'the paper ' he made this film during a string of lighter roles that included 'mr mom ' 'beetle juice ' and 'the dream team' before venturing into 'batman ' 'one good cop ' and 'my life ' it's also hard not to like gedde watanabe's performance as the odd man out who first wears japanese ribbons of shame before teaming up with stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unit br br the supporting cast is top notch including wendt turturro shimono and soh yamamura as assan ceo sakamoto mimi rogers supplies a romantic interest as audrey hunt's girlfriend edwin blum lowell ganz and babaloo mandel teamed up for gung ho's solid writing the incidental music which received a bmi film music award was composed by thomas newman gung ho's soundtrack songs are wall to wall 80s including 'don't get me wrong ' 'tuff enuff ' and 'working class man ' br br the success of 'gung ho' actually led to a short lived tv series on abc while more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago ron howard's film still has its comic value it is available on dvd as part of the paramount widescreen collection and is a tad short changed audio options are provided in english 5 1 surround english dolby surround and french 'dubbing ' but subtitles are in english only there are no extras not even the theatrical trailer on the plus side paramount's digital transfer is quite good with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound while a few extras would have been helpful especially that 'gung ho' was a box office success there's little to complain about the film presentation itself br br out of 4
