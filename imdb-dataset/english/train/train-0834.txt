<START> highly regarded at release but since rather neglected immense importance in the history of performing arts a classic use of embedded plots one of my favourite films why hasn't the soundtrack been re released
<START> this is a film of immense appeal to a relatively well defined group of which i am not a part i went to a preview of this movie not knowing what to expect i ultimately found it disappointing the history of a dreadfully dysfunctional oftentimes downright twisted hungarian jewish family is not my cup of tea an epic saga like this should really provide its viewers with something more in the end ultimately pictures such as this are about the human condition this picture cast almost no new light on any of its more meaningful facets
<START> clint eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this but this one does not embarrass him dirty harry catches everyone's attention and unless one wants to watch romance there is no reason why you won't like him he is cool because he is dirty is great because he kills without much thinking is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesn't care br br from what i have seen in movies in which eastwood acts the character of the lead role always captivates the audience in white hunter black heart he is the crazy director in in the line of fire he is the old 'un while here is the almost jobless with his job that is to say he makes work for himself doesn't care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacation br br based on a rape victim this movie is promising for all the no non sense movie watchers the movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot however what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not as it is far too obvious from the beginning it is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving also there are too many people far dirtier than dirty harry
<START> i admit i have a weakness for alternate history stories from its a wonderful life to groundhog day to 12 01 among those greats is this little gem it's pretty difficult to get through mr destiny without giving a nod of appreciation to each and every cast member from the goodhearted james belushi to the murderous courtney cox this movie lacks the gravitas and scale to make it a great film but it's a fine cheer up on a rainy afternoon it's also a great rental for an inexpensive date
<START> i rented this movie from blockbuster on a whim i like alan arkin and the cover was catching i read the back and knew right away it was going to either be the best or the worst movie i have ever seen i guess i got lucky i laughed from beginning to end alan arkin brings a great character to this movie i have since bought a used rental copy for my own collection and watch it all the time i have recommeded this movie to loads of people and they all enjoyed it as much as i did i see complaints about the menus and dvd functions but it doesn't take away from the movie the disk was authored for blockbuster exculsivley which is why they didn't allow you to skip past the previews aside from that you shouldn't let the functions of the dvd to deterr you from watching the excellent film
<START> another turgid action adventure flick from the quinn martin productions factory roy thinnes plays undercover agent diamond head mr head to you working for his g man handler aunt mary looking for tree who's on a mission to well just watch the movie br br this one deserved and got the full mst3k sendup as the boys and various reviewers have pointed out the movie fargo had more hawaiian locations than this film apparently shot on a puny budget this movie highlights hawaii's broken down dive shops gas stations and cheapo hotels zulu later to star as kono in hawaii five o appears as thinnes' lumpy inept sidekick while france nguyen models the jenny craig diet gone horribly wrong others sharing the flickering screen include a drunken richard harris knockoff a george takai imitator a not so smart hit man with sprayed on sansabelt slacks and the villain tree sporting a veddy british accent you can pretty much figure out the plot halfway through the opening credits but relax just enjoy the giddy mediocrity of this 70's movie of the week br br whenever i think of this movie and i think of this movie often i catch myself humming the theme written for flute and tuba no one knows why br br trivia note diamond head was directed by jeannot szwarc one of three contract directors at universal who would go on to make much bigger films in his case jaws 2 the others were john badham war games and a young fellow named steven spielberg
<START> sammo hung's 1989 film pedicab driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece i have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any hong kong film ever has it is a combination of pretty good and well written drama interesting and sympathetic and also non sympathetic characters some genuinely funny humor and truly over the top hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with hong kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry br br sammo and max mok siu chung play two pedicab drivers who live in hong kong in the middle part of the last century i think they drive their cabs and are also desperate for love sammo is interested in local baker girl ping nina li chi while max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful fennie yuen kit ying he falls madly in love with many other characters get introduced too and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so i cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in hong kong soon we get to know for instance that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists too and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created as well as some nice drama br br the film has a great cast the leads are all very good and restrained not as painfully awful over acting and humor as in sammo's otherwise great eastern condors 1987 for example and they are also thanks to the carefully written screenplay pretty likable and easy to identify with the cast includes many familiar hk cinema faces and directors in small roles like corey yuen kwai the legendary action director and director of films like saviour of the soul 1 and 2 ninja in the dragon's den and fong sai yuk 1 and 2 the masterful composer lowell lo koon ting john woo's the killer and ringo lam's school on fire and prison on fire among many others pedicab driver included the shaw veteran liu chia liang whom with sammo has a furious fight with sticks alfred cheung kin ting the director of dark hk noir classic on the run from 1988 the late great lam ching ying best known for his friendly face in various hk vampire horror kung fu comedies to name just a few in fact the cast in pedicab driver is one of the most interesting i've seen in any other hk production br br the film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between max mok and fennie yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to lowell lo's character they really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love no matter what's your past or what you've done for living get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship and of course love still i think what fennie says to max about the future bad cooking is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively unfortunately br br but then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in which is the action the outrageous and over the top action the fight scenes include traditional kung fu some sticks meat cleavers and the like and they're used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene i've seen in any film ever jackie chan's drunken master ii 1994 they really are that great there are wires and they're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or punched simply amazing and again something only hong kong cinema can deliver also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold his her breath as the film has one fast car vs pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination still the film makers seem not to accept the violence of the film as sammo is like the late bruce lee willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa and i think this kind of morale no matter how obvious or shallow it may be is a good thing even in a harmless film like this as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment br br the film has also some very witty bits of humor that i'm not sure everyone in hollywood or america for example would understand or like at all the hilarious star wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when i realized what i was seeing also some funny scenes are created out of sammo's passion for ping still the greatest amazement filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction of course br br pedicab driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among sammo's greatest achievements if the few minor flaws were not there this could rate even brighter and higher 8 10
<START> marvelous film again dealing with the trials and tribulations of world war 11 england what makes this film so good is the touching of the human element this film is definitely in the tradition of such british line classics such as mrs miniver and hope and glory as is the case with this film we see the desperation of people in the time of war br br the performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered john thaw who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the london bombing br br we soon see why this child wets his bed he comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly br br the old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life when the child is returned to his mother the old man goes to london and seeks him out only to find tragedy he literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boy's home br br the picture is so good because it deals and builds on endearing relationships
<START> this was quite possibly the worst film i've ever seen the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense and the acting was awful i'm a big fan of amber benson i think she's usually a wonderful actress i can't imagine why she decided to do this film her character piper is drunk for almost the whole film with the exception of the opening scene on the plus side there was several points in the film where the acting was so bad i actually laughed out loud but despite that i would not recommend this film to anyone it's only 80 minutes long but that's 80 minutes of your life that you will have completely wasted
<START> today i wrote this review in anger at uwe boll and hollywood br br hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation 911 changed everything it changed our perception of security it changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity most importantly and devastatingly it changed our world br br however i can't not stress how utterly repulsed disillusioned and angry i am at the careless blatant ignorance of hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction this film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word of mouth among moviegoers and critics alike most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press hollywood has sunk to a new low even lower than the low down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty behind it all is uwe boll i am very angry at this movie how dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost how dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy how dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post 911 world how dare they br br to those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty i say this with a heavy heart with all my strength remember think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person think back to that day ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks br br ask yourself if you have a soul br br think remember respect the memories of the lives lost on 911 by not seeing this film at all
<START> after reading the original play i thought it would have been much more difficult to adapt to screen than it turned out to be donal mccann puts in a once off great performance as public gar the repressed antagonist who is manifested openly on screen by his extroverted but unseen to others alterego private gar eamonn kelly also plays an excellent screwballs whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched only by gar br br definitely worth renting out if you can find it probably unavailable outside ireland uk
<START> this film is not morbid nor is it depressing it is sad because aids in the early '90s was sad but its real message is one of love and perseverance br br mark and tom were in a long term loving relationship their devotion to each other is evident right away and as the ravages of aids escalate and become the focal point of their lives you see strength and commitment that are truly heartwarming br br when silverlake life was originally released i was deeply involved in hiv aids education and health care volunteering as a counselor at an hiv aids clinic the film spoke to me like no other aids film of its day could because mark and tom were real people living the very experiences that i saw on a daily basis in real life i knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch aids eat away at formerly vibrant young healthy people seeing it happen to mark and tom in the film was very much like watching my real life friends deteriorate it touched me in a way that even all these years later still affects me
<START> deathtrap runs like a play within a movie about who did what to whom as it primarily takes place on one set the premise is that an accomplished playwright whose star is falling receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and so he plans to off his protege and appropriate his play to the loud protests of his wife or so you think for the first half of the movie past the halfway mark deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn its premise on its head then right around and then in a mad spin all the time keeping its title appropriate it's an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit br br michael caine as the senior playwright plays himself in this movie a slightly loony and very dramatic brit no surprises here he does his usual good work he gets the best line of deathtrap which he executes perfectly what is your definition of success being gang banged in a state penitentiary br br christopher reeve on the other hand juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious and psychopathic young playwright he also gets to show off his very toned body which he must've retained coming off the superman movies br br caine and reeve have collaborated in another movie that's one of my favorite comedies noises off it similarly revolves around a play as well although this time caine is the director and reeve is an actor they are joined by comic veterans carol burnett john ritter marilu henner taxi and mark linn baker perfect strangers together they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bed hopping cast and crew of a play on the surface the movie looks to be mostly slapstick but upon watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch wish this underrated movie was available on dvd
<START> a number of richard attenborough's films as director have been biographies of major historical figures young winston gandhi chaplin grey owl is also a filmed biography of a historical individual but in this case attenborough's subject is a much more obscure character br br grey owl was a canadian writer of the 1920s and 1930s who promoted the ideas of environmentalism and nature conservation at a time when these causes were less fashionable than they are today he was widely believed to be an american indian the story he told about himself was that he had been born in mexico to a scottish father and apache mother and had emigrated to canada where he had been adopted as a member of the ojibway tribe he lived in a cabin by a lake in a remote part of the canadian wilderness where he earned a living as a trapper he toured britain twice in 1935 and 1937 to promote his books and to give lectures on conservationism and achieved great success even being introduced to the royal family during one of these tours attenborough then a teenager saw grey owl at the london palladium theatre after his death in 1938 however it was revealed that he had not been who he claimed to be his real name was archibald belaney and he had been born in the english seaside town of hastings br br the film departs somewhat from the facts of grey owl's life in a scene set in 1934 he states that he is 41 years old in reality he was born in 1888 so would have been 46 in that year 46 would have been pierce brosnan's age when the film was made so i am not sure why this change was made numerous events are compressed into the last four years of grey owl's life 1934 1938 in the film it is during this period that he meets and marries gertrude bernard whom he called anahareo in reality he met and married gertrude as early as 1925 the film also omits the fact that they were divorced in 1936 and that grey owl remarried shortly before his death br br the revelation of grey owl's true identity adversely affected his posthumous reputation and he was dismissed as a fraud his supposed deceit was even used to discredit the causes which he had championed richard attenborough however takes a more sympathetic view of his achievements one of the themes explored by the film is the question of ethnic identity although the erstwhile archibald belaney was not a canadian indian by birth there is no doubt that he had a deep knowledge of ojibway culture and lore and that he spoke their language fluently he was accepted by the ojibway as a member of their tribe it therefore seems unfair to describe his claim to a native north american identity as being a fraudulent one merely because it was an identity he had chosen rather than one he had been born into br br according to the film grey owl's wife gertrude was herself of indian descent but came from a family which had been assimilated into white canadian culture her marriage can therefore be seen as her reclamation of her family's original cultural heritage she was clearly influenced by her husband but she also had an influence on him persuading him to give up his work as a fur trapper as she had moral objections to killing animals for their fur br br one criticism made of the film is that pierce brosnan is miscast as the hero a criticism which seems to be rooted in the preconception that brosnan can only play action heroes in the james bond mould it seems to me however that brosnan may deliberately have taken this role in order to avoid being typecast the taciturn backwoodsman grey owl being about as far from the suave sophisticated agent bond as one can get the original bond sean connery also seems to have deliberately opted for contrasting roles when he appeared in films like the hill or the molly maguires brosnan is in fact very good in this role although i would agree with those who found annie galipeau weak as gertrude br br another frequently voiced criticism with which i would not agree is that the film is boring certainly it is not an action film like the bonds nor is it a great epic biopic like gandhi and it may indeed seem boring to those who were expecting it to be either the one or the other it is however likely to please anyone with an interest in the early days of the conservationist movement or the philosophical implications of national and ethnic identity the scenes of the canadian forests are also beautifully photographed richard attenborough has done us a service by helping to revive interest in this half forgotten but fascinating figure 7 10
<START> this review may contain some spoilers br br just when you thought they didn't make them so extremely bad anymore along comes rae dawn chong as a space vixen and willie nelson as a native american witchdoctor it's even worse when you factor in that these two are the better aspects of starlight ' a film that should only be viewed for laughs br br chong is an alien sent to earth to seek out the only remaining half breed part man and part alien apparently the earth is in dire straits something is wrong with the genetics of mankind and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland only by duplicating the dna of the half breed can the kindly alien race save the planet don't ask me how that is since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution which is caused by humans you would think earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures not saving them anyway the half breed turns out to be billy wirth a man living in a small southwestern town and is part native american from his mother's line despite the fact that his mother is a red headed caucasian and his grandfather is willie nelson wasn't this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic carmen electra bomb the chosen one' such a howler chong arrives in her ship just as wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend before you can say utter the word hogwash ' chong is revealing her secret to wirth who isn't surprised for a moment and spreading the word to wirth's family chong also makes pals with wirth's mother who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years well this is because wirth's father was an alien that abandoned her of course he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to earth for wirth so he can use wirth's dna to make the people of earth his slaves huh his laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie not only are they boring but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most br br the ideas might be nice on paper but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien but the effects are the bane of the movie the opening scene involves chong on her spaceship communicating with her superior someone who we do not see but that chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light they use no spoken words but telepathy so we are treated to subtitles trouble is both chong and her superior's subtitles both look alike and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually speaking' at any given moment which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish the spaceship is the worst effect to come out of hollywood this side of an ed wood film now i am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this but these effects really got to me the most offensive was the most simple one a fake night sky the stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone most notably are the moments where chong tells someone she comes from pleiades and we get a shot of the seven stars thing is the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie but any stargazer knows that pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations perseus and taurus and the cluster doesn't take up much room in the sky at all these effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment be careful for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have willie nelson turn into a human spotlight and oh it has to be seen to be believed br br starlight star bright last star i see tonight i wish i might i wish i may not have to watch any more of this trash today br br zantara's score 1 out of 10
<START> this is a very good made for tv film it depicts trouble in suburbia circa 1970's and the sort of neighbors one certainly does not want to have around the worst most upsetting part of the film was when the punk teenagers killed the family dog the teens do everything to annoy and harass this poor family but boy does the lead character take vengeance on those punk teenagers in the end the father homeowner surely does not take all of the aggravation from the punk teens lightly and is quick to retaliate after lack of help from the police that is he stands up to them and protects his home and his family a very good actor i might add br br i watched this on tv when i was like 8 or 9 i have never seen it again on tv and would like to definitely a good one it's the sort of movie one may catch on a weekday night very late at night and can't stop watching or an afternoon film on a weekend it's the kind they just don't show anymore br br it is definitely worth seeing
<START> this is a great movie most of us have seen jurassic park where the chaos theory is summarized by telling about a butterfly's wings causing a tornado on the other side of the planet well bug is all about that or at least something don't worry this is no spoiler i'm definitely not a religious type and don't believe in pre destined stuff fate etc but this movie surely makes you wonder if coincidence really exists br br further more the acting and camera are excellent too another prove that it's still possible to make a good movie without a zillion bucks
<START> the movie is just as fun as staring at the sun sheriff pataki is a total retard that loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear making a smoke ring from his puffy cigars and drinking booze while the doctor acts like a zombie version of nicholas cage sucking up all that so called blood which in reality seemed like fruit punch br br most of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a movie the rest of the characters in this movie are total wastes of time the ending was awful the outlines were cheesy and the scenes were terrible what else more should i say to you viewers out there my advice would be to get your rabies shot if you've already watched the movie this movie may give you the foam in the mouth if you didn't get your up to date shots
<START> my friends and i were just discussing how frustrated we are with the way movies and especially romantic comedy's are being made we feel offended by the schlock that hollywood is serving up these days as they act like all is well br br well all is not well with the exception of a few bright spots like this movie it doesn't have the big name actors the big budget i don't think it had a big release i rented from hollywood video it didn't really have anything that most big budget romantic comedy's have br br but it did have what most of those lack it had great chemistry between the love interests parker jonathan schaech and sam alison eastwood their love story wasn't forced on us like so many the director took his time to allow these characters to truly get to know each other their story reminded me of one of my favorites tootsie br br the supporting cast added not only really funny comic moments but depth to the story as well james legros' character was absolutely priceless sam's gay friend was hysterical parker's interaction with his fellow employees in a psychic hotline was a lot of fun br br i laughed i cried i remembered how great it feels to fall in love
<START> true the idea for this tv series may have sprung from the immense success which ally mcbeal is enjoying worldwide even here in germany however this said edel starck is very different from ally mcbeal in many ways br br the two main characters work beautifully together felix edel felix noble played by well known german actor christoph m ohrt and sandra starck sandra strong noble strong get it played by charming rebecca immanuel exchange quick romantic repartees and continually spy on each other while engaging in sitcom like criminal cases in berlin and surroundings further they are aided by a magnificent cast of co stars most notably their secretary played by isabel tuengerthal who is a rare gem with great comic potential also the shady wheeler dealer otto and the noble childhood pal of felix frank work very well not to forget sandra's best friend and room mate patricia played by the beautiful barbara demmer br br all in all a joy to watch on monday nites no wonder that the series and its stars have received several prizes will felix get sandra br br i hope that we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out
