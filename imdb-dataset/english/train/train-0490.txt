<START> i tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission and let me tell you you'll watch anything under those circumstances not this piece of sh t though br br the first five minutes set the tone by weak porn movie quality acting weird out of the blue plot twists and unbelievable situations and behavior it gets worse after that this movie does not have one single saving grace and yet it is not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch it's just horrible i've seen quite many movies in my life and i'm not one of those snobby know all critics i mean i'll enjoy most movies to some extent even if they're bad this one man br br steer well clear of this one my friend
<START> somewhere on this site someone wrote that to get the best version of the works of jane austen one should simply read them i agree with that however we love adaptations of great literature and the current writers' strike brings to mind that without good writers it's hard for actors to bring their roles to life the current version of jane austen's persuasion shows us what happens when you don't have a good foundation in a well written adaptation this version does not compare to the 1995 version with amanda root and ciaran hinds which was well acted and kept the essence of the era and the constraints on the characters with the exception of the bizarre parade kissing in the street scene in bath the 2007 version shows a twitty anne who seems angst ridden the other characters were not very developed which is a crime considering how austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen understatements the sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely tossed about and mrs smith anne's bedridden and impoverished schoolmate is walking around in bath twittering away as many of the characters seemed to do the strength of character and the intelligence of captain wentworth which caused anne to love him in the first place didn't seem to be written into the rupert penry jones' wentworth ciaran hinds had more substance and was able to convey so much more with a look than p j was able to do with his poses all in all the 2007 version was a disappointment it seemed to reduce the novel into a hand wringing costumed melodrama of debatable worth if they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into austen's work they should have done what they do with adaptations of shakespeare adapt it to the present at least bride prejudice was taken out of the historical locational settings and was fun to watch as was clueless this wasn't persuasion but they didn't know what else to call it
<START> this is a strange cerebral surreal esoteric film if there is such a thing as intellectual horror cinema this film is it i started to get scared and wish there was someone else watching it with me and it barely has a plot i'm going to have to see this film again multiple times before i feel i really understand it if you're the kind of person who likes my dinner with andre and films by godard or if you do a lot of mind altering drugs you will probably enjoy this film wow
<START> inspector gadget 1999 br br starring matthew broderick rupert everett joely fisher andy dick dabney coleman director david kellogg 80 minutes rated pg br br by blake french br br disney's new film inspector gadget is about a cop named john who survives a major accident and is saved by a state of the art experimental operation that turns him into a robotic machine like agent who has tools and contraptions of all sorts built into his body at his use when he says go go only to be called inspector gadget br br the actual movie's structure is much like the body formation of inspector gadget himself it is noisy fragmented energetic and consist of a bunch of half hearted contraptions thrown together to make something that doesn't have much in common with anything else present the film is basically a series of zany action sequences that are kind of pasted together with characters and an uneven story that only kids between the ages of 6 9 would enjoy br br the cop who is dramatically reinvented is played by matthew broderick who until inspector gadget was on a success spree with movies like election his character becomes inspector gadget after an encounter with the film's heavy handed villain named claw he is played by rupert everett who has already experienced catastrophe this year with the dreadful william shakespeare's a midsummer nights dream br br there is a romantic subplot in this movie as well as ample amounts of scenes involving inspector gadget's wacky body parts and mechanism elements it has gadget and claw drooling over the attractive character brenda played by joely fisher for both her looks and her knowledge of a specific invention made by her late father who was earlier killed by claw competition evolves into fight scenes and a reason for many happenings in the film also a major character is the gadget mobil a life like automobile that is devised for inspector gadget himself it is voiced by d l hughly from the sitcom comedy the hughly's br br inspector gadget is a movie that i found quite bad i know i am not exactly a target audience of the filmmakers but even my ten year old relative found the film to his disliking the movie is full of distinct flaws and obvious problems i never found myself caring about the characters there is no mood development beyond some neat opening credits unlike the much worse 1997 film mr magoo which opened using clips of the original cartoon is it too much to ask for that same type of thing in this comedy which is seldom funny and hardly ever convincing the overall production design is nothing but a mess of incomplete sight gags and consists of one joke inspector gadget's bumbling goofiness br br in movies like this the audience lusts for boundaries something to help make out what can happen and what can not in inspector gadget there are no such boundaries this is truthfully nothing more than a party time for the actors who surly had lots of fun i am reminded of another lacking comedy released a few years ago called blankman which again contained lots of props and energy and the actors certainly had fun time with all the gizmos and props but it too lacked something needed for every movie audience participation br br a character that i found being left out a lot is gadgets daughter who by the end of the movie i still has not clue of what her name was she is used only as a plot device and i question how she was used to further the plot as well for her presence brings nothing relevant or productive to the film we never know her reactions to her father's operation or accidents thus this is someone who could have been completely left out and would have not affected the movie a bit br br in closing i'd like to state that inspector gadget is an awful insufficient excuse for a children's comedy and believe it or not i find myself comparing this film to last years violent and very anti young audience action picture blade i am stating once again that i had much rather have a movie where nothing happens than one in which everything happens inspector gadget had so much going for it at the same time it made literally made me dizzy br br
<START> amazing movie that in theory should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that i have long despaired of ever finding instead of relying on clichÃ©s and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments the lead characters are not perfect and so relating to them as people you could know is easy the movie is not trying to pull laughs or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance br br i am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel a moving thought provoking funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at tiffany's will soften even the hardiest heart
<START> first of all let me say that this is not the movie for people looking to watch something spirited and joyous for the holidays this movie is cold brutal and just downright depressing mary steenburgen plays a grinchy mom who is down on christmas because her husband has lost his job they are losing their house can't buy christmas presents for the kids etc you get the idea happy stuff for the holidays so along comes harry dean stanton as gideon the christmas angel who in his dark hat and long overcoat comes off more like a pedophile who hangs around children all day observing them what better way to instill the spirit of christmas in mary steenburgen than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in christmas again santa claus is a blackmailer and his christmas workshop looks more like a haven for refugee nazis on the lam the movie lays everything on so thick that you don't care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable i'm sure this film wanted to be something capra like but it left out the joy and sentiment on what a holiday film should be
<START> i can only assume that the other reviewers of this film are stockholders in the production company as this was quite possibly the worst movie i've seen in the last five years from the opening shot of a rabbi laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason it was clear that the actors in this film would kill to be considered b level both my wife and i were in a great mood before starting this film and we were genuinely looking forward to a funny popcorn movie we knew we hadn't rented citizen kane and we weren't expecting to see the most amazing movie ever however after 40 minutes of enduring the most painfully unfunny bit of garbage i've ever seen we shut it off instead of wasting another minutes of our lives br br if a comedy with no laughs terrible acting thin plot and annoying characters are your thing then this film is for you honestly troll 2 is better at least i laughed at the popcorn sex scene br br i cannot justify writing a longer review of this picture because i've already wasted almost an hour trying to find one joke
<START> horror spoofs are not just a thing of the 21st century way before the 'scary movie' series there were a few examples of this genre mostly in the 80s but like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss some like 'elvira mistress of the dark' mostly rise above that but other like 'saturday the 14th' and it's sequel fail to deliver the laughs but out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and that's 'transylvania 6 5000 ' a major waste of time for many reasons br br pros a great cast that does it's best some of the dopey humor is amusing a corny but catch theme song some good transylvanian locations br br cons threadbare plot mostly tedious pacing most of the humor just doesn't cut it the monsters are given little to do and little screen time i thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies lame ending that will likely make viewers angry br br final thoughts this is a comedy if it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor not roll our eyes and yawn aching for it to be over i can't believe anchor bay released this tired junk i'll admit it's not one of the worst films ever made but it's not worth anyone's time or money even if you're a fan of any of the actors see 'transylvania twist' instead br br my rating 2 5
<START> one of the best if not the best rock'n'roll movies ever and it's not just mindless fun there really were a lot of clever jokes in it of course i love the ramones but with all the anarchy and the i hate high school themes the film doesn't at all take itself too seriously which is what's great about it br br i first saw the movie in the spring of 1980 and i saw it again recently since i went to high school in the late 1970's it made me kind of nostalgic br br like i said this film doesn't take itself that seriously and isn't pretentious like so much other teen fare of the seventies eighties and nineties and to speak of it's not really dirty or disgusting either only pg rated that's rare for a movie in this category a great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule
<START> this is an incomprehensible horribly low budget piece of awfulness br br i don't even have the vocabulary to say how dire turgid boring confusing and just plain strange this effort is hey what d'ya know i do set in a post apocalyptic america some guys meet on a beach and slaughter and chaos ensue it was all so incomprehensible i couldn't make head or tail of any of it br br seriously how this got picked up by national lampoon totally defeats me it really is awful br br and not in a its so bad it's good cult way br br it is just awful awful awful awful br br honestly if you still don't believe me then watch it with every intention of loving it then come back here and tell me what you think even gerbils on acid couldn't hope to understand this br br avoid or even better destroy
<START> recap zandalee is a young woman that feels more and more trapped in her marriage with thierry thierry himself is struggling with the death of his father the previous year and has lost his way he has submerged himself in work laid of his writing and zandalee desperately misses the attraction between them into this enters johnny and old friend of thierry's who once were artists in exile together but johnny has kept on painting and just have a day job for the rent he takes the day as it comes and leaves tomorrow to its destiny there is an instant raw attraction between zandalee and johnny and they enter into an affair but zandalee struggles with her lust to be desired and her conscience and love for her husband but none of them not zandalee not johnny and not thierry can stop the relationships between them to spin totally out of control br br comments it is set as a thriller but maybe more a thriller of heart than a normal thriller where it's about life and death and threat of violence not that a thriller of heart can't take on fatal proportions but the threat comes from a different angle and it is not really until the second half in zandalee until the thriller emerges and even though the foundation for it is laid in the first half i can't really describe the genre as a thriller then much more of a romantic drama than anything else but with the underlying currents of other genres the developing thriller is there but it also has more than a little tint of a sensual erotic kind because that is what it is all about what drives the characters and therefore the entire story desire the need to have and the need to be br br in my opinion it is quite good definitely a lot better than its current 4 1 rating anyway it takes its time but it grows a good feeling of suspense and it handles the erotic part very well with taste it is always an integral part of the story needed to be there to give the story it's needed weight and i never felt it was an excuse to show a naked breast or anything like that but unfortunately the climax of the story comes well before the end and the end itself feels kind of flat even if in its own way kind of dramatic br br the cast is impressive spearheaded by known actors like nicholas cage and judge reinhold but the show is almost completely stolen by erika anderson beautiful and very adept at acting out the sometimes subtle feelings of desire she excels were both cage and reinhold sometimes goes a bot overboard and become a little rough her career afterward is too thin for the talent she shows in zandalee i can only hope it is because of her own choices also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give some extra edge to the movie it is steve buscemi and joe pantoliano br br when you're in the right mood this is a very good movie it could have used another end to get the credit it really deserves br br 7 10
<START> basically there's a family where a little boy jake thinks there's a zombie in his closet his parents are fighting all the time br br this movie is slower than a soap opera and suddenly jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie br br ok first of all when you're going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama as a drama the movie is watchable parents are divorcing arguing like in real life and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots br br 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents descent dialogs as for the shots with jake just ignore them
<START> this is a wonderful film the non stop patter takes several watchings to fully appreciate the musical productions of busby berkeley will never be duplicated i think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts joan blondell and james cagney are incredible together some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of today's movies put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is
<START> david lynch's new short is a very lynchian piece full of darkness tension silences discreet but very textured background music and features again two beautiful actresses a blonde and a brunette a recurrent theme in his work br br both characters create a very intriguing slave mistress relationship that could be seen as a direct follow up to the same kind of relationship featured in mulholland dr br br beautiful for lynch fan's br br
<START> bad acting bad lighting bad plot this had the quality of a porno movie i have seen more interesting home video of a boring wedding than this movie it sucked big time don't waste your time or money on this crap it's amazing that they allow this kind of smut to even be released on video it should be a crime
<START> the flock is not really a movie it's a wannabe movie with wannabe actors not including richard gere he gave an excellent performance but when only one of the actors truly gives himself to his character and the rest of the cast is just acting the result is pathetic just like this movie you see the idea of acting is to hide the fact that you're acting what the hell was claire dains doing in this one she's the most inappropriate actress for this character in 99 9 of the movie she looked extremely out of place out of everything the only thing she was doing was asking stupid questions like do you really think so and making silly faces i was embarrassed by her acting seriously and i used to like her she's the romantic movie type i don't know who picked her among all the actresses out there lol and seeing avril lavigne this really made me laugh anyway if you want to get the feeling of throwing up this movie will do the job for you i wish i could vote 5
<START> thomas clay has been mixing with the wrong types that's the trouble with young people these days they have no respect br br seriously this film should be avoided at all costs the action in the main body of the film is slow and rather stodgy and ambles to the drug crazed ending as if like it's director it has no where better to go we are introduced to the main title character who is a bit of an outsider we see him at school and at home not quite fitting in feeling awkward in himself as so many adolescents do robert falls in with bad lads and starts missing school and taking drugs and before you know it he is a psycho rapist br br the film is really about clay's total failure to understand the links between violence imagery and violent acts clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our tvs yet he has filmed the most disgusting piece of simulated violence is this guy for real br br if clay has not seen youtube perhaps he is naive and unaware of will be done with the brutal climax scene from his film all anyone will want to see is the most hideous scene from the end of the film and i am sure that will be what sticks with people br br the rest of the film is pointless for in committing such an act of violence to film clay not only damns young people who are actively engaged in preventing war he also damns himself as perpetrator of extreme tasteless violence for no better reason than his own personal celebrity status br br shame on all involved
<START> but it's certainly not without merit already writer director preston sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue no wonder the coen brothers' next movie is going to be an homage to sturges br br the major problem is that the plot's not all the way there yet it lacks surprise the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing the coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon and the ending is thoroughly predictable frank capra does this sort of thing much better br br if you're new to preston sturges check out the lady eve or sullivan's travels or the miracle of morgan's creek first if you've seen these already then go ahead and watch this one
<START> recreation of 1950's london soho and the up and coming people based on a cult novel br br julian temple is a video director no more no less give him 15 million dollars and he will make you a 15 million dollar pop video here he forgets that two minutes with people that can't really act is one thing but two hours what was he thinking of besides who are the audience who cares about a book that was well remembered way back when the usual london story of the chancer taking his chance br br what could really drag this film even further down oh i know third rate songs that sound like they were made up on the spot david bowie crones the film title over and over a few times and that is the highlight the soundtrack album is clay pigeon material br br there is one good thing though good recreation of period soho shame they couldn't think of anything to put in front of it
