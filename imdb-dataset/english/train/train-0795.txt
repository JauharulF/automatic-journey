<START> an overblown melodrama typical of its period mid 1950s and appropriate matinÃ©e food rock hudson the hulk everyone always falls in love with plays his usual stereotype role but whereas in giant made the same year when his material and co stars taylor dean were above average in this movie he is just not good enough to raise the calibre beyond a mushy tale of how difficult it is to be both rich and happy the self destructive brother and sister robert stack reeling his way through the film in a drunken stupor and dorothy malone playing a vampish poor little rich girl totally over the top end up the losers and hudson gets bacall who is rather wooden in this part which does not have enough character or wit to get her going to paraphrase oscar wilde the good end happily and the bad unhappily that is the meaning of fiction however i was interested to read that the film is based on a true story which vindicated the plot like other films of the period homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms maybe the film could be remade stack's character would ring truer if he was hiding homosexual feelings for mitch by marrying todd haynes's far from heaven greatly improved on all that heaven allows also directed by sirk perhaps haynes could remake written on the wind and give us a truly memorable film
<START> this is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge i found the first 10 minutes a bit slow but after that the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living br br some of the scenes are very funny i don't think that a non bridge player would get the charm of this movie br br some of the dresses are really beautiful pity the movie is in black and white i can only imagine what they would look like in color the way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious there is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that br br watch it as soon as you can and tell your friends about it
<START> this movie was bad from the start the only purpose of the movie was that angela wanted to get a high body count the acting was horrible the killings were acted out very badly like when ally got stuffed down that toilet i guess it was in the abandoned cabin but when the end of the movie comes and molly and the other guy are in the cabin you see ally so angela must have gone in to get her the part that really got me was when the black girl and angela were in the cabin and angela took the guitar string and chocked her one it was horrible acting and two why wouldn't you just turn around and punch the bitch then when molly is getting chased by angela if you have the neigh why not just turn around and stab her so stupid this movie sucked
<START> coonskin might be my favorite ralph bakshi film like the best of his work it's in your face and not ashamed of it for a second but unlike some of his other work even when he's at his finest which was before and after coonskin with heavy traffic and wizards it's not much uneven despite appearances to the contrary bakshi's taking on stereotypes and perceptions of race of course but moreover he's making what appears to be a freewheeling exploitation film blaxploitation almost though bakshi doesn't stop just there if it were just a blaxploitation flick with inventive animation it could be enough for a substantial feature but bakshi's aims are higher throwing up these grotesque and exaggerated images of not just black people but italians mafioso homosexuals jews overall new york types in the urban quarters of manhattan in the 70s he isn't out to make anything realistic the most normal looking creation in looking drawn real is in fact a naked woman painted red white and blue br br in mocking these stereotypes and conventions and horrible forms of racism i e the tar rabbit baby joke yes joke plus black face we're looking at abstraction to a grand degree and best of all bakshi doesn't take himself too seriously unlike spike lee with a film like bamboozled in delivering his message this is why for the most part coonskin is a hilarious piece of work where some of the images and things done and sudden twists and of course scenes of awkward behavior i loved the scene where the three animated characters are being talked at by the real life white couple in tux and dress as looking colorful and the like are just too much not to laugh at it's not just the imagery which is in and of itself incredibly over stylized but that the screenplay is sharp and this is key for bakshi this time considering it's got a fairly cohesive narrative to string along the improvisations and madness br br using at first live action then animation and then an extremely clever matching of the two ironically what bakshi later went for in commercial form with cool world is done here to a t with less money and a rougher edge pappy and randy are waiting outside a prison wall for a buddy to escape and pappy tells of the story of brother rabbit who with brother bear and preacher fox go to harlem and become big time hoodlums with rabbit in direct opposition to a jabba the hut esquire godfather character this is obviously a take off on song of the south with its intentionally happy go lucky plot and animation here taken apart and shown for how rotten and offensive it really is br br yet bakshi goes for broke in combining forms animated characters stand behind and move along with live action backgrounds when violence and gunshots and fights occurs it's as bloody as it can get for 1975 when a dirty cop is at a bar and is drugged and put in black face and a dress he trips in a manner of which not even disney could reach with dumbo a boxing match with brother bear and an opponent as the climax is filmed in wild slow motion archive footage comes on from time to time of old movies some and some from the 20s that are just tasteless br br like mel brooks or kubrick or more recently south park bakshi's coonskin functions as entertainment first and then thought provocation second it's also audacious film making on an independent scale everything from the long takes to the montage and the endlessly warped designs for the characters however all based on the theme of the piece all serve the thought in the script where its b movie plot opens up much more for interpretation to call it racist misses the point it's like calling dr strangelove pro atomic desolation or confederate states of america pro slavery and for me it's one of the best satires ever made
<START> while i don't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies stardust intrigued me based on seeing michelle pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain especially since i was about to see her as the bossy velma von tussle in hairspray boy is she so convincingly evil here as a witch especially with her age ugly makeup in the beginning and end robert de niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide in the closet to protect his reputation just about all the actors like claire danes rupert everett ricky gervais peter o'toole and many others do fine work here while danes and pfeiffer are classic beauties there's also stunning faces of sienna miller olivia grant as girl bernard and kate magowan especially when we first meet her newcomer charlie cox is fine as the lead tristan and he looked so much like his father dunstan as a young man that i thought that was him in early scenes with magowan actually ben barnes many comments have compared this to the princess bride and while i can see some resemblances the main difference was that with pb you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson stardust makes you believe for the most part that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout so on that note i highly recommended stardust
<START> it's hard to find an outright bad historical drama that's based on the life of any number of british monarchs just take a well respected british or australian actor make things look pretty and you're guaranteed a formula for oscar success br br the young victoria is no exception getting just about everything right the cinematography striking and beautiful with soft lights and lush colors and fabrics starring emily blunt in a role she can finally soar in the film begins with victoria's 18th birthday and moves through the intrigue and issues that surrounded her eventual rise to the throne and her famous marriage to prince albert rupert friend as the young victoria herself laments she's moved like a chess pawn by a variety of parties as she finds her footing and her voice as one of britain's most influential rulers br br while this moving around the chess board is fairly typical territory it is the development of victoria's relationship with albert that makes the film slightly more interesting i confess i have a degree in history with a specialization in the victorian era so i'm a bit attached to these figures despite their many flaws as rulers victoria and albert were some of the first leaders devoted to improving civilization for their people they left their legacy in the arts in public health and education and in victoria's conservative views and mourning culture after albert's death but these things are only briefly hinted at during the film br br it is fairly well established that victoria and albert were not only madly in love but held a level of respect for each other not usually seen between monarchs in arranged marriages even if it did occur behind the scenes their's was certainly one of the best known blunt and and friend have just the right type of chemistry to do the famous pair justice the proper mix of restraint and desperation it's a different love not usually shown on screen especially in this sort of film it's encouraging to finally see a relationship in which man and woman are on a equal playing field br br but we don't get to see that love enough while the filmmakers try to fit the affair amongst the political trappings it doesn't quite build up the sort of momentum needed to keep the tension high also without delving into the more advanced important public work of the pair things feel a bit in limbo superficial instead of intimate and sometimes confusing it's not as big an issue during the film but afterward the effects wear off rather quickly and you find yourself trying to remember what you just watched despite the perfect performances by the leads most noticeably blunt who even captures the famous monarch's expressions br br for as much as it tries victoria succeeds on many levels but lacks that certain sparkle that would take it from solid to classic
<START> there is not much more i can say about this movie than all of the commentaries on page one except as jesse says it's the berries all of page one's commentators wrote eloquently as almost so as the dialog is in this movie this just may be one of those illusive things we hear so much about but usually are made so by the actors who deliver the lines a beautiful script maybe robert redford did hold strict sway onto the actors actresses during the filming of this movie so that the beauty of the story would not get lost br br i too attended church when i was very young and into my late teens the church's pastor spoke very eloquently and quietly as the rev maclean did in his church that in itself is a totally different picture that is portrayed of southern baptist churches no holy rollering in my church it was a big church with many different programs to keep its congregation busy the most inspiring perhaps was the music department with its huge choir and almost classical anthems too the sunday evening congregation was almost entirely younger people are you even aware it was once safe to go to church on sunday night how i wish it still was watching a river runs through it is very much like going to hear a beautiful sermon in a church whose members are fully involved in life as has already been so beautifully written the sermon for this movie is the open space beauties of montana yet aren't there also missile silos there too fly fishing or any other activity which draws family members closer together for a happy life and deep understanding of one another becomes a blessing although you see some of the shadier aspects of life then too the simplicity of the story paints a lasting impression on your heart if you let it speakeasies and prostitutes are counter balanced by the simple gatherings of old fashioned community picnics as this movie contains in heavy contrasts to modern families taking their kids to disney land for screeching joyrides and calling it a day together there is noting wrong with that but as river demonstrates some of its taciturn beauty could do nothing but make life richer this is the third film i've seen in which tom skeritt plays a father all different styles and brilliantly acted br br brad pitt mostly an undiscovered talent except for thelma and louise and meet joe black and all of the cast members deserved many awards little stories superbly told will get 10 of 10 from me over any movie with violence foul language ugliness and action i am thinking particularly of crash and most of arnold's movies what a savior for peace this movie is
<START> what if a platoon of g i 's from the japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the tokugawa shogunate great pitch right the movie does exactly what it says on the tin br br thankfully the writers didn't bother to explain the usually ridiculous in sci fi movies scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport no how's or why's they just did however the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful if not a bit dated not as silly as one would imagine br br the rest of the movie follows the premise to a t but while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the g i s arrival to medieval japan it picks up with a devastating battle sequence undoubtedly it's the main order of the day the whole concept and by extension the movie itself was probably originated from this simple pitch what if g i 's equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurais and boy does it deliver br br the main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in 70's action war movies not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length it's also a terrific mish mash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like g i samurai can deliver i mean where else would you get the chance to feature tanks ninjas complete with shuriikens a helicopter and samurais in the same shot the g i platoon led by lieutenant iba tears literally through hundreds of extras gunning them down with machine guns mortars grenades and tanks br br this mish mash of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidai geki epic of kurosawa's kagemusha or hiroshi inagaki's samurai banners while the other is in western action and war movies there are stylistic touches like the wonderful slow motion shots and bloody violence that bring sam peckinpah or enzo g castellari circa keoma to mind japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other hollywood works and vice versa and g i samurai effortlessly turns this east meets west melting pot into an exciting film br br the film makers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it not that tongue in cheek mentality is completely absent it's just that it doesn't try to pander to so bad it's good audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies the budget was probably hefty as it is evident in the hundreds of extras elaborate costumes very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidai geki and special effects the camera work and editing are all top notch almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions deserves br br it's not withouts its flaws either of course there are many song scenes where all sorts of 70's japanese rock disco and country songs play over montages there's a bonding scene a love interest scene a war is hell scene etc the songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing although it clocks at a whooping 140 minutes it flies like a bullet for the most part still some scenes flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effect br br the cast also deserves a mention featuring such prominent names as sonny chiba isao natsuyagi goyokin samurai wolf tsunehiko watase the yakuza papers and hiroyuki sanada all of them hitting the right notes
<START> i admit i've only seen about three of shakespeare's plays romeo juliet macbeth of course hamlet one i liked the other i found so so macbeth and hamlet i just found a masterpiece i'm pleased to tell you that this adaptation is every bit as good as the intense and dramatic play the acting is extremely strong with a cast that features kenneth branagh robin williams and billy crystal how can you lose and the change in time period looks like somewhere between the 17 and 1800's plays off beautifully as the characters move about and say their infamous lines straight from the script itself that any fan of the shakespearean play will get chills from if you're into this popular drama i highly urge you to watch this powerful 1996 adaptation from shakespearean admirer kenneth branagh
<START> i wonder how the actors acted in this movie annette bening was really herself half in and half out was she faking or being natural it didn't make any difference considering that even if she had been walking on the ceiling it would not have changed the pattern of the film brian cox acted really well i almost thought that he had always acted this way tricky dishonest in a dirty surrounding where nobody really cared about hygiene as for gwyneth paltrow the question is what she was doing in this film br br this film is quite sickening and disgusting who would pay to see such a crap
<START> i originally reviewed this film on amazon about 6 or 7 years ago and blasted it i believe i called it wretched and a turkey okay well by most standards it's still a turkey it's got almost no production values what little plot there is makes almost no sense and the acting is on the level of a third grade play that said this has really grown on me over the years as a sort of camp classic in fact all of director todd sheets' films have had this effect they're almost like ed wood in that regard watch them over and over and pick out the flubbed lines continuity errors same zombie two different locations and other flaws br br i'll say this sheets is a very nice guy and while this one of his first productions isn't that great he has gotten better and i must add that the only really decent actor actress in the film is kasey rousch though i may be biased as i attended school with her
<START> this movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by anthony mann and james stewart like winchester '73 and the naked spur and much better than thunder bay and bend of the river this film starts out like a run of the mill western but gets more complex as it goes along it starts out with jimmy stewart and walter brennan arriving in seattle and stewart is charged with murder he is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge stewart then agrees to lead something but i forget what it is but stewart only cares about getting his cattle back as the movie goes along it's like stewart only cares about himself just like his character in the naked spur it gets much better at the halfway point after they arrive in alaska this is one of stewart's better westerns
<START> this was a rip off of the same garbage we had to watch bob saget host during the half hour before this dave coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as america's funniest home videos except with a hosts who have a combined iq of three tawny kitaen must've really needed the money and coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his jokes it was torture enough having to see him imitate popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on full house that one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a grade a wedgie coulier must've needed to money to please alannis morisette while they were dating
<START> br br if you're at all interested in pirates pirate movies new orleans early 19th century american history or yul brynner see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it don't be put off by various lacklustre reviews my reaction to it was that it is entertaining well acted for the most part has some very witty dialogue and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer jean lafitte while not all the events in the film are historically accurate can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this i feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role lafitte played in new orleans' history and the love hate relationship between the respectable citizens of new orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons don't worry about what the film doesn't do but watch it for what it does do i e for its study of one of new orleans' and america's most intriguing historical figures
<START> oh dear me rarely has a horror film bored me or made me laugh as much as this one after a spirited start with an intriguing premise it descends into not much more than a slasher flick with some supernatural and sexual asides the usually excellent alice krige is wasted in this one and the plot twists are ludicrous don't bother unless you're really desperate rating 3 10
<START> i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business who are now still trying to become adults no more fans groupies money etc and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight it is almost like they have to begin anew this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the 70's and 80's are going through now and that's where i find the film sad and depressing but it portrays the life of an old rock star abandoned and lost in a believable way the young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren outrageous and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for this film is a must have for folks in their 50's who have seen the rise and fall of bands people who knew the members and have watched them hurt as age creeps in and popularity fades this is an almost perfect movie sad but in a way positive because of the whales a must see
<START> some nice scenery but the story itself in which a self proclaimed egyptologist lesley anne down visits egypt and in the course of doing egyptologist things in the most un egyptologistic of ways e g flash photography in the tombs the handling of old parchment etc uncovers a black market turf war and somehow in the span of two days no less becomes that war's jumpsuit wearing epicenter is more puzzling than any riddle the sphinx ever posed down is simply awful as the visiting british scholar that she seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of egypt and even less about antiquities is the fault of the writers certainly but that she's annoying as all get out is her own fault entirely and the rest of the cast including sir john gielgud and frank langella seem as downright confused by the proceedings as i was in short not what you'd expect from schaffner planet of the apes patton and co br br worth watching for a laughably dated scene in which down rails against all male scholars blaming them for her failure as an academic while bathed under the softest light hollywood could muster to top it off she spends the next hour of the film shrieking and harried and running into the arms of any dude she can find wow talk about your performative irony br br note to would be egyptologists take a year or two of arabic in grad school it'll really help out in the long run
<START> in a very short time the movie showed a boy's odd life of taking pictures showed his life and everyone else's get turned upside down as a result of his photographs then brought everything back to normal in the end one to see if you're looking for something interesting
<START> this is a pleasant film even if the premise is silly it was sort of a guilty pleasure to watch meg ryan seems to be able to pull off roles in this kind of film another example is joe vs the volcano that's what makes her a star in part walter matthau of course had that ability too and he really puts himself into the role making an amusing good hearted einstein i suppose you could say they're both good at portraying loveable characters though loveable in different ways loveable young women vs loveable curmudgeon
<START> in 1958 clarksberg was a famous speed trap town much revenue was generated by the sheriff's department catching speeders the ones who tried to outrun the sheriff well that gave the sheriff a chance to push them off the clarksberg curve with his plymouth cruiser for example in the beginning of the movie a couple of servicemen on leave trying to get back to base on time are pushed off to their deaths if i recall correctly then one day a stranger drove into town possibly the coolest hot rodder in the world michael mccord even his name is a car name as in mccord gaskets in possibly the ultimate hot rod a black flamed '34 ford coupe the colors of death evil and hellfire he gets picked up for speeding by the sheriff on purpose he checks out the lay of the land he is the brother of one of the sheriff's victims he knows how his brother died the clarksberg government is all in favor of the sheriff there's only one way to get justice served for the killing of his brother and to fix things so this ain't a ever gonna happen again to anyone recreate the chase and settle the contest hot rodder style to the death he goes out to the curve and practices the sheriff knows mccord knows the race begins this is a movie to be remembered by anyone who ever tried to master maneuvering on a certain stretch of road
