<START> celia johnson is good as the nurse michael hordern is good as capulet though it's his usual neighing and whinnying and not a patch on his king lear john o'conor reads the verse well as friar laurence though he never takes it anywhere alan rickman is good as tybalt in the first of his yuk roles that would make him famous christopher strauli's benvolio is sympathetic br br the sets are pretty if not stunning as in some of the other bbc shakespeare's br br and that's it the rest is weak to dreadful rebecca saire turned 15 during production and hasn't a clue about how to act juliet she opens her eyes real wide and whines every line in exactly the same way patrick ryecart is poorly matched to her and his self regard is inexplicable the balcony scene flows smoothly and uneventfully with zero emotional or erotic impact their deaths come as a relief if i had a dagger i would have offered it to them hours earlier br br anthony andrews is unspeakable as mercutio a great shock if you remember his fine work in brideshead revisited he breaks the mirror of shakespeare's verse into a thousand shards of two or three words each and then shouts the fragments in as disconnected and unintelligible manner as possible in this production queen mab abdicates awful br br the director alvin rakoff shows only an intermittent gift of putting the camera where it will show us what we want to see the opening brawl is notably incoherent however there is humor when in a later fight romeo apparently knees tybalt right in the cobblers tybalt then grabs the offended region however did that get through br br r j is a long play this version is not recommended for classroom use or much else
<START> what happened in the making of this movie so that it ended up as the total mess it is just one year after the breakfast club a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in st elmo's fire who by the way looked and acted in the latter more like they were still the high school misfits from the former but without the grip or discipline in portraying their roles br br was it the directing or the writing since it was the same person joel schumacher it must be both but then schumacher has since given us the phantom of the opera phone booth a time to kill and two batman movies batman and robin and batman forever which range from good to great directing something went wrong on stef because it has no genius whatsoever no comedy worth anything and is very far off the mark on what is truly valuable in life br br example the character wendy a rich little girl with a heart to do good and help the less fortunate played by mare winningham reveals to billy an unruly slob who cheats on his wife and on his girlfriends drinks far too much and has no sense of order in his life appropriately played by rob lowe that she is still a virgin billy truly see a challenge and possible conquest but wendy is not ready wendy in fact is so not ready it is hard to believe she is in this clique of friends later in the story when billy whose wife has left him taken his child and married another has somehow drawn some of the strings of his life together billy is leaving for new york deserting and abandoning all parental responsibility for his baby daughter he convinces wendy that her virginity would be the perfect going away gift from her to him and wendy who works as a social worker helping broken families seems not to be phased at all by this despot give me a break the one thing she can only give once she gives to a loser who is leaving his family and friends schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and touching moment br br many more example exist where there is a complete disconnect between what is real and of value being tossed overboard and the acts are made to look like virtue br br i suppose some may say that that was the 80's but i remember it was in the 80's that men began to be held responsible for the children they fathered whether in a marriage or out br br i think this movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it really valuable and right br br as for the technique not the story it was terrible as well it is disjointed and feels like a 3 hour movie that has been edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense pick up what is on the editing room floor put it back in and the movie would probably flow much better but it still is a horrible movie br br maybe schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986 he must have or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing the screenplay for st elmo's fire or maybe this group of actors took over the set and went their own way that is what i really think happened
<START> i've just seen the saint strikes back for the first time and found it quite good this was george sanders's first appearance as the saint where he replaces louis hayward br br in this one the saint is sent to san francisco to investigate a shooting at a night club with the help of his acquaintance inspector fernack who has come down from new york they help a daughter of a crime boss br br joining sanders in the cast are wendy barrie and jonathan hale br br not a bad saint movie worth seeing br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> when i sat down to watch this film i actually expected quite a bit as the plot takes on quite complex issues using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach still unfortunately despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between muslim and western culture adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays lesbians it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film this leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with br br however this does not mean that the film is directly bad as it's rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing the film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep this has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts by this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation br br even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when the ball drops this way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard clichÃ© that becomes ridiculous in its happy ending nothing is left out in the hollywood like ending so even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages one can't help but roll eyes towards the resolution personally i was close to shouting finish already at the screen br br there were some decent acting in the film and the two young female central characters had some good moments so did their parents and other bi characters however the handsome irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism he didn't even appear very likable but rather self involved despite his good deeds which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained br br i give the film a 4 as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from the script and cast had many good believable characters giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others had the let downs not been this disappointing i'd easily give the film a 7 or 8 if you enjoyed this film i'd recommend the film east is east which i think is an as good if not better rendering of cultural conflict as well as being amusing and engaging
<START> i fail to see the appeal of this series which is supposed to be sci fi it's really just let's see what soap operatically happens this week and oh the cylons are involved through flashbacks br br the cylon babe that keeps nailing the other guy is pretty lame it's pretty obvious that t a was added to the show every time she pops up i'm bewildered as to wtf is supposed to be going on and don't even try to bullsh t me about story arcs br br it's a soap opera with some cgi thrown in this is not science fiction aside from the original premise br br this series is not everything it's worked up to be if you like trendy edgy dodgy jumpy vague editor on crack camera work this show might be for you since nerds seem to be raving about this show it's a clear indication that vocal nerds' opinions have been changed from picard's tng
<START> why didn't the producers give that show a chance of all the junk on tv why didn't the producers give six degrees a chance will the series go on video i would love to see how it ends put season one on video and sell it i was a loyal fan of six degrees and waited for it's return i set my recorder to tape all of the shows thank god for that i just found out that the show was canceled and i'm heart broken i wish i knew it was going to be canceled why didn't they tell us i thought the show was just developing some depth in the characters the writing was pretty good also steven campbell scott is my all time favorite i am so sorry to see it go
<START> when i started to watch this movie on vh 1 i cringed the mtv movies were all bad so i wasnt expecting much but this movie was really good i liked it a lot and it even had a twist at the end see this movie because it shows that made for tv movies that are good exist
<START> the film is poorly casted except for some familiar old hollywood names other performances by unknown names i e jennifer gabrielle are uninspiring i have seen other films by this director unfortunately this is one of his worst perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay br br in a positive note kim bassinger's and pat morita's performance saved the movie from oblivion i enjoyed pat more in karate kid though there are many good movies to see and in short this one is not one of them save your money and the celluloid br br jason vanness
<START> kiera nightly moved straight from the p p set to this action movie she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically a great success in love actually and as lizie in jane austen's classic she is once again having a go just as her bikini clad warrier woman in king arthur was more skin than muscle it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life but then this is exactly what domino harvey the real one did and i being one of nightly's biggest fans believe she carries if off br br stuff br br 90210 for the non american world is the post code of beverly hills in la where all the film stars live domino harvey father's mostfamous film was manchurian candidate which appears in the film domino harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in june 2005 after having been arrested for drug dealing she had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film kiera knightly alludes to domino harvey's sexuality in her interview with lucy liu br br if you find this film a bit far fetched then check out domino harvey as the facts are more amazing than the fiction
<START> horror sci fi that is interesting as it is laughable f x pretty good for what you manage to see a made for tv thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them jeffrey coombs plays a brilliant although misguided scientist that tampers with stem cell research and manipulates human dna with that of a hammerhead shark the horrifying results give birth to one hell of a killing machine a group of scientists led by william forsythe and hunter tylo are invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment of course after laughing and stammering in awe coombs' creation by the way is his own son fused with a hammerhead is let loose to hunt down one by one his father's colleagues revenge is not always rewarding also in the cast elsie muller g r johnson arthur roberts and velizar binev
<START> like a latter day ayn rand bigelow is la major muy macho in her depiction in the film of a few tough american hombres stuck in iraq defusing roadside bombs set by the ruthless relentless child killing arab terrorists as bigelow posits the iraq war as the backdrop of the grand stage of human drama one veteran bomb expert gets blown up and another shows up to replace him in the dusty hot ugly rubble that is iraq and a new hero is born br br the new guy is what john hershey described in his book and later the movie the war lover as a sadistic wingnut who actually isn't fit for civilian life and requires the stimulation of war to sublimate and suppress his errant sexual desires the war lover can only fully function in war peacetime suffocates him while hershey chastised the war lover played in the film by steve mcqueen in one of his greatest roles bigelow glorifies him the army needs war lovers they are the bulwark of defense against our enemies we can't handle the truth that it is war lovers who are the best soldiers the toughest men according to the unironic bigelow regular men are pussies the war lover is a special breed the last of the cowboys so what if he wants to bare back his men or fondle an iraqi boy he is a throwback to the sex and death cult of war in war sex is a thankless loveless don't ask don't tell kind of male bonding bigelow has no opinion on this she just limits the options of masculinity in this ham fisted attempt at realism only a war lover can win the moral struggle between right and wrong between american innocence and arab perfidy bigelow disguises her racism and arrogance behind the ingenuous facade of journalism she's just another gung ho yahoo depicting a brutal war against civilians as a moral triumph of the spirit br br on the political front bigelow returns to the western genre and its relentless clichÃ©s again and again ad nauseam the wonderful world of the open frontier which happens to be some one else's country you can shoot people here says a soldier the tough but human black guy companion the soldier with a premonition of death the gruff possibly crazy commanding officer the college educated fool who tries to befriend the enemy you name it bigelow resurrects it br br the man boy love is palpable in scenes with the cute arab boy who befriends the war lover but bigelow plays it straight she doesn't consummate the sex just sanitizes it what bigelow really wants to show us is the ugly sneering face of the arab enemy any iraqi who isn't pure evil is either demented hostile or up to no good anyway they all deserve to die for their impudence and many of them do in this glib gore fest film the iraqi women are all hysterical they only make their presence known by screaming they could be male stunt men in drag for all i know you never see their faces there is no female presence at all on base or in battle although female casualty rates in iraq would certainly disprove this br br bigelow goes through all the motions one by one she glorifies war she canonizes the sadist nut case hero the cowboys surrounded by the subhuman indians prove their mettle by doing god's work and subduing the wretched terrorist infested hellhole with sheer bravado and suicidal mania toward the end i felt like rooting for the indians in bigelow's world though no mercy or understanding ever makes it through the iraqis are dehumanized par excellence the slaughter of civilians is just the dramatic backdrop to our hero's psycho sexual struggle every u s bullet finds its mark you have to love the guy the war lover it's just his way he is the true hero he's just a guy trying to get things done the hard way and so what if he lusts for boy tang on the side
<START> i just can't believe some of the comments on this show the show is just genius sure it doesn't follow the tried and true but do we as consumers always want the same things thrust at us over and over again shouldn't we have the option to sit back and enjoy something new once in a while the style is not as realistic as previous scooby doo shows but it's not supposed to be the show it titled shaggy and scooby doo get a clue what part of that title states that the entire beloved cast of other renditions would constantly join in the action and nowhere does it say that they'd be solving mysteries and they can't even stand monsters so why would they i'm actually glad that they put some long standing plot points that work into a scooby doo show they still have running jokes clumsy hi jinks quick change outfits in chase scenes the standard hallway gag and even scooby snacks in fact i'm glad that this show is out there because i just love it i'm even glad they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and concentrated on just two main characters and a villain br br sure it's ridiculous it's supposed to be sure it's different it's supposed to be it's supposed to make you laugh at the villain and cheer for the idiotic robotic butler to triumph over all intruding vermin no matter what the size you're supposed to get the running roobi roo joke the whole thing is just put together so well there isn't a single thing i can think that is wrong with it the writing the acting the animation all top notch the title music is awesome my computer plays get a clue when it boots up and the background music is just gripping
<START> i remembered the title so well to me it was a flora robson movie with olivier and vivien leigh in supporting roles and it had vincent massey's voice from behind whiskers well flora robson was great her next signature for me would be 55 days at peking the same role but with different sumptuous gowns and the same voice as for the armada it was a subtext i like black and white films was everything done in elizbethan times at night it was talky and difficult to fathom at times i couldn't tell which was the love interest was it the spaniard or was it vivien leigh and i do not believe that elizabeth i would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the armada apparently it worked for the empire but not for the script this might have been more accurate historically but bette davis had more engaging scripts and i missed daylight
<START> this film deals with two ex football players who are fred williamson mack derringer and gary busey lenny who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of ladies and men with some bad backgrounds mack derringer is approached by his ex wife vanity jennifer derringer who works at having sex talk over the telephone jennifer is being threatened by one caller who wants to do horrible things to her and she asks for his help along with several other ladies mack lenny have more time on their hands and often go to miami fl golf courses or hang out in a sports bar where all kinds of city things go on there is lots of punches killings and plenty of double meaning words that bring this film completely down to a big zero don't waste your time this film cost me only 50 cents and that was too much
<START> i hated this movie so much i remember it vividly it is not even funny any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it in the first half hour rob schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk all i could think was he deserves it for making such a bad movie don't waste your time or money on this one
<START> only saw this show a few times but will live in my memory br br it is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find this anywhere to purchase and yet there seem to be endless repeats of stuff like friends especially even more difficult to obtain being in england i guess br br they say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from the bakersfield pd themselves maybe it was just too clever for certain people br br anyhow just about the one comedy i would love to see again but is almost impossible to find i hear it is being or has been repeated on another network but alas not over here br br summary ingenious
<START> the basic storyline here is aditiya kumar is the spoilt son of a millionaire ishwar bachan who owns a toy industry in ishwar's eyes his son aditya can do nothing wrong aditya's mother sumitra shefali shah warns ishwar to bring his son to the responsible path before it is too late for ishwar is a patient of lung cancer and has only 9 months to live when his son elopes and marries mitali chopra ishwar readily forgives aditya but when the happy couple aditya and mitali come back from a honeymoon mitali is pregnant and this forces ishwar to kick aditya out of the house to make him more responsible aditya doesn't know his father is suffering from lung cancer and he also doesn't know that his father has kicked him out of the hose to make him more responsible ishwar cannot bring himself to tall aditya that he is about to die with a hungry and pregnant wife it is a race against time so aditya does all he can to prove himself to his father and the climax comes when aditya gets his big break in the movie industry and his father tells him that he is about to die br br this movie is absolutely brilliant this is the breakthrough in indian cinema that was needed for the bollywood industry shah's directing is almost flawless but which movie doesn't have flaws the best part if this movie is the father son relationship which is a tearjerker the song interludes is just placed at the right time the scenery is good the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between boman irani and rajpal yadav the jokes are too long and after a bit they are annoying but overall this is a brilliant movie i advise anybody reading this review to go and watch it regardless of other reviews 9 10
<START> i was attracted to seeing this movie because of this plot and my desire to watch a horror br br to my disappointment this turned into more of a comedy than a horror the acting dialog and flow of the movie was all very poorly done much of it didn't make sense for example there's a party of about 30 people and they're all terrified of one person despite them being at a secret location and are all healthy looking young adults and the guy threatening them sounds haggard i kept thinking maybe this was a parody of another movie like scary movie but they were trying too hard to make it look gruesome emphasis on try br br the blood and gore are also poorly done i've seen halloween costumes look more believable than this a guy with his head cut clean off looked clean missing signs bone flesh blood and even the head a strong downward strike with an ax on a corpse should lodge itself into something seemed like the guy was swinging a bat instead of an ax br br revealing who the main villain was supposed to be a twist but contradicted other parts in the story what was going in the guy's mind to turn out like that if there was going to be a twist you should at least build up to it adding mystery and suspense
<START> this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn't there be two or more shadows for each object when apollo 11 went through the van allan radiation belts they spent 30 min's there not the 90 min's claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray br br seriously do some research learn what really happened don't let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened
<START> i'd just like to say that i've seen this film twice now and i love it the acting is great and even though it is a similar plot to raise your voice i think that the plot never gets boring for people who like that kind of thing it has some great lessons in it and shows us that we can do anything if we try an incredible film i am sure that this is one i will be watching for a long time to come even though britney spears write the book it is quite a realistic plot maybe not about the falling in love part but the part about being different and struggling but coming out best in the end is very true to real life the only minor criticism is why is the main girl in these films always beautiful do you really think that holly would have met the perfect guy of her dreams if she was ugly or average i doubt it
