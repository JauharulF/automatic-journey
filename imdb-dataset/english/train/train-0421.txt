<START> this has to be one of the top overrated anime shows ever made and yes i was even shown the end of evangelion and that still made me hate it even more not to mention the countless rip offs of this show br br i don't mind psychological and philosophy untertones but evangelion drags it out into the mud like nothing else not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting the only ones that seemed to be interesting were asuka misato and pen pen other than that mostly everyone else were a bunch of whiny crybaby losers they need to go to a psyciatric center not piloting giant robots against aliens called angels br br even the mecha and alien fights did not help at all goes something like this br br well there are these robots and they are really cool because they bleed when they get hurt but they are not really mecha but captured angels so sometimes they go insane and don't do what the underaged pilots want and they have to be controlled better blah blah blah br br i am so sorry but i just cannot recommend evangelion to anyone anime otakus or not to those who love this series greatly fine you're entitled to that opinion i respect you but to thoses that have a out of your mind obsession to think that every one will like this series you are more of an egotist br br i prefer macross mospeada run dim and robot taekwon v myself
<START> i recently watched spirit and enjoyed it very much i've seen it about 4 times now on hbo and will buy the dvd those who gave negative reviews would probably think that vanishing point' was just another car chase movie and thelma louise' was just another chick flick although the conclusions of those films are darker i feel the themes are somewhat related that freedom and individualism are very important and that there is usually someone wanting to take it away from you the other common trait of these movies is the caring thoughtful guardian angel' types who help the main characters to overcome adversity br br another review here mentions how this film relates to the theme of civilization invading someone else's home all one has to do is look around at the dwindling open areas around us to see that br br i thought the animation and the story were amazing the animators really got the horses to look act and move naturally spirit's emotions were very clear as the story progressed yes i'm aware they do humanize the horses a bit but this is fiction in a couple of action scenes you feel caught in the current of the rapids and the heat from a forest fire in other more quiet scenes which are most of the time you're allowed to savor the backgrounds one of the big things that make the story really work is by not going the talking singing animals route doing so would take away from the story's power instead the flow of the story is told by occasional narration by the main character further punch is added by the fantastic soundtrack another plus is that they weren't afraid to give the story somewhat of a dark side which really made this film watchable to me this isn't prevalent through the entire movie though and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting without being sappy br br those who appreciate horses will really like this movie but i think it's a bit more than a horse movie i don't feel this would be a good movie to take children to if they're brought up on the inane fare that's offered up today but if they're the thoughtful sort that can handle compelling stories like the lord of the rings and black beauty they'll likely love this movie hell i'm 35 years old and still love that stuff
<START> this show is just annoying i feel sorry for the actors for having to attempt to be funny especially bob saget the laugh track tries to cover up the sad jokes and the awwww track comes up at the most unnecessary times the over dramatic kids are no exception especially the olsen twins also this show is clichÃ© city if you were to look up the word clichÃ© it would read full house every story line has a life lesson to be learned at the end a sappy speech makes everything better and even has the ability to make the most bratty child have a sudden realization of goodness gasp too bad this couldn't be possible in real life i don't know how someone could watch this show without bad mouthing the behavior of the characters or the laugh track i find myself yelling at the tv saying that isn't funny sad cute if life were really like this the world would fall apart
<START> absolutely trash i liked halloween and from then on johnny's been in a downward spiral this is about the pits we get it john pro lifers are scary you don't have to make a shitty film that bores the hell out of me to 'tell' me br br the pacing is way off here it feels like john didn't have much to work with here to his credit it looks like he did not write this junk there are countless times where the camera just sits and waits for the actors to look dumb or say something dumb i love the long cut too bad carpenter doesn't know how to employ it he needs to bunk up with herzog and fassbinder 30 years ago please john stop making a fool of yourself and boring me to death
<START> i saw this film and heard the writer director juan gerard speak at the santa barbara int'l film festival br br all i knew about it was that it was the story of an 8 year old boy at the time of the cuban revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family br br its opening scene will bring to mind cinema paradiso in fact the film is filled with references to classic films the roulette wheel casablanca chicken clucking rebel without a cause references to bunuel touch of evil you'll find more the homeless man georg stanford brown is a reference to cuban folklore which often uses a black man as a type of greek chorus br br what this film really is is the culmination of a dream gerard's wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his life br br this is the true story of juan gerard and all the people in it are real as are the events depicted gerard is actually an architect and engineer and passionate film lover but his dream was to make this movie he and his wife decided to live that dream and harvey keitel became an angel who believed in gerard and agreed to produce and star in it keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and secretive grandfather che brown and keitel are the only americans in the cast iben hjejle high fidelity and gael garcia bernal y tu mama tambien offer strong support in key roles br br truthfully the first half of the film suffers from stiff delivery of lines and some overracting but stay with it the last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet and honest climax it is the first effort of juan gerard but it is honest as he is and his passion and heart really come through in this sincere first effort i would definitely see it again and hope that he continues his film career br br
<START> this is the best sci fi that i have seen in my 29 years of watching sci fi i also believe that dark angel will become a cult favorite the action is great but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today
<START> an interesting idea four african american women crushed under society's boot heel take their revenge by robbing banks is ruined by f gary gray's horribly slow direction and an excruciating script by takashi bufford and kate lanier full of unintentionally funny moments instead of delivering a pointed commentary about the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men cruelly abuse and humiliate them gray bufford and lanier prefers to pummel their unsuspecting audience with highbrow notions of operatic tragedy it's melodrama at its worst gray has his actors linger over every tired line and john carter's lazy editing refuses to pick up the slack choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the performers' bemused faces and bemused they are although actors such as jada pinkett kimberly elise and vivica a fox have some raw talent queen latifah is the fourth and as an actress she's an excellent rapper they need a surer hand than gray's to guide them and as a result they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera steer clear
<START> 2054 paris is an escher drawing with people and vehicles scurrying along at multiple levels in an obvious homage to fritz lang's metropolis paris is both ultramodern and crumbling into decay and in the blink between surveillance sweeps a pretty young medical researcher is kidnapped just after leaving her sister in a seedy nightclub a tough police captain investigates shown in stark black and white with the gloomy corridors shadowy alleys and single source lighting characteristic of the most hard boiled of film noir comparisons to sin city are inevitable but the story owes more to masamune shirow and william gibson than to frank miller as high tech surveillance near invisible stealth suits and ruthless super corporations are as much a part of the landscape as guns and cars the film never quite generates the doom laden atmosphere of gibson's cyberpunk vision with its tech heavy marginal characters clashing with industrial types from corporations that all seem to have their own ministry of fear but the viewer definitely gets the sense that future paris is no utopia and future science is less than benevolent and as the police procedural plot line unfolds we are taken into the darker recesses of individual ambition beneath the shiny veneer of avalon corporation's cultivated pr image the motion capture process used here produces a look somewhere between b w comic books and next generation rotoscoping and is either captivating or intrusive depending on your tastes nevertheless a great visual sense is on display here and future paris is filled in down to the tiny details giving the picture a unique look which is in turns both spartan and baroque worth a look
<START> the final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films it goes further to play the anti bond theme bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography stunt work to the script to acting br br the film starts out in a flurry as bourne is running from the moscow police the story seems to pick up right where the first film left off or does it the time is a little muddled here but we get the fact that bourne is remembering things a sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone they aren't his target from there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player noah vosen who seems to know everything about bourne and will protect it at all costs pamela landy is back as well as nicky parsons who seems to have a past with bourne as well br br the cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything the car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two and the veteran cast chasing bourne is superb with a nice part by albert finney it also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot all in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year if not the best action trilogy ever
<START> i must give how she move a near perfect rating because the content is truly great as a previous reviewer commented i have no idea how this film has found itself in imdbs bottom 100 list that's absolutely ridiculous other films particular those that share the dance theme can't hold a candle to this one in terms of its combination of top notch believable acting and amazing dance routines br br from start to finish the underlying story this is not just about winning a competition is very easy to delve into and surprisingly realistic none of the main characters in this are 2 dimensional by any means and by the end of the film it's very easy to feel emotionally invested in them and even if you're not the crying type you might get a little weepy eyed before the credits roll br br i definitely recommend this film to dance lovers and even more so to those who can appreciate a poignant and well acted storyline how she move isn't perfect of course what film is but it's definitely a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a half baked plot and or characters who lack substance the actors and settings in this film make for a very realistic ride that is equally enthralling thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers
<START> omg this was the most painful experience of my life watching this i could even finish it what is happening to nick their best thing on teen nick is drake and josh and thats about to go off air the kids songs are kinda of annoying and the so are the kids my little sister wanted to watch the show because she likes anything that comes on disney or nick usually but after finish watching this show she said one of the worst shows that i have ever saw so boring my little brother actually fell asleep i envy him in short if your 3yrs old with no brain activity you'll enjoy this show otherwise change the channel now
<START> many moons ago when i was seven years old i can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie it appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and i decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie being the wise adults that they are they told me absolutely not it's a bunch of trash of course i was very disappointed that i would not be the first kid on my block to see the incredible melting man br br little time passed maybe a couple of days i forgot about the incredible melting man and my disappointment faded twenty five years passed until it re entered the forefront of my thoughts while surfing through channels on digital cable i found this long lost relic of a movie my curiosity was piqued and i decided to finally partake in this fruit forbidden by my parents i should have listened to them the incredible melting man is perhaps the worst movie known to man it makes movies such as def con 4 metalstorm and freddie got fingered look like oscar nominees i feel violated for wasting almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth the story was incoherent and the effects were crude even for 1977 how anyone convinced a film company to produce this movie beyond me br br don't make the same mistake that i did listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie they were right
<START> the film begins with vincent price about to begin his performance as a magician however mid way through the very successful show the police come and shut him down it seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks price had created even those he made on his own time at home as a result price justifiably kills the evil man the problem is that while the viewer understood why price killed and most probably thought this was a good thing because price was a bit mad he just couldn't stop at one sort of like eating lay's potato chips br br the film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows great plot twists as well as exciting action one thing you can't say about this film is that it is dull while it's also far from subtle it is fun throughout though and well worth a look br br had i never seen vincent price's version of house of wax i probably would have liked the mad magician a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9 that's because while the mad magician is a wonderful film it's highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it house of wax the bottom line is that since house of wax was so successful the formula was re hashed in the follow up film both were made in 3 d both have a plot where price has every justification to kill but he can't stop once he's committed the first and both are great fun to watch the biggest differences and there are few are that house of wax was in color and was more of a horror film and the mad magician was definitely more of a mystery br br my advice is to see this film and house of wax the price version only they are both terrific 1950s horror films
<START> usually i love lesbian movies even when they are not very good i'm biased i guess br br but this one is just the pits yes the scenery and the buildings are beautiful and there is a brief but beautiful erotic interlude but otherwise this movie is just a complete waste of time annamarie alternates between sulking and getting high stoned passing out on whatever drug or booze is handy and ella inexplicably puts up with this abominable behavior through the entire movie at no time are we given any insight into why this is so or even why annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn br br if there had at least been some kind of closure in the potentially romantic we don't even know relationship between the two there might have been some kind of satisfaction but although annamarie at one point asks ella why do you love me ella doesn't even acknowledge this it's never really clear whether this is anything more than an ill behaved lesbian on a boring road trip with a straight woman br br even the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet on the journey which could have been lively and informative are instead flat tedious and mostly incomprehensible br br there is one good joke in the movie although i'm sure it was unintentional the women travel in a two seat ford coupe with a middling sized trunk yet when they set up camp they have an enormous tent cots sleeping gear and even a table chair and typewriter on top of that when they board a ferry we see piles of luggage presumably theirs presumably also carried in the little ford's trunk br br and through the entire film we never see one gas station or anywhere that looks like it would actually have any place to buy gasoline mostly they travel through endless miles of desolate desert so where did they get fuel br br there may not be too many lesbian films out there good or bad but there are plenty that are better than this and very few that are worse leave this one in the rack
<START> i saw this by chance showing on cable on wanted to like it as i thought sandra was quite funny from what i remembered the only facial movement i had throughout the movie was jaw dropping stunned at how awful a movie i just suffered through br br the person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time please point out one line just one scene that is even worth a chuckle br br she is a much better singer than i remember her to be but i didn't want to watch a lounge act br br i think this is a movie try hard to like since they think they should and don't view it objectively
<START> what a good movie at last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock illusions of fame well known rockers are getting old and forgotten not the music and with a good sense of humour have you ever danced on bill haley's rock around the clock br br anyway still crazy is probably the best movie about rock n'roll i have ever seen far much better than spinal tap for instance why because in still crazy people are mature they have a different point of view about rock about love and about life they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much beyond the story itself we see characters with their own personality weaknesses and dreams like anyone of us br br spend a good time watching this listen to the awesome soundtrack and finally thinking of your own future br br bye
<START> after watching a dozen episodes i decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling in the episodes that charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models i thought that my profession was being joked about i am not a mathematician instead a chemical engineer but i do work a lot with mathematical models so i will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to make believe of fairy tales br br first choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task charlie eppes is shown as a genius but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future individuals are erratic and haphazard there is no modeling for them isaac asimov even wrote about that in the 1950's even if there were a model for specific kind of individual it would be a probabilistic stoichastic one meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction br br second supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found the model parameters have to be known these parameters are the constants of the equations such as the gravity acceleration 9 8 m s2 and often are not easy to determine again charlie eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses and after the model and the parameters are chosen they would have to be tested oddly they are not and by miracle they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted br br third a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected not only by numbers but also by sci fi movies the computational effort required for solving these models try to make excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a herculean job even if charlie eppes has the right software to solve his models he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow and even with the right software hardware combination the model solution might well take days to be reached he solves them immediately i could use his computer in my research work i would be very glad br br as a drama it is far from being the best show the characters are somewhat stereotyped but not even remotely funny as those in big bang theory are the crimes are dull and the way charlie eppes solves them sometimes make the fbi look pretty incompetent br br for some layman the show might work for others the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow
<START> while visiting romania with his cia dad tony adam arkin quite a talented high school quarterback seen as the savior to lead his team finally to a victory over rival simpson is told by a would be palm reader in romania the people are not allowed many books so she took up palm reading that he would be bitten by a werewolf when the moon is full don't make any appointments you will be busy well who would have thunk it tony is in fact bitten and his life would be forever changed after his father unfortunately dies in a mishap within his bomb shelter under odd circumstances firing at his werewolf son inside a metallic bomb shelter isn't a very good idea especially if the bullet doesn't leave the room and bounces around like a pinball gone berserk tony travels the land through endless years until he's tired of packing and returns decades and many us presidents later to hopefully lead his football team to a win over simpson a task he abandoned long ago what was once a very white clean cut high school has indeed changed into a ghetto of drug use violence and perversion to get an idea of what the early 80's full moon high school's prom party resembles think studio 54 with teenagers br br larry cohen's parody of werewolf flicks among others things is crammed full of gags homages and in jokes my favorite sequences contain one in the sex ed classroom where tony reveals to the 80's class his werewolf transformation and the introductory scene to dr brand alan arkin who steals the film when kenneth mars isn't on screen quite possibly the worst psychiatrist on earth his task to talk down a jumper leads to two men falling off a balcony the jumper and a fireman trying at first to talk him out of it both fuming mad at brand brand even tries to get tony to sign a waver for his body's being donated to science so he can get his wife a fur coat kenneth mars had me rolling in the floor as a homosexual football coach and later in the 80's as the principal who likes to pat his players on the behind his scene where tony's unloading the truth to the sex ed class is classic the film is loaded with inspired casting choices just littered with funny characters and the cast interpretations such as ed mcmahon as a very conservative military blowhard who actually looks identical to joseph mccathy standing next to his photo in the bomb shelter always talking about commies joanne nail as bulging eyed ricky in present day who falls for the werewolf elizabeth hartman a patch of blue as a mousy nerdy sexually molested and molester teacher who finds an attraction towards tony james dixon as a deputy his great scene has him stealing a line from his police chief reciting it to dr brand who begins mouthing the words to himself for memorization roz kelly as jane an undyingly devoted female desiring tony for only herself constantly demanding he ravish her and bill kirchenbauer as flynn tony's long time pal and now the police chief who only got jane after his friend left town can not forget jm j bullock as flynn's closeted gay son trying to fit in at the school hoping to find a dame with hilarious results br br i like how the film pays homage to the werewolf genre such as when he's on the prowl he's often referred to in the papers as jack the nipper because he likes to bite his victims on the cheek and i'm not talking face he's seen more as an annoyance than danger the homages to carrie and psycho are nice and the violin shtick is also amusing cohen tosses so many zingers at the viewer eventually one has to stick obviously in a comedy such as this not every joke hits it's mark but many do the cast makes this worthwhile the film looks cheap on the typical larry cohen budget notice the 50's scenes where the obvious old cast members that would show up down the road wear glaring wigs loved adam in the lead he is the perfect foil for the gags that follow him and the zingers he lets fly from cohen's script the film moves quickly rarely catching a breath i liked this horror comedy more than most it seems
<START> the kennel murder case starts off at a run and doesn't stop until the very end everybody had reason to kill the victim and several people tried william powell is terrific as philo vance gentleman detective mary astor is refreshing as the put upon niece who only wants to marry her scottish gentleman and enjoy her inheritance this movie comes paired with nancy drew reporter on dvd which is also fun if you have to rent the disc or check it out from your local library do it it's pure entertainment
<START> al pacino kim basinger tea leoni ryan o'neal richard schiff my mouth was watering i dropped everything to watch this movie on cable 30 minutes in i was having trouble staying awake 60 minutes in and i hit the record button and fell asleep finished watching it the next morning shouldn't have bothered what a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a day in the life cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie i guarantee you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep dialogue horrible continuity non existent camera work could have been done with a hand held super 8 and looked better br br this movie was a total disaster
