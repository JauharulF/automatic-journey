<START> dragonlord sees chan returning to his role of dragon from the young master not much has carried over from the first film though tiger his older brother is nowhere to be seen neither is the marshall his daughter or his son played superbly by yuen biao in the original film dragon does have the same master though presumably all the other students have moved on to other things dragon's laziness at training is portrayed heavily in this film so maybe he's still studying br br originally titled young master in love this film sees dragon for the first sixty minutes at least pursuing a villager girl in various idiotic and slapstick ways his rival for her affection is his friend inappropriately named cowboy played comically by the longtime chan stunt team member mars we see various scenes where their silly schemes backfire it is one of these scenes that we thankfully find dragon in over his head br br this film is notorious in that it failed expectations at the box office that said i'm sure the expectations were pretty high and i feel that this film has never had a fair judgment based on it's own merits but even when i try to do this i still feel that there is a problem with the film it seems quite unfocused sometimes rushed and i think the action is too sporadic and not as brilliant as chan's other work from this period br br the thing that really saves the film is the ending sequence as in the young master there is a fantastic final reel that it full of incredibly exhausting action you really feel every blow and again chan goes up against the same rival from the young master is it the same character and the timing and energy here is brilliant chan's style of using every last bit of his environment to help defeat his opponent not just relying on pure physical ability is as apparent here as anywhere else the barn they fight in is full of clever little prop gags and improvisations this is an absolute highlight of the film and one of chan's incredible career br br it's not necessary to see the prequel before seeing dragonlord in fact it might even raise more questions than what it hopes to answer but it must be said that the original film is the superior film and dragonlord with it's focus on girl chasing and team sports does seem baffling luckily the few fight scenes it offers plus a fantastic shuttle cock scene push it over the line as a must see film in this genre
<START> the plainsman is an entertaining western no doubt a classic which is actual even today gary cooper is wild bill hickok ideal for the role together with john wayne and james stewart they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation jean arthur is great as calamity jane nobody that i know played it better than her even if might not be historically accurate the film manages to capture the most important about hickok and about the time it takes place sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that is what demille does here the friendship of hickok with buffalo bill the selling of rifles to the indians by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have because of the end of the civil war custer and little big horn the uneasy relationship between buffalo bill's wife a religious woman with hickok a man who had killed plenty also the unusual love affair between hickok and calamity all this makes 'the plainsman' a non conventional and interesting film anthony quinn has a very short appearance that already shows what a great actor he was going to become a lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time
<START> after their sons are sentenced to life in prison adelle debbie reynolds and helen shirley winters begin receiving threatening phone calls because someone fells their sons got off easy the pair decides to move to california to escape the publicity of the trial and to start a new life they start a dance school that is soon very successful one of the students has a rich unmarried father with whom adelle quickly falls in love in the meantime helen is busy raising rabbits and becoming a little too infatuated with an evangelist on the radio it's only a mater of time before everything falls apart and the women enter a world of madness and murder br br i can't help but compare what's the matter with helen to whoever slew auntie roo also starring shelly winters where that movie seemed almost restrained in its presentation of auntie roo's madness there's nothing holding helen back in this movie it may take a good deal of the movie's running time but once she snaps helen is one bad mad mutha you don't want to mess with her winters is so delightfully demented that it was impossible for me not to enjoy her performance i'm not going to spoil the movie but the things helen is capable of are totally over the top br br as good as winters is reynolds is totally ridiculous in her role as the gold digging tap dancer i got the impression that she thought she was in a movie that would get her nominated for some award this ain't citizen kane quit acting so serious hey debbie don't you realize that you're main purpose is to be a victim of winters' insanity br br i just love these former female stars in the twilight of their career horror movies what's the matter with helen is as fun as any
<START> this early b entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young gene tierney on the ads and posters but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her riding in a hollywoodized camel train previously we've set up george sanders and bruce cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along but must rally in the face of attack i've seen sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn however bruce cabot's allure is pretty much a mystery to me he's base and unsubtle in comparison but i've always felt he'd just emerged smiling from under a car covered in grease and a sixth grade education some people like 'em that way as did gene's gypsy queen character this is an action adventure filler tho and just as we've been warned of invading locals with guns ready to sabotage and attack the brits in their land there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all this feature requires nothing more than your barest attention on a saturday afternoon a programmer that made whatever else it was paired with better it was almost more interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by dorothy dandridge in one of her first roles a two or two and a half stars out of five mdm
<START> anyone interested in pop music and not familiar with british music trends of the late seventies should be sure to watch breaking glass at least once the movie about a young woman's quest to make her mark in the music world captures the times perfectly from the overt sexism rough economic times social upheaval to the shift in pop culture from rough and tumble punk to terribly fey and pretentious futurism new romanticism the music and fashion styles created daily in britain in the late seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled there really has been nothing new since 1980 this was a dazzling time and breaking glass both tells a very personal story and surveys the cultural landscape and does both extremely well
<START> but the general moviegoer's mileage may vary in mary american psycho harron's stylized look at the american sexual psyche as seen through the lens of the immortal queen of curves bettie page br br i'll not bore anyone with a recitation of the iconic status of ms page a prim and proper valedictorian from nashville tennessee who moved to new york in hopes of being an actress and ended up becoming the bondage queen of the universe nor will i run through the sketchy bio pic plot of the notorious bettie page though i offer high kudos to the technical aspects of the film a sequence of animated magazine covers springs instantly to mind improper use of a period camera notwithstanding finally i won't belabor the timely applicability of the film's themes of innocence and perversion freedom and control the sacred and the secular they're there for the viewer to absorb if they wish the more things change the more they stay the same as the saying goes br br what i will ramble on about for a moment is the splendid performance of gretchen mol as bettie page truth is mol's face looks almost nothing like bettie's nor is she particularly built like bettie although only a fool would deny those beautiful breasts and no fool i she doesn't even sport the thick dark bush that concealed ms page's most intimate charms but the fact remains that mol thoroughly embodies the spirit of bettie page in every way shape and form it is a bravura comeback from an undeserved semi obscurity i've never met ms page and sadly never will most likely but i've devoured the photos and videos and read all the bios and interviews available bought the trading cards and other odds and ends and to be honest lusted for ms page ever since i first discovered her in my adolescence between the covers of dusty tease magazines at the barber shop and the five and dime mol perfectly captures the essence of the woman as i have come to conceive her no pun intended in what i consider to be an oscar worthy performance liv tyler could never have matched mol's shining intensity of characterization in a million years and i for one am grateful she left the project not that i'd mind seeing her totally naked i hasten to add but i can't imagine that her brand of sensuality would have translated into the innocent exhuberance of bettie page br br the notorious bettie page is not for everyone any more than bondage and discipline are i suspect it will do much better on disc than in the theaters legions of devoted page fans and the curious will see to that i can only hope that the dvd will be chock full of enough bettie extras to show the uninitiated just how good a job mol has done br br beyond that a tip of the hat to a fine supporting cast especially lili taylor and chris bauer as paula and irving klaw whose celebrity photo business was bettie's doorway to immortality br br a final note to the young scribe who opined that ms page had no effect on his generation take a good look at madonna's cone brassiere and get back to us bettie page is whether you know it or not the true godmother of fetishwear without her madonna and the rest of her kin could never have existed
<START> this movie i've loved since i was young its excellent although it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one can't interpret certain subtleties in the film for example our hero's name is achilles and in the final battle between him and alexander he's shot in the heel with a rocket just as achilles in mythology was shot in his heel that's a just a little fact that is kind of amusing anyway great movie good story it'd be neat to see it redone with today's special effects oddly enough gary graham had average success starring in the t v show alien nation this movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated
<START> when my now college age daughter was in preschool this miniseries appeared on a e from 8 9 each morning my neighbor and i made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of jane eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week good choice br br i'd forgotten how much i loved this movie until i got out my old vhs copy recently timothy dalton is very handsome but still perfect as rochester the dark craggy face the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book although dalton eats a little scenery i couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy william hurt or grumpy ciaran hinds the magic here is that women love dalton and get caught up in the romance br br i would love to know what's become of zelah clarke she is dead on as jane quiet formal saying volumes with but a look the sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth criticism of her performance as wooden is misplaced a servant in a proper english household would have maintained just such a demeanor but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion unlike many other screen janes she appears plain enough to be jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy rochester's attraction to her br br bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact dalton and clarke capture the interplay between jane and rochester with wit and quiet intensity although jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard she refuses to be cowed by the dark blustery rochester the two leads play off each other beautifully br br this is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever
<START> unless you are petrified of russian people or boars this movie is a snorefest actually i fell asleep about 40 minutes in had to fight the urge to just leave the theater i wish i had a waste of a perfectly lovely saturday evening br br even silent hill was scarier heck even pan's labyrinth was scarier i'm still unclear on what was supposed to be scary in this flick br br to begin with i'm very leery of movies that use pidgin russian like this one did in the opening credits it's embarrassing to me since i brought a group of my russian friends we all cringed oh my god br br hmm well luckily for me probably you too this movie has already escaped my brain i just stepped out of it an hour ago so i have no specifics just murky visuals that go nowhere some languishing now dead hope that anything would happen br br perhaps i saw a completely mutilated version of this film because i can't believe it got such great reviews here which is why i saw it ended up being so completely devoid of not only horror or suspense but overall entertainment value as well br br i give it a 2 because yes i fell asleep wanted to leave after 40 minutes but i woke up didn't leave
<START> what a preposterous story murder blackmail child sex allegations gays and the catholic church absolute tripe how is it that most uk based tv dramas sit coms etc have to include the obligortory gay its really getting tiresome now everybody accepts that there are gay people in society just has there are other minority groups but we don't want it ramming down our throats i'll pass on this one in every single show apart from the above the drama went from what could have been an interesting little story into a pantomime the priest was a paedophile and there are gays running about every where oh yes just to be totally pc one of the gay couple was black i am surprised at c ecclestone for even contemplating this when he read the script
<START> get this film if at all possible you will find a really good performance by barbara bach beautiful cinematography of a stately and incredibly clean but creepy old house and an unexpected virtuoso performance by Â the unseen i picked up a used copy of this film because i was interested in seeing more of bach whom i'd just viewed in the spy who loved me i love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little so we start with a nice fresh premise tv reporter bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a california town solvang that celebrates its swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival she brings along a camerawoman who happens to be her sister and another associate the late karen lamm plays bach's sister and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to it is just too funny watching bach mrs ringo starr and lamm mrs dennis wilson going down the street having a sisterly quarrel anyway Â bach's disgruntled beau follows her to solvang as he's not done arguing with her there's a lot of feeling still between them but she doesn't wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down the drain football career the ladies arrive in solvang to do the assignment for their station only to find their reservations were given away to someone else maybe to bach's boyfriend because think of it Â where's he gonna stay the gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum they catch the interest of proprietor mr keller the late sidney lassick who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home insisting his wife will be happy to receive them oh no next thing we know keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife warning her that company's coming and threatening that she'd better play along trouble in paradise the ladies are eager to settle in and get back to solvang to shoot footage and interview swedes but one of the girls doesn't feel good bach and lamm leave her behind wondering to themselves about mrs keller played heartbreakingly by pretty lelia goldoni who looks like she just lost her best pal speaking of which Â under the weather vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub not realizing that keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole she hears him thinks he's come to deliver linen and calls out her thanks lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didn't get a long enough look after he's left poor vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast in a really decent frightening round of action by something big that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor Â the unseen lamm comes home next bach is out finishing an argument with her beau and can't find anyone in the house she knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen and on hands and knees to collect it her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille Â attracting the unseen again well at about the time poor lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen we do a flashback into mr keller's past and get the full story of what his sick sadistic background really is and why his wife doesn't smile much bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are meanwhile lassick has been apprised of the afternoon's carnage by his weeping wife and decides he can't let bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home he tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us br br i cannot say enough for stephen furst whom i'd never seen before it's obvious that he did his homework for this role studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged bach and goldoni each in their diverse way just give the movie luster not only that but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution no stupid cheap tricks eyeball rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners a real treat for your collection
<START> i found this show really late at night and gave it a try it's a refreshing change from the other kinds of things shown late at night if you catch my drift its simplicity of values and sweetness of hearts helps remind me of the way friendships were as children it's something i indulge in whenever i find it on which is rare maybe i should actually check the listings haha and the tension between joe and nick is so cute like any good chick flick you really get emotionally involved in the characters good ol' louisa may alcott still inspiring good stories so apparently i must complete 10 lines of text in order for my opinion to be valid so i guess i'll tell you a bit more the kids are played by talented actors and actresses and the settings are lovely and nature filled another thing you don't see much on television i hope everyone gives it a shot i recognize and am fully aware that it's sappy but it's good heart like i said before it's refreshing
<START> this typical mamet film delivers a quiet evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man joe mantegna good explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist lindsay crouse it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences the cast includes a number of the players found is several of mamet's films steven goldstein jack wallace ricky jay andy potok allen soule william h macy and they do their usual good job i loved lindsay crouse in this film and have often wondered why she didn't become a more noted player than she has become perhaps i'm not looking in the right places br br the movie proceeds at a slow pace with flat dialog yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bang up ending you'd expect a real let down at the ending but i found it uplifting and satisfying i love this movie
<START> my all time favorite movie i have seen many movies but this one beats them all excelent acting wonderful story you will as a normal caring person start to love george altough he is an actor he is also himself and a very lovable person and maby most important thing you will learn to respect look different to people with down syndrome
<START> i usually come on this website prior to going to the movies as i like to see what other people think of the movie i read many reviews which said 'thriller not a horror movie' this prompted me to give this film a try i really must take issue with these 'thriller horror' statements as it was neither i almost went and asked for my money back and if you lot of reviewers enjoyed this rubbish well you must be easily pleased at the end of the movie the people behind me said out loud what a waste of time and i turned to them and replied i couldn't have summed it up better i kept waiting for something to happen but it didn't there was the potential for a lot of good scares or thrills if you like but none happened williams acted the part quite well but i felt he was short changed by a poor script which dithered around and went nowhere save your money folks this is a turkey which will be featuring at a dvd store 'bargain box' near you in the very foreseeable future
<START> even though many people here praises this movie i have to warn you it has no logic whatsoever i think that basinger does a decent job at acting but you can't make a thriller if there is a great lack of realism br br this scene paints a good picture for you of the movie while basinger is pursued by murderous thugs she decides to sit down and gaze upon a picture she finds from her pocket the picture is from her daughter and it reads we love you mommy who does something like that what the eff and believe me when i say that it is not nearly as stupid as some other scenes of the movie someone stated that this is a hidden gem well i have to strongly disagree this movie has stayed hidden for a reason and it's not a gem oh and please i don't even want to start commenting about the red toolbox it hurts my brain d usually the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small amounts but this movie basically is made possible only because of the lack of logic but i still give it a 4 because even though it is embarrassingly flawed in logic it has certain mood that kept me watching till the end br br so if you choose to watch this you know you have been warned
<START> not the best of actors' movies the director has concentrated on projected actor's stardom rather than giving a good entertainer may be hero himself his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it but definitely it's not worth for neutral audience the fight sequences are a total comedy the dance moves in the song sequences are pathetic the music is average this film was the biggest flop for the actor inspite of the hype created over the movie the movie failed miserably don't even think of watching this move even if you want to kill time you can watch some cartoon instead a good movie buff cannot digest this crap for 2 1 2 hours
<START> walking home after the film i was humming the familiar waltz music that natalia and alexandre were dancing to i've heard that before where ah from kubrick's eyes wide shut track 2 'got it just as i arrived at the door it's waltz no 2 from jazz suite no 2 composed by dimitri shostakovich performed here by the city of prague philharmonic orchestra yes i went and picked up the soundtrack from tower's what a treat the film score by alexandre desplat was fulfilling there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz it's not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score reminds me of favorite scores by maurice jarre ennio morricone beginning notes of track 6 have traces of nuovo cinema paradiso georges delerue and john barry there are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings celeste piano and harp br br emily watson and john turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance the love story their intimate connection is very much between alexandre and natalia his childlike yet tormenting inner world and her generous and bold understanding of him a relationship alone to them both director marleen gorris of antonia's line 1996 academy award's best foreign language film from the netherlands gave us a quietly sensitive film not without its unsettling human conflicts intrigues obsessions family strives lovingness and respect the front end subject is the mind game and mathematical logic of chess beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920's cinematography captures the serene beauty of lake como in northern italy near the swiss border br br i highly recommend the soundtrack if you don't feel like going to the movies alexandre desplat's lyrical film score of the luzhin defence is complete
<START> the ladies man is a funny movie there's not much thought behind it but what do you expect from an snl movie it's actually better than most snl movies i e superstar or a night at the roxbury tim meadows and will ferrell were both very funny chris parnell was also funny in his short scene one of the funnier ones in the movie other than that the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support meadows i've definitely seen funnier movies but i've seen dumber ones too again it's not exactly a deep movie but it's good for a few laughs it was funnier as a skit though but still if you're looking for a pretty funny movie i'd recommend this one just don't think about it too much or you'll hate it br br rating 6 10
<START> greg davis and bryan daly take some crazed statements by a terrorists add some commentary by a bunch of uber right reactionaries ascribe the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist moslems on the planet to everyone who calls themselves a moslem and presents this as the theology of islam maybe their next film will involve interviewing fred phelps and the congregation of the westboro baptist church adding commentary by some militant atheist scholars and call their film what the world needs to know about christianity ultimately this film suffers from both poor production values and lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism don't waste your time and money just turn on your am radio and listen to rush limbaugh for a couple of days for free and you'll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis
