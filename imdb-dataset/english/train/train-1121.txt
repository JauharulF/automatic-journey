<START> i really can't say too much more about the plot of the movie that hasn't already been said i haven't seen the movie in about 25 years and the memory of it has never left me i have been searching for it every where i have done net searches for it in the past but came up empty last night i was thinking about the movie again and was trying to remember who was in it but i was only about 10 or 12 when i last saw it and i wasn't even sure if i had the right movie name so i decided to do another search and i finally found this sight i was right if any one knows where i can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family could you please let me now at tawnyteel yahoo com i would really appreciate it and to anyone who has not seen this movie and has the chance to it is well worth it
<START> i was really disappointed with this film the first waters movie i saw was serial mom and i loved it then i saw pecker and i loved it then i watched polyester and really sort of hated it the only thing i liked about that movie was divine she he had a hell of a lot of talent i was truly surprised as a whole i wouldn't recommend this film
<START> girlfight is like your grandmother's cooking same old recipe you've tried a million times before yet somehow transformed into something fresh and new try and explain the story to people who haven't seen it before a young women from the wrong side of the tracks attempts to improve her situation by taking up boxing whilst dealing with a bitter obstructive father and her growing attraction to a male rival watch them roll their eyes at the string of clichÃ©s and they're right it is clichÃ©d yet i was hypnotized by how well this film works due to the frequently superb acting and dialogue and sensitive direction that makes it 'new' i avoided this at the cinema because it looked like complete crap but don't make the same mistake i did definiately worth a look
<START> acidic unremitting and beautiful john schlesinger's masterpiece is no less effective today than 35 years ago when american life was even more disorienting the film probably could not have been made at any other time in history because so many upheavals were taking place in the late 1960s final dissolution of the great american west the intensification of war in vietnam and the clash of social ideals that were bewildering in variety br br 'midnight cowboy' is widely known as the only academy award winning film to garner an 'x' rating but there is much more behind its fame it also exceeds the norm as a work of art while this film from the novel by james leo herlihy has much to say about the erosion of american life it transcends '60s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras the two main characters in fact are standard antiheroes men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our world br br the initial focus of 'midnight cowboy' is on 28 year old joe buck a physically imposing texas native played by jon voight in the opening scenes we follow joe's bus trip to new york city where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents the ability to pleasure women and earn his fortune as a hustler we learn upon his arrival that joe is laughably naÃ¯ve in the sex trade garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as 'one hell of a stud ' the young texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with enrico 'ratso' rizzo dustin hoffman a sickly con man and petty thief from the bronx ratso who is short thin and with a limp proves of little monetary help to joe they quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months joe and ratso shiver in a condemned manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names it is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous odds br br throughout the film joe hearkens back to earlier years in texas including life with his grandmother sally ruth white who served as guardian his harried relationship with 'crazy' annie jennifer salt a notorious local girl and a traumatic event in which joe and annie were assaulted by town folk who wanted to break up the love affair very much of its time 'midnight cowboy' strings together a wild array of flashbacks dream sequences and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also distorting their backgrounds for every moment of understanding we gain from joe and ratso more questions about their lives are generated both men are no doubt in tatters they have no clear sense of direction until ratso falls into the throes of illness and joe finally senses a purpose for being alive this revelation pushes 'midnight cowboy' to its conclusion a rather hopeful one in a very grim story br br while joe and ratso badly need some luck the direction of john schlesinger is clearly outlined and uses the gritty atmosphere of waldo salt's screenplay in allowing voight and hoffman to thrive their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast which features sylvia miles brenda vaccaro and members of the andy warhol clique offers itself as an essential part of the storyline the flashback sequences involving voight ruth white and jennifer salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the heartbreak of time lost br br any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film thanks to the excellent cinematography of adam holender 'the boy who could fly ' 'smoke' and editing by hugh robertson 'shaft' the visuals of 'midnight cowboy' work with its soundtrack assembled by john barry as a cohesive unit sometimes foreseeing music videos of the past two decades the lead song everybody's talking is sung by nilsson which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase the memorable harmonica theme is played by jean 'toots' thielemans br br 'midnight cowboy' has been released in a two disc collector's edition by mgm ua which contains expanded features and commentary also available is a 1998 dvd release used for this review which offers dual widescreen and standard format with 5 1 dolby digital sound enhancement three language subtitles and closed captioning french 'dubbing' a theatrical re release trailer not the 'original' as advertised and an eight page production booklet both dvd editions contain a 25th anniversary restored version of the film showing its original brilliance well deserving of its three oscars best picture schlesinger waldo salt and additional nominations voight hoffman sylvia miles hugh robertson 'midnight cowboy' will be sure to hold its place on the list of immortal classics br br Â½ out of 4
<START> the movie is about anton newcombe the music and careers of the two bands are simply backdrop it's only fair that newcombe have the last word about the film which at this writing you can find in the news section at the brianjonestownmassacre website i'd link it here but imdb won't permit it br br documentarians are limited by what the camera captures as well as by the need to assemble a cohesive narrative from the somewhat random occasions when chance has put the camera lens on a sight line with relevant happenstance in dig fortune smiled on the dandy warhols capturing their rise to the status of pop idol candidates as they formed slickly produced pop confections for mass consumption most notably bohemian like you a song that made them global darlings thanks to a euro cell phone ad br br no such luck for brian jonestown massacre the film captures little of what made the original bjm lineup great with the sole exception of a single montage lasting a minute or so showing newcombe creating recording a number of brief instrumental parts unremarkable in themselves and concluding the sequence with a playback of the lush shimmering sounds that had to have been in newcombe's mind and soul before they could enter the world br br three commentaries accompany the film one by the filmmakers and two by the members of the bands the bjm track is solely former members and without newcombe both the warhols and bjm alumni point up this montage sequence as the best bit in the film and i'd agree that given the film's focus on anton newcombe it is the only part of the film that sheds proper light on his gift and seems too brief to lend proper balance to this attempted portrait of the tortured artist br br interesting thing about commentaries is that unlike film they are recorded in real time one long take which can be more honestly revelatory than a documentary that takes shape primarily through editing br br the dandies do not come off well in their comments if the rock and roll world extends the experience of high school life for its denizens as i believe it does the dandies are the popularity obsessed preppy types the ones who listen to rock because it's what their peers do while the bjm crew come off as the half rejected half self exiled outsiders to insiders like the dandies losers that are the real rock spirit bjm's joel gion who talks a lot nails the film's message for me when he says paraphrasing you can't forget that anton has been able to do the only thing he ever said he wanted to do make a lot of great music br br the dandies meanwhile laugh too easily at every outrageous display in the course of newcombe's meltdown all the bjm footage here ends at 1997 before newcombe quit heroin courtney taylor taylor's discounting of newcombe's commitment to his vision is summed up as follows he's 37 and still living in his car you can download all his work at his website he was so tired of being ripped off by everyone else he's giving it all away he could be making a mint you can practically hear him shaking his head in disbelief br br the film's shortcomings can't be blamed on the filmmakers rather it's the difficulties of the documentary form and the loss of cooperation by the film's subject that makes this portrait of newcombe so fragmentary but it's likely the best we will get outside of his music br br i only rented disc one which has the feature most of the extras are on disc two not renting that as i've put in my order to buy the set
<START> don't listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitter gamers still sore from the roasting silverman infamously gave them at spike tv video game awards a couple of months ago the sarah silverman is wonderfully bizarre surreal immature ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a adult swim line up if silverman tones down the juvenile doody jokes and emphasizes the darker meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled strangers with candy but just from watching the pilot its just solid not outstanding offbeat dark comedy musical but with huge potential br br silverman has created a hilarious child woman of a character a prettier younger jewish american princess version of the late great jerri blank and the show features one of the most unconventional non stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple i have ever seen on television early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so i can't wait to see how this show unfolds
<START> cement is a bad movie about a bad cop penn with a bad attitude and a bad disposition who has a bad guy in a bad way up to his cajones in fast drying concrete while we're waiting for the cement to dry and the film to figure out what it's about we're periodically jerked back in time without rhyme or reason so we can watch events leading up to the cement thing a boring junk flick overall cement suffers from lack of a story a clumsy execution and that most ubiquitous of filmdom's faults no reason to care a time killer for the needy couch potato at best d
<START> i really wish that when making a comedy the people actually tried to make it funny this is a film that you can sit through but nothing is special about it after watching it you will say that it was alright it was not boring to watch but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o k story this movie wanted to be tootsie but instead it failed br br i gave it a 1 out of 10
<START> even 15 years after the end of the vietnam war jacknife came not too late or was even superfluous it's one of the few that try to deal with the second sad side of the war the time after different from movies like taxi driver or rambo which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after war environment this movie allows the audience to face a different view on the vietnam vets their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war the problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship jacknife might be the quietest vietnam movie ever but after almost 15 years this is really plausible and therefor justified moreover it can make us believe that the war has not finished yet at least for some of us br br the three main characters are amazing de niro has done one of his best jobs but ed harris is the star of this movie possibly this was his best performance ever
<START> just when it was easy to assume that a costume drama about royalty couldn't go anywhere we are given a treat a moving and intelligent drama anchored by strong and charismatic performances by emily blunt a marvel in the leading role paul bettany rupert friend miranda richardson and mark strong as the immediate forces that help shape the development of one of england's most powerful monarchs the young victoria dramatizes the tumultuous transition of the young woman into power br br emily plays the queen with a good combination of raw strength and innocence someone who recognizes the complexity of the task at hand but who possesses enough confidence to move forward she is able to portray victoria as an astute young woman who knows she needs support from some key players and must be able to stand up to those who might now have her best interests at hand br br victoria must fend a barrage of intrusions on her way to the crown and even when she takes command of her new position she discovers the road to self sufficiency will depend on making some very important decisions and of course the right support luckily for victoria there is albert a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate there is amazing chemistry between the two performers and there's little doubt what the outcome will be but there is the figure of bettany's prime minister a man who provides victoria with some wise support and is also fond of her br br miranda richardson and mark strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and exert a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl every one of the supporting characters could use a bit more of development but what we can see in the screen might be enough to keep us focused on the central character and a superb performance by blunt an actress who has shown enough fire and passion in previous performances in here she is given the breakout role of her career a real life historical figure who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time she shows the seeds of the strength and character the monarch might have needed in her later years she also has a sweetness and innocence that became the foundation of her charitable work and future intervention in social changes br br the young victoria is not a royal epic portrayal of england's ruling class it is an intimate story of how human beings grow up and whatever special circumstances surround and shape them in the end the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction in here there is a message that good writing and good mediation can take us very far and there is of course a good old fashioned love story
<START> the movie i thought was excellent it was suppose to be about romance with a little suspense in between br br rob stewart is a wonderful actor i don't know why people keep giving him a bad rap as for mel harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for rob it's only by five years br br rob had a lead role in his own tv series as well as one on the scifi channel i'm sure you remember topical heat aka sweating bullets and painkiller jane br br he also starred in a number of tv movies and is now making a tv mini series br br they need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at
<START> neatly sandwiched between the stranger a small film noir picture that proved welles can do a formidable genre work on budget and on time and ironically proved his biggest box office success in the forties and macbeth a no budget shakespeare adaptation shot in old western shets in 23 days comes the lady from shangai a dark film noir woven from the very same fabric of wellesian mythos that covers the magnificent ambersons mr arkadin and any other film the director didn't manage to save from the clutches of studio bosses br br six years after the maltese falcon with the post war craze of the film noir in full swing welles always ahead of his time a true visionary director of tremendous artistic integrity envisioned a labyrinthine world of shadows that is already darker more sinister paranoid and serpentine than anything his contemporaries were doing at the time it's no wonder the movie was so misunderstood at its time to the point that one full hour of footage was forever left in the cutting room floor and it was once again europe that championed it as another welles classic br br certain set pieces stand out the aquarium scene with its flickering light and ominous shadows and of course the funhouse hall of mirrors finale that is as classic a piece of wellesian bravura as any in citizen kane or the trial the only faults i find with the movie is welles' ill advised irish accent and perhaps some of the erratic editing in the first act the story however unfurls in a progressively mesmerizing manner which the cuts only serve to intensify i believe the heavily chopped versions of shangai and ambersons attain a surreal quality for that matter br br welles would exile himself in europe for ten years and return in 1958 to deliver yet another stonewall classic the monumental touch of evil perhaps the crowning jewel of the film noir that was already in its waning days by that time shangai was not the box office success a star vehicle for hollywood's premiere star of the time rita hayworth ought to have been and welles marriage with hayworth ended before the movie was even released sixty years later and one hour of footage less shangai is still one of the best film noir pictures one is likely to discover surely that must count for something
<START> although i'm grateful this obscure gem of 70's italian exploitation cinema features in the recently released grindhouse experience box set and although it's also available on disc under the misleading and stupid alternate title escape from death row i honestly think it deserves a proper and luxurious dvd edition completely in its originally spoken languages with subtitle options the dubbing is truly horrible restored picture quality and a truckload of special bonus features heck i don't even need the restored picture quality and bonus features if only we could watch the film in its original language mean frank and crazy tony is a cheerfully fast paced mafia crime flick with a lot of violence comedy which admittedly doesn't always work feminine beauty and two witty main characters tony lo bianco is terrific as the small thug pretending to be the city's biggest don when the real crime lord frankie dio lee van cleef arrives in town he sees an opportunity to climb up the ladder by offering his services frankie initially ignores the little crook but they do eventually form an unlikely team when frankie's entire criminal empire turns against him and a new french criminal mastermind even assassinates frankie's innocent brother tony helps frankie to escape from prison and together they head for marseille to extract frankie's revenge the script of this sadly neglected crime gem funnily alters gritty action suspense with light headed bits of comedy like the grotesque car chase through the narrow french mountain roads for example the build up towards the typical mafia execution sequences guided by an excellent riz ortolani score are extremely tense and the actual killings are sadistic and merciless which is probably why the film is considered to be somewhat of a grindhouse classic the film lacks a strong female lead as the lovely and amazingly voluptuous beauty edwige fenech sadly just appears in a couple of scenes and then still in the background on of the men behind the camera responsible for the superb cinematography was no less then joe d'amato great film highly recommended to fans of italian exploitation and i hope to watch it again soon in its original version
<START> br br in 1970 after a five year absence kurosawa made what would be his first film in color dodes' ka den is a film that centers around many intertwining stories that go on in a small tokyo slum br br the title comes from the sound a mentally retarded boy makes as he imagines he is operating a train we slowly get to know more of the people in the small community the two drunks who trade wives because they are not happy with the ones they have the old man who is the center of the town who helps out a burglar that tries to rob him the very poor father and son that cannot ever afford a house so they imagine one up of their own by the end of the film the stories all come full circle some turn out happy others sad br br since this was kurosawa's first color film you can see that he uses it to his advantage and it shows maybe too much this movie goes in many different directions and it's hard to settle down and get into it but don't get me wrong dodes' ka den may not be kurosawa's best but coming from the greatest director of all time it's much better than 99 of today's films
<START> i got mirror mirror mainly because yvonne de carlo was in it i thought she was great in american gothic but sadly she didn't have a very big role in this film it starts off ok and the pace moves along nicely but by the end it starts getting a bit tedious and dull that's not to say that this is a boring film but it's just very average and nothing spectacular i didn't like the posession side of it and there were no decent gore scenes plus the 'main' story was very confusing and the ending doesn't make much sense at all i did however like the story surrounding the gothic girl and how she got revenge on her tormentors br br i wouldn't particularly recommend mirror mirror to horror fans it's nothing to wet yourself over
<START> jazz aficionados will treasure this classic short showing some of the best men of jazz just doing their thing it's like watching a no frills music video today br br the jazz men give us an additional treat in the person of marie bryant who sings a classic version of on the sunny side of the street i had never heard her sing before bryant sounds remarkably like billie holliday that's a compliment folks br br their instrumental work is tops as well with the black cinema of its time fed a lot of white stereotypes this film is to be watched and treasured no great production values just a lot of good music
<START> they screwed up this story in the end nell is all heroic and taking on for the team to save all their asses from hill house and a bunch of nonsense like that they added heads getting chopped wires cutting peoples faces and the ceiling turning into a giant hand what the hell is that about i own and love the original movie i read the book and i love it the reason why the original movie and the book are so great is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost there is no gore there is no ceiling hand it is only the ghost ad how ghosts can truly kill a person they cannot kill us they cannot throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head no they can only drive us mad taking away all our senses of security nell was a selfish woman she only wanted good things for herself yes she cared a little for the others but not too much david self and jan de bont have taken a crap on this great story i hate this damn remake
<START> i first saw this mini series a number of years ago on british television and was immediately captivated by the story this rather surprised me as i am not a great fan of either 'jane eyre' or 'wuthering heights' i consider the heroine of the former to be a self righteous bore and the latter piece of work as overblown claptrap br br 'the tenant of wildfell hall' like the aforementioned works is also somewhat depressing in parts however the darker parts of the film were offset by the excitement of helen's escape the breathtakingly wild and beautiful landscape of yorkshire and the sexual magnetism of toby stephens br br this film successfully portrays the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle of all women of the time at best they suffered from a form of minor domestic tyranny as portrayed by the treatment of the womenfolk in the markham household at the other end of the scale there is the unfortunate helen who is married to a wealthy man of high estate but is exposed to brutality and humiliation alternating with long periods of neglect she runs away and experiences a brief moment of freedom but as a women of mystery living alone in a rural community she inevitably becomes the subject of spiteful gossip and speculation br br tara fitzgerald is excellent as the long suffering helen markham not only incredibly beautiful in spite of that terribly unflattering hairstyle with the most amazing cheekbones she is also more than capable of playing the central role in the film tara is dignified and aloof while at the same time allowing us to see that helen is still dangerously vulnerable rupert graves is the depraved yet curiously attractive arthur huntingdon after seeing him i could never imagine another actor playing that part pam ferris deserves special mention for her role as gilbert's indulgent mother as does the actress who played his sister rose and simon carter who is the uncharitable vicar with a taste for the good things in life finally i could watch this film for toby stephens alone he is so good looking rugged sexy sensitive but not in a nauseatingly sentimental way i am not even sure if he is a good actor as my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively br br if there is a fault with the film it is the use of flashbacks which i felt both interfered with the flow of the story and made it slightly confusing other people who have watched this film with me also had problems with this and i found i had to explain to them that certain scenes were in fact retrospective br br i am extremely grateful for the people responsible for making this film not only did i puchase the video a rare occurrence but it led me to buy anne bronte's superb novel naturally this was better than the film but only by a narrow margin i recommend that anyone interested should watch the film and then read the book in that order br br
<START> those who love elivra as i did in her late night movie hostess duties will love this movie she is just plain cool her car is great and she is a bit of a transylvanian dolly parton she is so innocent and naive at times and sexy all of the time plus more than a touch of mae west br br the sets are well done as well and the comic cast is great with edie mcclurg at her usual best plus sally kellerman as patty is hilarious any time i have to crunch something for a topping i will think of how elvira crunches the potato chips br br this movie is one to be watched again and again just for the fun of it now i have to get the sequel to it elvira's haunted hills and see if it lives up to this one
<START> when i think of return of the jedi i think epic yeah ewoks were in there so what they're an interesting add to the movie not to mention they are similar to the vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies emperor palpatine portrayed by the amazing theater actor ian mcdiarmid was one the best parts of the movie palpatine is so evil and vicious vader looks like mr rogers compared to him speaking of darth vader what an amazing end to such an iconic character vader is truly a modern day greek tragedy and i think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after revenge of the sith came out his redemption at the end was moving and really brings a happy yet bittersweet feeling to you the best part was of course the special effects it's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with it's graphics the scenes at jabba's palace leia looks amazing in that metal bikini and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at in all jedi's deep plot and emotional moments primarily between luke vader and palpatine and when luke reveals the truth to leia and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history
