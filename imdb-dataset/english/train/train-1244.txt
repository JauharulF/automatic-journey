<START> this film is unusual and bizarre and it is nearly unusual and bizarre in a very good way i give this short a 7 just because it is so unique and off the wall but much of the time it seems as though it is being bizarre just for the sake of being bizarre if the film had managed to integrate its more bizarre moments into some semblance of a plot then it would have been really fantastic br br the main problem here is that it looks as though the creators just jumbled together a bunch of crap about spatulas then threw in a whole bunch more crap that sounded as though it would sound funny coming from the mouth of a spatula br br this is definitely worth checking out but it is not top rate by any stretch of the creators wild imaginations
<START> well not actually this movie is very entertaining though went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the i think there might be something in my eye routine the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides in fact all the characters are great the movie is not overly funny or sappy good flick to go see with the wife br br all in all 8 10 note i am not an easy grader thats all from bigv over and out
<START> let's start by the simple lines from the viewer's side there a couple of good director details some points of view at the movie scenes that are nice the special effects are good enough a good acting good scenery also but the story is way too simple it shows how a elite army bomb squad unit lives acts and sometimes dies it shows the drama of living in war in my movie experience as a serious action movie addicted guy i missed that click that gets my eyes and mind stuck on the screen one of the things that need to be present in a movie in order to i consider it a good one is the ability of immerse the viewer in the movie reality and time it didn't happened to me i stayed conscious for the entire movie br br honestly speaking i think that this movie gained its place in fame based on the subconscious appeal of american patriotism a healthy and genuine feeling but not the adequate use as a movie fame generator more than a movie about war it grows its popularity based on that br br a simple thought if this was a world war ii or i movie only changing time with everything remained the same would it be this awarded sure not why because there are great ones that elevate the bar way to high br br compared against its rivals in the oscars i don't think that all of the prizes it won are correctly awarded
<START> fact stargate sg 1 is a cheesy sci fi tv series br br there's no escaping facts how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg 1 remains a cheesy sci fi tv series br br stargate sg 1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly special fx aren't nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn't going to blow you out of the chair or couch for that matter either br br but and this is where i really think stargate sg 1 deserves all the credit it can get for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci fi movie that's actually worse than a one hour tv episode br br in fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies br br and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg 1 special br br i am very picky with my selections i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught br br so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg 1 as yet another tacky sci fi show don't stick with it and you'll see what i'm talking about
<START> it took us a couple of episodes to get into dark angel as a story and a series since we were transitioning from the sopranos a very different mentality framework but once we got with the gist of the series we were very quickly hooked it's a shame that the series ended just when it was just starting to past good into the excellent category dark angelwas much more than your average tv series it kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to mutants reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face and make everyday that the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the anti discrimination message from being rubbed in our faces hence not ruining the fun for those who don't like to be lectured during entertainment but every event and human societal interaction remains relevant to the present we all make judgments face our own prejudices but in the end the question of who you are lies in do you sit back and shut your mind to it or do you get up and do something about it for those who have no choice but to fight for survival or justice this series empowers them for those who've never had to face the question this series sneaks in that message under the guise of pure action entertainment it is much more well made and well written than most tv series i'm highly disappointed it ended before it could really kick into high gear
<START> i saw this film under the title of tied up in general i have enjoyed dolph's movies so gave this one a try it wasn't worth it i have read some of the previous comments about the box enticing viewers don't be fooled this is a poor film at best the acting is nonexistent the plot what little there is of one is very predictable the movie in places seems to be chopped together this one just plain stinks the place up not even worth the price of a cheap night rental as a bit of a dolph fan i kept waiting to see him in action by the end of the movie you will still be waiting best to avoid this film and spend your time watching almost anything else
<START> pierce brosnan has sipped his last martini and returns in an outrageous self parody as the aging foul mouthed boozy assassin julian noble who has a particular fondness for teenage girls bullfights and tacky clothes during a job in mexico city he meets danny greg kinnear a straight faced denver suburban business man who's in town to make his deal of a life time in a hotel bar despite their completely different personalities and julian's crude and insensible remarks they become friends br br largely carried by the performances of pierce brosnan and greg kinnear director richard shepard revealed that he didn't write the film with pierce brosnan in mind but i can hardly imagine this without him he proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just james bond or cold war spies the scene in which the two meet at a glossy hotel bar stunning sets and beautifully photographed really is a bravura piece of acting skills the scene lasts almost fifteen minutes and although it was probably carefully scripted the two actors are largely improvising but they succeed wonderfully it almost feels like a new standard in screen acting think of robert de niro and harvey keitel in mean steets improvising and add one of the most subtle underpinnings of many genre clichÃ©s and the actors' own typecasting brosnan's james bond in particular and you got one of the most delightful pairings in recent hollywood br br sadly the story wears thin after a while after an hour the film just runs out of steam nevertheless and i can't put my finger on it exactly i did enjoy this very much it just feels very fresh and original with some imaginative use of sets and lighting and some hints to seijun suzuki and jean pierre melville the other characters aren't given much to do but this film does offer something new in that respect it almost effortlessly succeeds in blending all conventional genres into quite an entertaining spoof very amusing br br camera obscura 7 10
<START> i was so surprised when i saw this film so much underrated i understand why some of you dislike this movie its pace is slow a characteristic of japanese films nevertheless if you are absorbed in the film like me you will find this not a problem at all br br i must say this is the best comedy i have ever seen shall we dansu is often considered a masterpiece of japanese comedies it is very different from hollywood ones e g austin powers or scary movies in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes rather it is light hearted a movie that makes you feel good br br i love the movie because it makes me feel real the plot is straightforward yet pleasing i was so delighted seeing that sugiyama the main role has found the meaning of life in dancing before i watched the film i was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork i felt lost however this film made me think of the bright side of life i believed i was in the same boat of sugiyama if he could find himself in his hobby why couldn't i it reminded me of exploring my own future and discovering the happiness in my daily life br br it is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers while some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect i kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really alive learning to dance as the film goes on br br over all this film is encouraging and heart warming as a comedy it does its job perfectly it definitely deserves 10 stars br br and yes aoki is funny d
<START> what a night perry mason then have gun will travel followed by gunsmoke when it was a half hour and finally at 10 30pm came 'sea hunt' with its wonderful opening theme music and mike's boat sailing off to a new adventure terrific regardless of the story it was the lead character played by lloyd bridges strong honest sincere a man's man and a boy's man this brought on an interest in boats that lasted for years why they don't show on cable or make it available on video no idea too bad
<START> i miss dark angel br br i understand not ever one likes it but as far as i'm concerned the show should not have been canceled especially for another space show mock up br br i'm reading the books now they are doing a pretty good job of explaining somethings but i still think we should get a tv movie or something br br the freak nation lives
<START> i loved it so much that i bought the dvd and the novel at the same time the chemistry between the actors including little arthur is amazing and thrilling br br it could have used a bit more screen time for the yummy frederick lawrence played by james purefoy and gilbert markham was amazingly on it from the very start of the movie br br the one who most thrilled me via surprising shock and awe and wonder was rupert graves as arthur huntingdon i adore him in forsyte saga and all else i've seen him in but he outdoes himself here as arthur in my wildest dreams i could not have pictured him playing a demented psycho such as arthur huntingdon but he does and i love it and i love him
<START> i'm glad that users as of this date who liked this movie are now coming forward i don't understand the people who didn't like this movie it seems like they were expecting a serious treatment c'mon how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously the filmmakers knew this was a silly premise and they didn't try to deny it the straight faced delivery of scenes actually makes it funny yes there are times where the low budget shows such as that explosion scene but i think an expensive look would have taken away from the fun of the movie so if you like b movies and the goofy premise appeals to you then you'll certainly like jack frost
<START> german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he's unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made br br lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best worst of ew i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set the answer is subterranean lommel dug a pit and buried it br br the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies only someone who has lived in los angeles where every auto mechanic doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face br br the main character a villainous beat cop is played by a german actor with a thick german accent aside from being a serial killer he is also the oldest beat cop in la despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners the lapd refuses to investigate going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment br br the sets are excruciatingly bad the production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint enough to paint precinct 707 on a cardboard wall br br since the actors were obviously unpaid non professionals a sad assortment of european emigres possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands bimbos mimbos and desperate middle aged women and since little if any money was spent on sets special efx locations or other production value it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine looking police uniforms sadly they couldn't afford a police car the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental br br more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies the other fits right in with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated br br the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her don't ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered just accept lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride br br after much prolonged hand clawing out of straw covered roadside graves the zombie girls manage to make their appearance they look exactly as they did before death maybe even prettier with black glamor make up generously airbrushed around their eyes looking nothing like zombies they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway br br at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll and injects large doses of cheesy euro trash techno into the soundtrack we're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty br br unlike other zombies lommel's girls speak and function as normal er i mean as they did before becoming zombified this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog yes a golden shower it is br br i won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending all i can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece the spirit of ed wood lives on or should i say his geist
<START> this happy go luck 1939 military swashbuckler based rather loosely on rudyard kipling's memorable poem as well as his novel soldiers three qualifies as first rate entertainment about the british imperial army in india in the 1880s cary grant delivers more knock about blows with his knuckled up fists than he did in all of his movies put together set in faraway india this six fisted yarn dwells on the exploits of three rugged british sergeants and their native water bearer gunga din sam jaffe who contend with a bloodthirsty cult of murderous indians called the thuggee sergeant archibald cutter cary grant of the last outpost sergeant macchesney oscar winner victor mclaglen of the informer and sergeant ballantine douglas fairbanks jr of the dawn patrol are a competitive trio of hard drinking hard brawling and fun loving alpha males whose years of frolic are about to become history because ballantine plans to marry emmy stebbins joan fontaine and enter the tea business naturally cutter and macchesney drum up assorted schemes to derail ballentine's plans when their superiors order them back into action with sgt bertie higginbotham robert coote of the sheik steps out cutter and macchesney drug higginbotham so that he cannot accompany them and ballantine has to replace him half of the fun here is watching the principals trying to outwit each other without hating themselves director george stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in grand style and scope as our heroes tangle with an army of thuggees lenser joseph h august received an oscar nomination for his outstanding black white cinematography
<START> with the death of george nader on 4 february 2002 i thought of this most interesting program which even though it had only a short run was a tremendous idea with good story lines throughout generally unseen for over 40 years it would be worth viewing again the opening credits showed many differing images one of which was a snippit of colonel john paul stapp riding his famed rocket sled at the point where he was often referred to as the fastest man alive
<START> excellent plot within a plot within a plot shame about two of my film heroes having a good snog must be my upbringing br br very well acted by all you never quite know who's going to out do who the last little twist at the end allows for all to get their just deserts br br recommend to all a harmless tongue in cheek thriller which if it has any faults is probably michael caine's over use of the word bloody but that's his signature isn't it br br 9 10
<START> come on they did that on purpose two of my current faves on tv meloni from oz and l and o svu and janel from west wing hook up for a nice little sleeper character study plot's nothing fancy but the acting is right on the mark tim busfield shows up for some neat bits worth a look
<START> there is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst i have seen in some time as f scott fitzgerald gregory peck and sheilah graham deborah kerr are lounging on the beach suddenly things become tense and sheilah begins to cry at which point she tells her lover about her sordid past this dramatic scene becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic i couldn't help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all was as dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo no one experiences moments like this no one now how much of the rest of the film is true i cannot say but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an 8 rolex and leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correct the film is a lot of bunk however i am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet didn't seem to clear this up either br br just who were f scott fitzgerald and sheilah graham and what was their relationship really like what i do know about fitzgerald however does seem different from what i saw in the film was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film well considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with graham and drank like a fish i'd assume he wasn't was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film perhaps but if he was this bad and yet ms graham stayed with him then this makes her out to be a complete dummy and not someone you'd like to see featured in a film and if he wasn't then the film does a poor disservice to his memory either way it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience br br the sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people in a dark and salacious way some might find this all very entertaining but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way unpleasant but with glossy production values especially the music which was lovely but way over the top it begs the question why did they even choose to make this in the first place the bottom line it's a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your time even if like me you are big gregory peck fan
<START> i originally gave this episode a rating of two i now wish i'd thought more about it i also wish they had negative rating options br br watching it i was amazed at how poor the whole thing was from start to finish i adore ron pearlman and john carpenter so what went wrong last season episode 13 was pulled due to the way it handled the abortion issue i think that this season mr carpenter managed to make something so grey area that you can't immediately see if he is pro choice or anti abortion it was only after i sat and thought about it that i realized he is very much anti abortion you get this most clearly in the end when the 'mother' shoots the baby and kills it to the dismay of the 'father' who walks off in grief leaving the mother unharmed but you also see it in the way the ron p character is treated i hardly think that if someone has proved themselves enough of a threat in the past so as to have a restraining order against him that they would not immediately be ringing the police instead we have the guard almost sympathetically dealing with him only to pay for it in the end i don't mind someone having a strong view on something even if it isn't something i agree in but i do think its a bit lame not to stand by that view rather than trying to look like they're sitting somewhere in the middle br br but political issues aside this episode was beyond poor the music was retro 70's and just plain didn't work the acting other than ron p was poor the effects were dreadful it might have been better just to not show the monster at all rather than show the lame excuse for a monster they had br br all this being said i'm glad they have the masters of horror i don't mind sitting through some really poor episodes to find the good ones its a bit like renting horror movies from the video store every now and again you get a good one and it makes it all worth while i do agree with the poster that said maybe the name needs to change from masters some of these people just plain don't deserve the title let me stress tho even tho i hated this episode john carpenter totally deserves the title he is a master thru and thru
<START> to begin with i loved gÃ¶ta kanal 1 it had a lot of classic jokes including that unlucky guy in the canoe who always seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time he is still acting the same guy in the gÃ¶ta kanal 2 movie but in my opinion hes performance is not as funny as it was in the first movie in fact you don't notice him much at all a thing that made me think bad about this movie is the choice of boats in this movie there are only race boats they sure is speedy but those do not make waves like the big floating mansions used in the first movie i liked the old ones better and these new boats makes one of the last scenes look ridiculous when the man in the canoe suddenly jumps out of it to evade the big waves from those small speedy boats truly a minus you have to accept that we're not living in the same sweden as in 1974 anymore this movie also contains a bit more violence than the first one although the movie was great all in all i've just concentrated on some cons that i was disappointed in but the rest of the movie were up to my expectations so go see it it's worth the money
