<START> i remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid and there were parts of it many in fact that i did not understand i think i have seen it once as an adult and i then understood those parts the only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all so what kind of movie is this is it a kids movie not hardly it contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children maybe but then why wouldn't it focus more on john ritter's character instead of junior when a film has a 7 year old as its main character in order to do well with it's audience it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate even 8 year olds wouldn't want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them i'm pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market
<START> do not bother to waste your money on this movie do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you if you must see a movie this weekend go see batman again br br the script was horrible perfectly written from the random horror movie format given a place in confined spaces a madman with various weapons a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together and an innocent and overly curious yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend mix together add much poorly executed gore and what the hell let's put some freaks in there for a little spin to the plot br br the acting was horrible and the characters unbelievable borat was more believable than this br br spoiler and can someone please tell me how a butcher's vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch i'm in the army we need that kind of stuff for ourselves br br 1 out of 10 and i would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score i can
<START> ok it's not a perfect movie by any means but i disagree with the overall imdb opinion that it's really really bad i watched a lot of hong kong flix in the 1990's and loved the era dearly i never saw 'black mask' at the time and only saw it last week for the first time apart from the embarrassingly poor dubbing which my dvd copy didn't give me the option to turn off the movie contains the raw energy and bravado that permeated hong kong movies during this time i still stick to my guns in the opinion that when it comes to action these guys no matter what their budget add an element of magic to the screen no bourne supremacy casino royale or mission impossible i'm not knocking these movies i just reckon they lack the spontaneity of this one and feel too regulated will ever achieve what is it it's the feeling that the film makers were experimenting as they shot and edited not afraid to leave in some blemishes so as to learn lessons for the next time for me this makes watching movies all the more fun and dangerous
<START> this is an amazing film to watch or show young people aside from a very brief nude scene it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in africa that you'll rarely find in other films it does bear a superficial similarity to out of africa but without all the romantic fluff the white french people in cameroon are fascinating because they don't even seem to regard the natives as people the whites are all the bosses and they expect black servitude without question however unlike real servants you only once hear any of the whites say 'thank you' and no other regard is given these people again and again it's like they are pets or slaves as the feelings of the people are never even considered br br the central illustration of this thoughtlessness is the relationship between the mother aimÃ©e and her servant protÃ©e although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other the white woman never considers protÃ©e or the existence of his feelings a good example of this thoughtlessness is when she has protÃ©e lace up her dress and it's obvious that he is very sexually frustrated by this apart from this relationship while almost all the whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the africans are people a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat them like garbage br br also interesting is the relationship between protÃ©e and the little girl who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the film while they are very close at times he's more like a plaything or pet and the girl never plays with native children br br there is one bizarre white character who seems at times to regard the blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing one moment he's doing hard work along side the blacks or eating with them something the other whites would never have done and the next he's trying to beat up protÃ©e i could only guess as to what motivated him perhaps he was just a jerk or was crazy or perhaps was a communist agitator trying to stir up the blacks against the whites who knows in fact other than a few good scenes this character seems pretty much wasted br br while i really enjoyed the insight this movie gave i wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small period of her life the context and what happened to rid the country of colonialism is never addressed and the film left me wanting more the film appeared to begin in the early 1980s since she's wearing a walkman style headset and when the film went back in time it seems that it was set about 1960 more or less but there was never any mention of the 1950s anti colonialism violence or independence for the nation in the early 1960s i am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the film screwed up and should have made the beginning of the film earlier such as the 1970s and had the lady think back to her life there in the early 1950s before the country experienced political change br br apart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods using the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult traveling the country was a good idea and i also appreciated the ending as it was a pleasant surprise when you find out more about the nice man who offers her a ride but overall it just feels like something is missing there just isn't any sort of resolution or message other than showing that colonialism is thoughtless and cruel
<START> pretty incoherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s superficially hippie religious cult who fights them sixteen years later the man has a child with one of the other cultists who during a raid by the police is hidden away and taken by another man named hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river the cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town it's hard to keep track of who characters are or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place the leader gets paroled sixteen years later i got that from the box i missed the amount of time in the movie nobody is made to look any older not noticeably anyway br br one murder is done with a large circular logging saw others are done with knives or a crossbow i never heard the title character's name mentioned in the movie but he's the one who overacts the most hooting and hollering br br the movie is patched together pretty poorly with voice over helping not much to explain what is going on some of the sound effects were pretty bad a man is getting punched and we hear the sound of a whip cracking a woman fires a gun and we don't hear it fire but hear a ricochet instead it doesn't seem to have been done for comical effect
<START> a year after losing gorgeous jane parker maureen o'sullivan to love rival tarzan hunter harry holt neil hamilton returns to the jungle to have another bash at winning the brunette babe's heart mixing business with pleasure he also plans to grab himself some ivory from the elephant graveyard that lies beyond the mutia escarpment tarzan's stomping ground br br accompanied by his slimy womanising pal martin arlington and a group of expendable bearers harry finally arrives at his destination having narrowly avoided death at the hands of savage natives and rock hurling apes only to find that jane is still infatuated with her musclebound yodeller and worse still that tarzan is refusing to let the hunters take any ivory from the graveyard br br nasty arlington decides to resolve matters by ambushing and shooting the ape man and then telling jane and holt that tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile of course tarzan isn't deadÂonly wounded after being nursed back to health by cheetah he swings back into action just in time to rescue jane from a tribe of vicious lion eating savages who have attacked holt's expedition br br tarzan and his mate the second movie to star weismuller as the jungle man of few words is often cited by fans as the best of the series although i slightly prefer the original i can definitely understand the film's popularity it's damn sexy and there are some great action sequences the undeniable chemistry between weismuller and o'sullivan is fabulous and leads to some pretty steamy scenes and with both stars wearing eensy weensy outfits throughout there's eye candy aplenty for viewers of both sexes to enjoy despite o'sullivan's much touted underwater nude scene actually being performed by a body double the lovely lass still shows plenty of skin even threatening to do a 'sharon stone' at one point as her loin cloth flaps to one side br br the film's most exciting moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between tarzan and a crocodile and the spectacular finalÃ© where jane is attacked by lions and natives but is rescued by her beau his monkey pals and a load of elephants in full on lion crushing mode once again the violence is surprisingly nasty at times although as far as i am concerned there is nothing quite as shocking as the vicious pygmies and their gorilla pit from the first film cheetah also has his fair share of excitement dodging rhinos crocs and big cats riding on tarzan's back as he crosses a river and even hopping onto an ostrich for a ride br br like it's predecessor tarzan and his mate does suffer slightly from some bad effects and unconvincing propsÂdodgy back projection a few laughable monkey suits more indian elephants masquerading as their african cousins and poorly disguised trapeze swingsÂbut these shouldn't spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining film if anything they make it even more fun br br 8 5 out of 10 rounded up to 9 for imdb
<START> would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it
<START> jack black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing but in this movie br br besides the direction writing lack of plot constant mugging aided and abetted by constant straight on camera shots and a 050 joke batting average it was still an utter waste of time the idea sounds promising but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction i've seen this side of you tube br br i kept hearing that this film portrayed mexicans very negatively while that's no doubt true i really don't think this movie is meant to be racist i think that's it's more a result of a creative team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess you can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera hey look it's an ugly mexican laugh people please for the love of all things tenacious laugh br br but put the racism charges aside when you get down to it it's anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended imo

<START> how can a movie be both controversial and gentle this one does it with a near perfect structure no one wants their daughters to be athletes apparently most cultures don't want their daughters to be small breasted either here we see a bunch of superb actors we've never heard of before portray folks of different cultures living fairly humdrum lives until their female children want to and have the potential to become professional soccer players the structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful there is no condescension both cultures are seen as modern and valid and yes both are silly too one flaw the hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives but not one child among them
<START> and how they bore you right out of your mind the crater lake monster is one of the classic bad films from the 70's made with no actors of any note an embarrassing script woeful direction and a tireless desire to fuse horror with light comedy this movie introduces a paleontologist who finds drawings of an aquatic dinosaur underneath crater lake a meteor falls from the sky and an aquatic dinosaur of the claymation variety begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants surrounding crater lake the whole matter is taken care of by steve our local sheriff much of the film when not showing pools of blood left behind from what we imagine must have been the beast dining is spent following the bumbling antic of two guys named arnie and mitch who run a boat rental place they try so bad to be funny that we get lines like looking at a business sign mitch saying to arnie you spelled bait wrong it's spelled b a t e the laughs were rather scarce here we then see them get drunk together and imagine a tree trunk to be the dinosaur laurel and hardy watch out the dinosaur looks fake but the movie is fun in a bad way and at the very least the lake is beautiful
<START> don't be fooled by the silly title folks this is one sweet ride a true successor to tetsuo the iron man and ichi the killer this gem starts with a bang and lays the gore on thick until the credits roll it seems that aliens are taking over people's bodies and modifying them into war machines which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the amusement of their species the winner of the battle eats the loser alive that's mostly it for plot but who cares when the gore is this good i have no idea how many buckets of slime were used but it's disgusting to behold there is interesting and effective use of stop motion when the takeovers are in progress and loving care is lavished on all of the creature and make up effects the cgi is a bit limited but that actually doesn't detract from the overall quality one bit at least for me this was truly a fun and stomach turning film that deserves much praise and has truly earned its place in the stack of cult classics find it and watch you won't be disappointed
<START> i am not one of those people who just go online after i see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made if you doubt me please look at my other reviews however for the first time ever i have seen a movie so horrible that i wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over br br i love bad movies to me ed wood is a genius i thought bloody murder jeepers creepers and most horrible horror movies were good however there is not a single good thing i can say about this film br br the plot is basically non existent if someone reading my review wastes their money to see it they can discern for themselves what the plot might be but i advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie br br the special effects are bad br br the acting is bad br br the two leads are attractive but that's all there is br br i am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone but i invite anyone to email me at foxbarking yahoo com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it i will tell you anything br br i love bad movies and i love horror and i love new inventive movies i even love horror porn stuff like hostel which some reviewers claimed this was like but obviously they only thought so cause roger bart was in this and hostel 2 but this may be the number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever made br br and before you disregard this review this is coming from someone who not only sat through the entire premiere of house of the dead but actually bought a copy of it
<START> listening to the director's commentary confirmed what i had suspected whilst watching the film this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie the plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when they're going through that i could write a book screenplay award winning sitcom phase there's a germ of an interesting idea buried in there probably because its a sequel to some one else's movie but it is totally buried under an underwritten badly executed and laughably un thought out script br br the lines are dire and the performances are un engaging though again i'm inclined to blame the director he does not appear to have consulted the actors at all about what is required rather plonked the script in their hands pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it who knows with a little coaching these actors could have acquitted themselves better say what you like about musicians in movies jon bon jovi was excellent in row your boat and more than acceptable in the leading man br br as it stands the cast have no chemistry whatsoever a beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when in order to infect bon jovi's character with vampire blood from his ailing co hunter he is given a transfusion she should have bitten him mind you they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too the only real moment of sexual tension between the two female leads is by the directors own admittance accidental he had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition so i suppose the finished product could have conceivably been worse but not a lot br br frankly as movies go this is badly plotted silly and forgettable even as trashy movies go it's not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining it could have been a fun and bloody little romp but the director has left with more of a comedy for all the wrong reasons
<START> once upon a time there was a science fiction author named h beam piper who wrote a classic book named little fuzzy which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet mr piper died in 1964 but hollywood and many of today's authors starting looting his grave before his cadaver got cold this is the book where they got the idea for ewoks from br br skullduggery is such a blatant ripoff of little fuzzy i can wonder why i'm the only who's ever noticed br br but don't take my word for it here's a link to project guntenberg where you can download a copy of little fuzzy for free http www gutenberg org ebooks 18137
<START> thank you hollywood yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap shallow effect heavy and redundant remake the original planet of the apes was an intelligent and thought provoking movie with a very clear message it was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting br br this movie on the other hand seems to have done away with pretty much all the dialogues instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum character interaction and development are non existent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on instead we get a bunch of pointless action scenes some marginally funny one liners and some very hollow quasi intelligent conversations br br the only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic the make up of the apes is magnificent and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too however this does not distract from the fact that planet of the apes 2001 is a very shallow and simplistic movie filled with paper thin characters stupid dialogue and a nearly non existent plot please hollywood stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters br br oh yeah the ending did not make any sense whatsoever br br out of stars mainly for the visuals br br
<START> i was interested to see the move thinking that it might be a diamond in the rough but the only thing i found was bad writing horrible directing the shot sequences do not flow even though the director might say that that is what he is going for it looks very uninspired and immature the editing could have been done by anyone with 2 vcrs and the stock was low budget video i would say that it wasn't even something as simple as mini digital video br br there are some simple ways to fix a film with what the director has like through editing etc but it is obvious that he just doesn't care there is as much effort put in to this movie as a ham sandwich it could be made better but that would mean extra work
<START> after having seen and loved postal yes i actually loved postal i decided to try another uwe boll film and i picked out seed because i happened to stumble on it in a local dvd store and it's supposed to be one of his better films br br while the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher films i've seen so far including a massive amount of plot holes unrealistic emotional responses and sub par acting it seems like boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it maybe he should stick to comedy the few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere that the special effects are better than i expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere but the unbalanced pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch which ruined my experience altogether there are a very fairly well done shocking scenes but they seem to be there for the shock value alone and let's not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times br br i hope uwe boll will one day learn what makes a good film because between a lot of horrible films he does seem to make a decent film every now and then seed just isn't one of those
<START> someone release this movie on dvd so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the so called films of the 1990's and see how vapid they were for the most part and how lars von trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece as it stands zentropa or europa as it is referred to outside the us is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the bleakness and almost psychotic uncertainty that oozed out of post wwii europe namely the decimated german landscape whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of its people von trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen you will feel like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940's with the perfectly lighted black and white scenes while at the same time feel you are on the brink of something beyond the cutting edge especially in scenes like the assassination aboard the train literally when you see this movie you are witnessing the evolution of an art form br br for some reason von trier got caught up in his own dogma movement shortly after this and while his breaking the waves and dancer in the dark are classics in their own right it is with zentropa that he truly lifted the art of film making to new and exciting heights 10 10 ages like a fine wine and begs for a dvd release
<START> it's made in 2007 and the cg is bad for a movie made in 1998 at one part in the movie there is a stop motion shot of a dinosaur that actually looks good but this just makes the extremely amateur work on the cg stuff look even worse br br the writing acting directing and everything else in this movie is just terrible this is as bad as if not worse than raptor island and 100 million bc pure crap again as with the other movies the only scary part about this movie is that it actually got made and is now being aired on the sci fi channel br br i still can't understand how they somehow get people who do have some acting skills to act in these movies and then somehow get them to act as terrible as everyone else in the movie br br for those of you who are unsure the other poster is obviously being sarcastic in his review or he is one of the people who worked on this movie
