<START> i've seen the first of the dwarf movies and sometimes i had little fun watching it there are many famous tv comedyactors appearing in the first part and presented in fantasy costumes typical little episodes of their stand up program and exactly that is the problem the second movie has to struggle with everything was already there nothing new to obtain you're familiar with most of the often boring and dumb jokes and you always feel like their goal was to put in every comedylooser of the last decade who wants to get back on stage there's nothing important about the story typical fairy tale story of rumpelstiltskin without any importance i expected something like that but that's nothing i could complain about i'm actually complaining about the lazy story writers who had an entire background story their only business was to get many jokes and parodies inside but they didn't get it anyway this crap is except the great appearance of helge schneider a total waste of time and money if you don't like him then remove 2 points of my evaluation if you like to save your money and get bad jokes then watch the crap that's broad casted every friday evening on sat1 or rtl for free i'm sure you will recognize some laugthers i saw last night in cinema
<START> i see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in august though the movie was not released in the us at least until the middle of september maybe these are unhappy expats living in s korea who saw it early i am in the us and just saw it today i thought the special effects were excellent better than the trailer the story was non western but i think we are all used to this from many other movies it wasn't at all hard to follow the acting by the leads was weak but other people were quite good there was humor throughout too i rated it at 8 because i had a good time watching it which is what i went for
<START> i can't believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness of course brooks has not made a comedy about real homeless people no mention of drugs prostitution or violence on these streets the people we meet in this movie are homeless in fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they don't eat quite as often brooks' movies have become worse and worse over the years this is just another nail in the coffin
<START> cannon pulled off a real visual beauty of a medieval epic that appears fascinating except for the dragon prop now just how did the long gone studio known for chuck norris movies ever come up with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place case in point the amateurish acting and horrible plot is a sign that reviving the medieval legend is no cure for some lousy execution they actually went on and made another cheap exploitationer featuring hundreds of lusty bimbos just to make this look even better for the two barbarian brothers they sure know how to make weird noises than becoming brave warriors so strong and bold enough to save their native land this is the single greatest waste of potential i've seen from an expensive low budget movie and worse enough to let an axe strike through the gorgeous print without mercy all of this followed an advertising campaign that sold t shirts based on the barbarians the movie alone makes a great souvenir
<START> the mummy's tomb starts with a review of the events in the mummy's hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the united states of america where the current high priest and the mummy kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past br br while i absolutely loved the mummy with boris karloff as the mummy imhotep and quite liked the mummy's hand with tom tyler as kharis which is the direct prequel to this film i was not as taken with the mummy's tomb br br it is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting lon chaney jr is okay as kharis but doesn't really stand out and i guess that's my main criticism of this movie that nothing really stands out there's nothing really terrible here but nothing really outstanding either so the viewer is left with a rather bland mummy's tale
<START> first i bough this movie on vhs than i just had to buy it on dvd it is on of my favorite movies of all time i have read the book but i really think the movie is much better i loved gwyneth paltrow as emma and jeremy northam as mr knightley was an excellent chose he was brilliant br br it's a 10 10 movie br br
<START> reed diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who's been in a mental asylum for over a decade after he was found wondering the back roads with blood on his hands the doctors want to test out an experimental new drug that'll return his lost memories if it works but when the drugs give him hallucinations of a demon he chooses to escape instead while outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather greg grunberg mistreats his mother won't let her near the darkroom in his basement acts suspicious in general br br while the general 'mystery' of the film is a tad easy to identify way before it's revealed i found mr diamond's acting to be enthralling enough to keep my attention throughout in the interest of full disclosure i've been a huge fan of his since homicide and his brief but extremely pivotal role in the shield up through journeyman dollhouse not a great film nor a good one but serviceable enough although i did like it better than the previous films that i've seen from director writer michael hurst room 6 pumkinhead 4 mansquito br br eye candy one fleeting pair of boobs in a hallucination br br my grade c
<START> a famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend suddenly she kills him and runs away while an old lady gets a heart attack the name of the female assassin is sawa she is still going to school and works for an vicious criminal akai who is sleeping with her one day sawa finds out he killed her parents br br br br even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this vicious action thriller is an disappointing gore fest kite has style but it is still trash the weird plot about a teenage girl that kills people as an assassin tried to be scary and touching at the same time only causing the story to fall flat on it's face one of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good bad heroine sawa is falling together with a bodyguard from a building yet the dramatic structure isn't nearly as good orchestrated and the director yasoumi umetsu's weird and grotesque animation of the character's faces is awful not only that the intercourse sequences are just simply creepy br br grade 3 10
<START> i can't believe the positive reviews of this movie i thought it was one of the worst most poorly executed and poorly acted movies i have ever seen and the plot was completely ludicrous sp she starts making out with him while he's tied to the chair puh lease the worst part was that it wasn't even bad in a good laughable way just plain terrible i couldn't figure out why they even bothered to show it on hbo i thought belushi was ridiculously silly very unbelievable as an eccentric hit man idk i could go on again i am shocked by the positive reviews the only thing that kept me watching it is that it's fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad and the ending didn't disappoint in its silliness either live by the sword die by the sword ridiculous
<START> it is nice to see the likes of oliver stone brian depalma al pacino and even michelle pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage it is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable trite and pathetic pieces of film making of all time this movie represents the worst of hollywood br br what is this is it based on a true story well they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off usa today but then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the american drug subculture kind of like rocky on cocaine is it a movie about cuba or cubans for the life of me i don't believe there is a single cuban in this movie the accents are totally fake and scene with antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest american values the whole scene looks like something out of the dick van dyke show is this movie about miami it looks more like l a transposed in florida afterall a palm tree is a palm tree is this a romance novel the relationship between pacino and pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other is this a drug movie well no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned the behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water admittedly the acting is terrible br br let's get to the rest the music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a lawrence welk show i think i heard a polka the camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective clearly the photography budget was excessive the sound is bleached in a number of spots and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse the writing is appalling this is one of those movies were the script writes itself you are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks br br so i am going to ask is this even a movie it could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours but at least a drama series has some kind of focus maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together whatever it is movie or not it is a piece of crap
<START> the movie was much better than the other reviewer stated it's a nice family movie it has a fun fantasy aspect of some time travel the story revolves around a 14 year old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her apartment building of course no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances she finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and is able to help the girl's family in many ways she is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run it reminds me of a hallmark movie so give it a chance and decide for yourself it seemed to be aimed more towards children about 6 12 years maybe a bit older and it's pretty much pg or g rated i'm an adult who can appreciate a nice family movie i guess the other reviewer isn't
<START> well one has to give the director credit for how gutsy he was gutsy would be the right term not only did he use a total cast of five people no extras at all but he also decided to use sub par special effects with a confusing and boring plot he also and i am not kidding put a warning at the beginning of the movie that you might die of fright however they do promise a freeeeee coooofffffffiiiiinnnnn to have a creepy limping gardener is always a good move yaaa unique aaawwwwnnn br br if you watch mystery science theater 3000 you might've seen this they like to showcase horrible movies just to let you know br br a good gift for someone you hate
<START> i have to say that higher learning is one of the top 3 movies i have ever watched it has a brilliant cast and an equally brilliant director singleton shows how life in university can be there are 3 main story lines the skinheads the african americans and the homosexuals i was intrigued by all of the stories but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about kristen battling her feelings towards another girl the end was great after seeing the movie 25 times plus i still cry i would have given this movie an 11 but i have to settlefor 10 10
<START> most definitely the worst columbo ever dreamt up no murder and the abandonment of the tried and tested formula makes this a real drag falk looks bored throughout and so will you be if you waste anytime watching this
<START> my goodness is this movie bad i was totally misled by my local movie review because this is certifiable garbage yeah yeah good guys wear white bad guys wear black and the good guys always win now go home and hug your kids and feel how good hollywood has made you feel blech i can't believe this brain dead movie was made by wes craven i'm guessing he needed a little money to pay the mortgage so he made this piece of dung it is the sort of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe they could do as good or better than such an experienced director br br ya see a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her daddy to do a wittle il' bad thing or he's gonna hurt her daddy but being ms all american girl next door we know she's gonna save the day and beat the bad guys the end girl power rocks br br c'mon now only an idiot would find this entertaining a roller coaster ride let alone something fresh or new all those super duper reviews you see on this site are from industry hacks who are either making money off this flick paying back a favor or they have sold their souls to the devil br br rachael mcadams is beautiful yup that's it not a good performance not a horrible one she's just cute she would have had to show a whole lot of skin to save this movie she isn't tough enough to be a good female action lead br br cillian murphy was at least passable in 28 days but here he plays a dumb villain pretending to be a smart one he gets his ass kicked to and fro by the 5'5'' mcadams because after all she was a cheerleader and a field hockey player and i'm sure she owns all the tae bo tapes so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire i wouldn't trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7 11 br br ya see this movie was done before except before they did it well go re rent any of the die hard movies you have loved ones in danger international terrorists except the characters are more likable and believable and the bad guys are way more competent and interesting i simply don't understand how hollywood can continue to make such crap as if they were oblivious to the proper models they can readily copy no wonder movie revenues are down br br throw your 6 down the toilet and save yourself 2 hours of your life you'll never get back br br ciao freddyshoop
<START> this film sold for one dollar at wal mart on a dvd and so i do not feel like i lost anything for watching this film except my time enjoyed the acting of tom hanks robbie wheeling who was very young looking and gave an outstanding performance considering it was a horrible script the story is about college students who decided to play the game mazes monsters only in a very realistic setting robbie wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game at other colleges and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades robbie meets a very nice gal and has a romantic fling with her and once he starts playing the game he stops making love to her and acts like a monk there are some scenes in the film which are taken running around the former world trade center and also in the observation floor and roof area it is rather sad viewing this part of the film where so many human beings died because of evil in the world this is not a very good film except for tom hanks trying to keep the film above the sinking level of entertainment
<START> the movie has only one flaw unfortunately this flaw damages all credibility of the piece br br it starts with the condemnation of the israeli occupation of disputed territories it fails to address the reason israelis are there egypt syria iraq and jordan attacked israel this is why israel occupys their land because those countries lost it in a war they started br br the film also claims that israel has defied the u n by not complying with resolution 242 problem is 242 was rejected immediately upon it's inception by the palestinians making it void br br many films are put together well and can really show footage that changes minds but remember when watching anything believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see br br all participants in this film are known critics of israel and some have made many antisemitic public comments removing any possible credibility to their words br br all participants are in dire need of a actual history lesson taught objectively not by some palestinian sympathizer
<START> i loved this movie it was one of the years best pornos i remember watching it on starz or some god damn thing but it was great i only saw like half of it and i taped it and all i can say is i loved every minute of what i saw i didnt sleep for weeks after i saw this movie although i was very tired
<START> let me count the ways br br 1 a title only 'remake' that pulls out every clichÃ© in the slasher handbook br br 2 a plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic br br 3 a completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills br br 4 a pg 13 rating that insures no gore violence or sex br br 5 a villain that is not frightening or even mysterious br br 6 a cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn't possibly care about them br br 7 a lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere much unlike the original prom night br br 8 a script of dialog that's beyond poor it's mind numbing br br 9 a series of cardboard performances not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that br br 10 a completely inept teen targeted slasher remake that's not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination or even to show a puddle of blood br br it's a no brainer horror fans save your money br br bomb out of
<START> this film's kind of like conan the barabarian but with more sex rape and murder there is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers don't do a good job showing it which is a shame because it 'could' be a decent story richard hill gives a solid performance in the lead role as does the villain who sadly didn't appear in anything else of note the fight scenes aren't too bad either i love the way deathstalker lets his sword 'drink' the blood of his victims and there's plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout br br all in all not good but not necessarily that bad either
