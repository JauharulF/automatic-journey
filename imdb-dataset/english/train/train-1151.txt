<START> miscasting happens susannah yorke is a luminous young jane eyre and her performance is impeccable however edward rochester is supposed to be 35 white haired george c scott looks and behaves like an arthritic 80 jane's deceased uncle is in better shape he creaks and snarls obnoxious and grim he looks like an ax murderer who has sent his ax out to be sharpened we're not surprised he keeps a wife caged in the attic the great love story looks like a sado masochistic nightmare there is enough darkness in the novel but bronte's rochester is relatively young athletic powerful and charming when he chooses to be he has a fine speaking and singing voice a good mind and a conscience that he unsuccessfully attempts to stifle
<START> this film is awful the screenplay is bad the is script mediocre and even the sex scenes are worthless the thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking this movie was shot in a dark shadowy and monochromatic style a la war of the worlds which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film greg morrisey's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film the twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic the only highlight is sharon stone's performance as catherine tramell faithfully continued in this sequel but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings the only circumstance under which a basic instinct 3 should be made would be if michael douglas agrees to join the cast
<START> the movie was awful the theater was dead with silence 'cause everyone was embarrassed to be in there watching such trash i think someone gave jet li a lobotomy and made him perform a script with dialogue written by a five year old the martial arts are 'ok' but when put next to the jackie chan movies and the matrix you're better off seeing one of those
<START> need i say its a stinker i gave it a rating of 2 br br only watch it if you suffer from insomnia br br there's plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up but not much else happens in this movie there is no suspense no deep shocking secrets revealed no real threat to the heroine's well being a few disagreements slight raising of voices that's pretty much it the secrets are nothing that couldn't happen to anybody the last secret revealed in the film is totally predictable by that point br br the plot such as it is revolves around a young woman named faith meg tilly who is an artist who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very very wealthy older widowed woman and a growing mother daughter type relationship that the older woman craves with her br br it turns out the older woman's daughter cassandra is dead you can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces together br br even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two why he's still hanging around years after cassandra's death is a good question br br there's also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant a faithful butler who seems to do everything cooking cleaning serving the meal answering the door etc everything except apparently locking the door since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where faith is br br there's nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms and leaning forward on the edge of your seat because there is no mounting tension in this film just bland pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to time br br
<START> i watched full house when i was younger and i can not understand why i did i don't remember really enjoying the show i think i and the majority of americans watching this were hypnotized by its badness it will put you in a trance state and there is no going back i am still scarred but i try to move on i know it's a family show but that does not mean it has to be so bad the show is so clichÃ© with every episode ending with a talk from the dad to make everyone's problems go away the characters on the show are all loathsome there is a know it all cleaning obsessed corny father who you want to punch in the face every time he comes on screen we then have a supposed rocker uncle that is just there to look pretty for the moms that have to watch this crap we have another uncle who is completely unfunny who does lame bullwinkle impressions need i say more about him there is the eldest daughter who can not act and is always whining about something then a middle daughter who always says how rude to pretty much everything anyone says finally there is the youngest daughter michelle do not get me started on michelle played but the horrible actors known as the olsen twins if you believe in christianity i guess you would associate her with the antichrist she is always demanding things trying too hard to be cute is constantly saying duh and rolling her eyes which makes you want to smack her i am not a big fan of using a lot of physical abuse as punishment to children but in her case i would make an acceptation she needed it on a daily basis she is the most selfish character to ever be introduced to mainstream television one example of this is when her rocker uncle is busy doing his job in the attic the brat decides to constantly annoy him and demand attention he yells at her and she gets upset poor baby the rest of the episode is catering to her emotional needs and the uncle eventually apologizes to her ugghh the show will lower your iq along with slowly destroying your will to live i am surprised we don't hear in the news about full house being played in the background when police find people that have committed suicide do yourself a favor and do not watch reruns of the show you will thank me later
<START> what can i say i know this movie from start to finish it's hilarious it's an strong link to my past and will change the way i view film in the future hypothetically speaking the down fall there's no socrates johnson
<START> liked stanley iris very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie
<START> at first look of the plot tagline i figured it could have been a decent film could i have ever been more wrong the beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget film for the first 10 minutes you don't notice the cheesy acting horrible sound and god awful special effects but then it gets worse just about 20 minutes into it i was asking myself what was the plot again i could only ask that question when i wasn't busted out laughing from the sheer lameness of this film the main actor has one setting for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the entire film even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything in between the flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me re live one extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie now we hit the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to rip off morpheus from the matrix although he is doing just a horrible job the actor's talking about star wars and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable now at the end of the movie you don't realize that it's the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is finally developing the morpheus character dies the only good thing about the movie he utters a couple words and the credits roll what is this no plot bad acting cheesy everything it couldn't get any worse please if you value human decency do not watch this movie
<START> i saw the omen when i was 11 on tv i enjoyed the trilogy so when the chance to finally see one at the cinema came around i didnt pass it up i went in to the cinema knowing that what i was about to see wasnt a cinema release but a made for tv film however being a fan i couldnt resist but this omen movie which i saw at a midnight screening didnt bring chills it brought laughter risible dialogue such as it is written that if a baby cries during baptism they reject there god what nonsense no decent set pieces faye grant so good in v is wasted with this script from hell no suprises and no fun however i did laugh out loud several times at our bad it was truly pathetic 1 out of 10
<START> just after the end of wwii powell pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the uk the usa at the time there was a lot of overpaid over sexed and over here type of comments somehow they came up with this masterpiece br br my favourite movie of all time it's got everything romance poetry emotion religion drama and very quirky br br i can never explain exactly why but it hits all the right buttons and although i've seen it hundreds of times yes really i'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points throughout br br was it the magnificent acting the wonderful sets the inspired script who knows but do watch it and you'll see what i mean
<START> let me confess i found this video used and bought it because guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket but inside was another story besides the fact that the movie was basically a parody of invisible man genre special effects highly visible strings and other such paraphernalia the script wasted no chance in fact it went out of its way in insulting all non wasp races and real or imagined homosexuals every insult aimed at a person in the script was either homophobic or racist or both it starts to grate on your nerves along with the shaky sound candid camera style photography and melodramatic story however the end is somewhat of a surprise but by the time you get there you hardly care less too bad it could been a reasonably good movie
<START> this film exhibits artful cinematic techniques wherein instead of landscape capturing the attention of the camera it is small details in how someone appears how the woman may be wearing a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet how the husband may be wearing a hat and socks and shoes and his underwear and both seem so completely at ease and comfortable how provocative the woman is posed is another feature of the tableau that the director chooses to let us know she is a free spirit sexually and aims to get the pleasure she seeks without flirting directly or with any particular sensitivity to what the man may be feeling the relationship between the wife and husband is unique it is an open one wherein she holds nothing back feels no particular shame for how she has behaved and wants to share these facts with him because her primary focus always is on the fact of their marriage nothing and no one can come between the two of them only the chances of fate can intervene his imprisonment during the war and what follows after his return at long last a very intriguing film which is totally absorbing
<START> although i was in this movie playing the part of sheriff hodges it still managed to make me jump in several places and believe me i'm not that easy you might say that i'm biased about the film and ok i am but i didn't see the finished product until 12 27 2006 and was extremely pleased i'm not a horror film fan as such but love the old b movies and black and white sci fi films this movie will make you think you know when something is going to happen then it doesn't then it does it will keep you completely off balance i would suggest watching the movie first then the director's notes and special features it is so well written directed and filmed and i can tell you personally that it was a real joy to work with this cast and crew i sincerely hope to be part of brian and laurence's future projects
<START> disjointed unclear bad screenplay poor photography and direction all in all very obviously an ill conceived first effort at commercial film making by the good people at tbn br br tbn pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring china cry the story of nora lam to the big screen but the omega code is an unfortunate miscue as a christian who supports tbn and a lot of its programming and who loved china cry i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone they do much good with their ministry but this isn't an example of it don't waste your money go rent china cry instead
<START> lolita is a rebel and she's going to share to our wide open eyes some little sex stories between sci fi and fantasy well this surrender cinema production is not very good very bad acting horrifying music and a story line without any story and any line but the sex scenes are pretty well done lot of lesbian scenes and jacqueline lovell as beautiful as in the exotic house of wax offer to us a very good final and very hot strip show for lovell's fans only
<START> this is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the last this time the spoof is mainly on the ring signs and 8 mile for some weird reason in my opinion this movie was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny i laughed maybe three times and that is not enough for a comedy i really enjoyed the first two but this one was just plain dumb if your jokes consist of corpses getting beat up and people constantly throwing stuff at each other then this movie is for you in my opinion if your smart enough stay at home and save your money and please stop making these kind of movies they just keep getting worse 3 10
<START> i should preface this by stating that i am a dolph lundgren fan the man turns out some of the funniest action clichÃ©s imaginable and detention is probably my personal favorite spoiler even though there is no such thing as a dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a harley with a sub machine gun through a high school hallway and the kid wins good game the oscar goes to detention dolph if you're reading this thanks for the laughs old friend br br in summary terrific movie that is a guaranteed laugh i recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it hilarious
<START> take a pinch of goodfellas mix it with the godfather add some roman mythology and plenty of lowbrow comedy and you have the sopranos about a mob clan operating out of northern new jersey it's almost as entertaining as pro wrestling i am not the biggest fan of this show but i do admire james gandolfini's very complicated tony soprano a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience i also have come to admire te contributions of folks like gravel voiced dom chianese as the bewildered but murderous uncle junior silver haired tony sirico as the perpetually perplexed paulie and the very beautiful edie falco as the duplicitous tough as nails carmela soprano the violence is sudden and graphic the body count steadily climbs each season but it is often the small moments that matter most here watch paulie and tony's nephew christopher michael imperioli late of law order as they get lost in the pine barrens and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandoned trruck both convinced they've had it
<START> i have to confess right off that i have never been a fan of rodney dangerfield indeed from me he gets no respect i watched this only because my wife wanted to see it and found exactly what i expected a stupid story without any real humour it's full of lame crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a developer's dangerfield plans to build a ski resort in utah that just didn't capture my attention at all br br in addition to dangerfield the film starred a weak cast including the likes of andrew dice clay and the totally over the hill john byner i didn't even know he was still around until i saw his name in the credits for this br br this truly is a dangerfield disaster br br 2 10
<START> i just sat in the theater bored as hell i wanted to leave halfway through the movie the plot is simple 4 samoan guys wreck weddings so they have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding yawn br br the thing that peeved me off the most was the so called crude jokes they were highly unfunny clichÃ©d and thrown in your face to make you get into the already dull movie the acting was below average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot br br all in all one of the worse movies i've seen of 2006 unfunny bad acting just ugly br br well thank god a friend shouted me br br avoid
