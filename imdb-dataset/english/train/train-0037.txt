<START> one of the last classics of the french new wave for direction cineaste jean eustache drew from the simplicity of early century cinema for story eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life so many things can be said of this film observationally brilliant self indulgently overlong occasionally hilarious emotionally draining etc etc in my mind whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths every film student writer or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts no music video overstyling no soap opera like plot twists and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie everything is to be admired the writing concise clever surprisingly funny acting everyone quite simply is perfect in their respective roles and simple direction the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film make this film unforgettable this is undoubtedly a film that stays with you
<START> at what point exactly does a good movie go bad when does a movie go from watchable to where's that off switch thank goodness for dvds like this one that can be borrowed from the library for free likewise thank goodness for the fast forward switch on the dvd player i feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box office br br at one point i've forgotten exactly when because now it's all just a blur our hero luke wilson starts running through traffic i think he was looking for a cab it was at that point when i gave up realizing i couldn't care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck br br the last time the movie was interesting was when luke wilson climbs out of the dumpster hair dryer in hand and first meets the heroine uma thurman that scene ended with the purse snatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far far above the departing luke and uma that was the last time the movie was funny and when was that scene ten minutes into the flick br br every time the movie tried to become funny it couldn't every time the movie approached excitement it fizzled out heading in the opposite direction when a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard the sound track stayed empty and silent br br the sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish when uma turns into the crazy ex girlfriend i felt like i was watching the 40 year old virgin meets pulp fiction that's when i realized that there was no turning back because i thoroughly disliked the 40 year old virgin and pulp fiction br br luke wilson's sidekick rainn wilson also seen in the dreary the last mimzy adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie rainn wilson the king of television boredom should stay with that equally awful medium hey rainn wilson leave full length motion pictures alone every time uma's rival anna faris came on screen i expected jason or freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery once you see anna faris in scary movie that's all you ever see no matter the movie no matter the medium the character played by wanda sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick
<START> the script is nice though the casting is absolutely non watchable no style the costumes do not look like some from the high highbury society comparing gwyneth paltrow with kate beckinsale i can only say that ms beckinsale speaks british english better than ms paltrow though in ms paltrow's acting lies the very nature of emma woodhouse mr northam undoubtedly is the best mr knightley of all versions he is romantic and not at all sharp looking and unfeeling like mr knightley in the tv version p s the spectator cannot see at all mr elton ms smith relationship's development as it was in the motion version so one cannot understand where was all emma's trying of make a elton smith match besides of the portrait
<START> this movie was an impressive one my first experience with a foreign film it was neither too long nor too complex i myself enjoyed the subtitles and the plot was surprisingly fresh the story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and retarded brother after a long separation appeared cliched at first but it proved to be very touching and realistic there was also some subtle humor so as not to depress or bore the audience
<START> i watched the malayalam movie boeing boeing made in 1985 which in turn is probably inspired by an english movie of same name long back the basic story of garam masala is the same but it is told in a pathetic way the classy jokes replaced by routine ones which are found in normal hindi movies probably the director did this to suit the taste of hindi audience br br i haven't seen the english original but had really enjoyed the malayalam film made by priyadarshan himself which was a side splitting comedy back then of course the acting by mohanlal mukesh and sukumari who did the cook's role was so natural and spontaneous br br probably i am too smitten by the malayalam film that i cannot tolerate even the smaller flaws in its hindi remake but i still feel that akshay kumar and john abraham have overacted paresh rawal has done a decent job but doesn't reach anywhere near sukumari br br but all in all its ok if one compares it to other recent hindi comedy movies
<START> hey br br if your going to make a documentary about leonard cohen try making it about leonard cohen this is filled with only enough leonard to anger the viewer who will be left wondering why they are listening to all these other singers some of them questionable talk about themselves puleeze sounds like them reliving their diary entries in junior high who cares about you what about leonard guess what people if you do something worthy maybe someone will make a documentary about you i found particularly insulting the parading of u2's members as if that would add credibility to this movie not leonard doesn't need bono or the edge talking about his spirituality what would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody some piece of his spirituality through the film gee what a concept i will give props to rufus wainwright and jarvis cocker for their covers of cohen tunes the rest of the performances were a bore and some were unbearable br br cohen fans don't say i didn't warn you
<START> after an anonymous phone call about a spacecraft that would have crashed in a frozen wood two police officers find evidences that the event really happened and apparently one martian had walked away from the spot they drive to the nearby hi way cafÃ© and they find a bus stopped and seven passengers waiting the reopening of a snowed in bridge however the driver tells that he had only six passengers when he parked the bus while interrogating the travelers weird things happen in the diner with the lights switching on and off and the turntable turning on and off when the passengers are released and the bus follows his travel one passenger returns to the diner and discloses a plot of invasion of earth br br will the real martian please stand up is one of the best episodes of this great series the intriguing story has ironic and witty dialogs funny characters and situations and a surprising and totally unexpected plot point in the very end my vote is eight br br title brazil o marciano the martian
<START> this mini series is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and grander aspirations sotd falls somewhere between kung fu and h r pufnstuff on the entertainment spectrum if it weren't so long nearly 3 hours i think that kids would like it quite a bit it's got adventure action cliffhanger scenes and not too much romance or other icky stuff when you're young you're not too critical of flexing rubber swords campy acting and scenes that are repeated at least two scenes are repeated identically in the movie just as was done in old time serials in order to bring the audience up to speed finally kids are usually more accepting of american english dialogue coming out of the mouths of asian actors not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by non asian actors br br i was going to give this movie three stars but i felt like the director producers and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project this movie is not art but like painting your house it actually took some time effort and discipline to get it made br br overall not a recommended use for your time but it might keep the kids entertained while traveling in the mini van br br oh yeah hey imdb dialogue is the preferred and traditional spelling your spell checking seems to think that dialog is the proper spelling while dialog is acceptable both webster's and the oed consider it an alternative form
<START> if there's one thing you can count on disney to do it's their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again even watching the commercial for lady and the tramp ii was a horrible experience disney's going to ruin one of their most awesome classics ever it even had that spaghetti meatball scene it's been done before and that's what i say to this sorry direct to video the entire concept should be banned everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of bluth's really bad movies the penguin and walrus duo i've even forgotten their names are just a really poor carbon copy of timon and pumbaa morgana is another ursula she even repeats practically all her old lines the songs are pathetic really abysmal i've never heard songs so bad from them before until now and the dialogue is atrocious it's pathetic and simplistic on the plus side at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent all of the usual characters aren't as annoying as they used to be or maybe that's a minus for little mermaid fans back on the negative melody is just so sickeningly cute you just might vomit i almost did do yourself and your little mermaid fan a favor don't waste your money on this true it's not as horrific as return of jafar or pocahontas ii but that's little consolation
<START> wow what would you do with 33m let me give you a choice you can either a shred it and flush it down the toilet or b make a film based on the premise of whoopi goldberg as a hard nut futuristic cop partnered with a rubber dinosaur who uses terms like i didn't butt trumpet and blows raspberries on the basis that this is funny that's right you would choose the option that has more merit flushing down the toilet br br this has to be seen to be believed i cannot even find the words to describe how bad this film is it doesn't even fit into the so bad it's good category i actually have it on the television as i write and whilst watching i felt the need to come onto imdb and register my disgust br br considering jurassic park was made a couple of years before how on earth did they think that audiences would any longer tolerate a man dressed in a rubber suit wg should have simply walked and damn the consequences everyone concerned will go to hell for this criminal waste of money br br i have to stop writing i am about to implode
<START> i noticed that this film has taken the brunt of a lot of insults it probably earned some of them but it wasn't that bad well i'll be honest i never want to see this film again it was a bad film but i don't hate this film it tried to tell a story as a drama this film could work very well actually i just think the filmmakers misgauged which road to take when they made this they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy with a rewrite it could have been a great film but as a satire it didn't work in its current form many scenes did not fit within the context of the plot for example the robbery scene makes little sense in the story still it wasn't the worst independent film ever made is it in the top 10 worst that's debatable
<START> this is jackie chan's best film and my personal favourite after the disappointing u s made 'the protector' directed by james glickenhaus jackie took the concept and placed it slap bang into hong kong this is also probably jackies most violent movie with the audience cringing at the bone breaking stunts br br the action is fast and furious jackie and his crew really did put max effort into the fight design bones were broken and blood spilt in the process of making this film as you'll see in the credits br br the script is a simple cops and robbers affair nothing special after all it was written around the action i must say that the english version has some dodgy dubbing but it shouldn't put you off too much br br so get the lads round crack open the beers and enjoy by the way the film was nicknamed 'glass story' by the stunt crew why i'll let you find out for yourself
<START> i watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away it is a real masterpiece of art and i don't understand why most of the people think it's garbage the main idea of the movie take your ego away and then you will have true power this was the main battle at the end of the movie and guy ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way the greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look do you remember this from the movie because our true enemy is in us it is our ego that voice that always tells us that we are important that gives us our pride that tells us not to give but only to take that creates our aggression that wants to be in control that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts gr expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance a superb movie
<START> it's very sad that lucian pintilie does not stop making movies they get worse every time niki and flo 2003 is a depressing stab at the camera it's unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in romania the worst of them get to be sent abroad e g chicago international film festival this movie without a plot acting or script is a waste of time and money score 0 02 out of 10
<START> there have been race pictures almost from the beginnings of the movie business films starring almost entirely black casts have been made by segregated poverty row studios more often than not owned by caucasians for ghetto theaters with the growing urban blight during the 1970s this idea was revived with a wave of blaxploitation pictures made for urban grind houses which overlaid black actors and funky atmosphere over traditional b movie plots this trend even spread into horror features with titles like blacula blackenstein and sugar hill serving up blaxploitation versions of monster standards and it didn't die with the closing of most urban theaters Â it just slowly eased into the video age and continues with low budget direct to dvd releases like this one ed and jose quiroz's hood of the living dead adopts the recent popularity of horror movies for the hip hop audience ricky carl washington is a young scientist in oakland trying to keep his younger brother jermaine brandon daniels out of trouble after the death of their parents after jermaine is shot by drug dealers in a drive by ricky decides to use the experimental cell regenerating formula he's been working on in an attempt to save the teen's life apparently his efforts are for naught and jermaine's body is taken away however the body never makes it to the morgue Â jermaine re animates in the coroner's van as a flesh hungry zombie he kills the drivers then goes after the gang that killed him spreading the zombie infection wherever he goes having heard from jermaine's friends kevin derek taylor ii and marco raul martinez about the attack on the gangsters ricky feels that the only thing to do is to capture jermaine and try to cover up the whole matter before he and his accomplice scott chris angelo get arrested for the mayhem they've caused however they soon find that the contagion is spreading too fast for them to control it by keeping things simple the quiroz team manages to produce an entertaining little horror feature without overextending themselves to the point where things start to look shoddy along the way they also add in a few interesting bits of business when first confronted with a zombie scott tells ricky shoot him in the head like in the movies Â an effective as any way to discover how to kill zombies an extra twist is added when the first head shot doesn't kill the brain adding to viewer unease another good point is that the soundtrack makes only limited use of sub eminem style rap laying in standard creepy music throughout
<START> spoiler alert br br soooo arnie's really a good guy but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobeying of orders he's sent to jail or rather some sort of work camp he escapes but after a short while he's caught once again this time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he's supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes and eventually die but we all know arnie and we all know that he's tougher than even the toughest of tough guys br br i really wanted to like this movie being an arnie fan and all however the running man contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me e g the reconstruction of arnie's fight inside the helicopter where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident complete with 5 10 different camera angles this means that the military helicopter in which arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members one of which inside the eye of one of the crew members arnie beats br br there are other flaws also and the plot which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative works for a while then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drowns br br the acting can't really be said to be anything better than sub par with arnie in the leading role doing an average arnie performance the rest of the cast get by without being especially good or bad br br the special effects are ok without being impressive br br rating 3 10
<START> zp is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement the college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement the explosion that daria imagines represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally mark's death anticipates the end that a sees for the movement itself the film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life during the 60 ' and 70' young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change one of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from i watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and appreciated the magnificent way in which a depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct repression was the way to 'control' social outbursts at that time and that is the method police applies to stop the students this society suffers from hipocresy and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls the dialogue between the policeman with the college professor who's detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom the stealing of the plane represents mark 's inner wish for it but his going back or coming back or returning segun shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ' ve said a depicts the death of the dream by these difficulties winning the game in my point of view a film to remember
<START> i really liked zb1 really i did i have no problem with extremely low budget movies and i have enjoyed movies with worse production values than zb3 if you can imagine such a thing check out 'wiseguys vs zombies ' if you're interested indeed i prefer lower budget zombie films because i am suspicious that hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are 'about ' br br but zb3 was just so bad it was retarded i don't want to bother being dignified in my criticism i want my 90 minutes back etc except that it really only took 80 minutes because partway through i put it into 1 4x fast forward br br okay here's some criticism br br 1 the pacing was terrible everyone talked in monologues even when someone just had a single line the camera work and the editing and the insertion of a bunch of f bombs into every sentence made the line feel like a monologue at first i was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to zb1's 70 minutes but there were actually fewer 'events' in zb3 it's all talking br br 2 the gore effects got stupider just glop rubbed around on people's tummies br br 3 despite the epic exposition there really wasn't a plot and the exposition is indeed epic i won't spoil it if you're going to watch it don't watch it but then it's just a bunch of lame characters walking around and bickering for 80 minutes or fewer if you so choose
<START> major payne was really not very good at all despite being funny here and there the story was ridiculous and the acting was poor major payne's voice and temperament were especially annoying the idea was ridiculous and the things that the boys had to do in that film were even more ridiculous i would not recommend this film to anyone
<START> basically caprica is the cylon origin story the premise of the show is interesting however the writers follow so many story lines and clog it with too many pov characters that it bogs down the storytelling the plot creeps at glacial speeds dissipating what tension it might have had in any given episode little or nothing happens br br daniel graystone eric stolz is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip unfortunately his only working prototype is driven by the ai version of his dead daughter zoe who died in a suicide bombing caused by soldiers of the one sto an underground monotheist extremist group br br meanwhile joseph adama father of battlestar galactica 's commander adama is struggling to hold his family together while searching for the ai version of his daughter who also died in the bombing in a machiavellian virtual version of caprica which strongly resembles 1930s chicago br br in addition to the vapid writing caprica suffers from a similar problem as many origin stories we already know how it ends i e the cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity
