<START> this is one of my all time favorite movies period i can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does this flick has it all action adventure science fiction good vs bad and even some romance without even an innocent peck on the cheek between the pazu and sheeta maybe best of all you don't have to be in mensa to get it and enjoy the movie like you do with some of miyazaki's other movies i don't know about you but i watch movies to take a break from thinking this is just a flat out enjoyable movie that everyone will like so do yourself a favor and go buy it the only sour note is the american dubbing i found vander geek to be just plain annoying but all is not lost the original japanese version is on the two disc set and it rocks who cares if you can't understand spoken japanese if you can read at a second grade level then watch the original japanese recording with english subtitles you won't regret it
<START> this movie is up there with the all time classics the music camera shots and acting are excellent showing the movie in black and white gave it a much better appearance and complemented the music perfectly like psycho its surprising how so few people have commented on this movie my guess is that its a hard movie to find i gave the film a 9 see the movie and you'll know what i'm talking about
<START> imagine a woman alone in a house for forty five minutes in which absolutely nothing happens then this goes on twice more the writing is flat and lifeless and jokes unfunny and the bad acting keeps you from caring about any of the characters even when they battle wolf packs and get beaten up by fraternity goons anyone that ranked this movie higher than a two is not fully sane
<START> take rambo mix in some miami vice slice the budget about 80 and you've got something that a few ten year old boys could come up with if they have a big enough backyard too much access to penthouse cop and ex commando mcbain busey and with a name like mcbain you know he's as gritty as they come is recruited to retrieve an american supertank that has been stolen hidden in mexico captured with the tank were hardbitten sgt major o'rourke jones mcbain's former love devon fluegel the officer in command now meat for the depraved terrorists spies drug peddlers who have no sense of decency blah blah blah for an action movie with depraved sex there's a dearth of action and not much sex the running joke is that mcbain gets shot all the time survives keeping the bullets as souvenirs apparently the writers didn't see the magnificent seven the man for us is the one who gave him that face nor thought to give mcbain even a pretense of intelligence even for a budget actioner the production values are poor with distant shots during dialog and very little movement the main prop the tank is silly enough for an ed wood production fluegel who might have been a blonde julia roberts she had a far bigger role in crime story than julia has to go from simpering to frightened to butt kicking back again on an instant's notice jones who's been in an amazing array of films pretty much hits bottom right here both he busey were probably just out for some easy money a couple of laughs look for talented future character actor danny trejo heat once upon a time in mexico in a stereotyped menacing bit part much too dull even for a guilty pleasure bulletproof is still noisy enough to play when you leave your house but want people to think there's someone home
<START> okay as you can see this is one of my favorite if not favorite films this is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious the main character is a business man who is stuck in a same thing different day mentality he sees a woman looking melancholy out a window of a dance studio from his train everyday and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her he decides to join the dance class only to find out she is not the instructor from there he bonds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing as well as finding out about the mysterious woman br br there is no gratuitous or any sex involved just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed br br this film was remade with richard gere and jennifer lopez and the new one while appealing is nowhere as enjoyable as the original the movie never made it big in america because it was not eligible for the oscars since it was broadcast on television in japan movies cannot be released on tv or they are disqualified for oscar nominations it did win numerous awards in japan for best film cast director etc for their oscar awards
<START> i caught this film on azn on cable it sounded like it would be a good film a japanese green card i can't say i've ever disliked an asian film quite the contrary some of the most incredible horror films of all time are japanese and korean and i am a huge fan of john woo's hong kong films i an not adverse to a light hearted films like tampopo or chung king express two of my favourites so i thought i would like this well i would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious badly acted film ever again br br i think the director steven okazaki must have spiked the water with quaalude because no one in this film had a personality and when any of the characters did try to act as opposed to mumbling a line or two their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake i honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before the only person who sounded genuine was brenda aoki i find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy because i didn't laugh once even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this a refreshing breath of comedy it was neither refreshing nor a breath of comedy and the ending was very predictable the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things br br avoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting i actually think that spike of bensonhurst is a better acted film than this and i walked out half way through that film
<START> this is perhaps the creepiest display of santa claus ever committed to any medium whether it be a book a picture or a movie santa looks like a perv looking down on the children and the twisted story of bringing merlin in to help him defeat one of satan's minions pitch doesn't make things any better it's laughable to say the least with bad effects even for 1959 standards if a kid were to watch this movie he'd have nightmares and never want santa to visit they'd be scarred for life imagine the kid's in a christmas story when they start screaming after being put on santa's lap that's how this would turn out if kid's see this movie
<START> in the comic modesty is strong alexandra staden who plays modesty blaise looks more like an anorectic fashion model she does not either have the moral or personality that modesty have in the comics modesty would never give a woman an advice to show more skin to earn more money i cannot see any similarities with my comic books with modesty and this movie its like a mission impossible movie would be about ethan hunt locked in the detention room in high school talking with the janitor about when he went to junior high school and hunt would have been played by dj qualls in road trip soo if you are an modesty fan do not see the movie you will just get angry if do not know much about the modesty comics rent an other movie do not wast your time with this one i cannot understand how quentin tarantino can put his name on it i will ask for a refund at my dvd rent store tomorrow
<START> this is a great documentary film any fan of car racing should own a copy of this outstanding film director stephen low did a great job as well as the main stars of the film father son mario michael andretti the dvd looks sounds amazing and best of all it's imax great home theater test disc
<START> david duchovny plays the lead role in this film now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it very unfair to say the least david made his name on the x files and is a decent actor dr eugene sands duchovny is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice by sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire raymond blossom however the fbi take an interest in using eugene to snare blossom angelina jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare the gangsters moll she puts in a solid performance timothy hutton playing blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character duchovny himself isn't as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his credible his familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but dosen't detract too much from the film
<START> this was what black society was like before the crack epidemics gangsta rap and aids that beset the ghettos in the eighties decent hardworking families that struggled to get by and all the traumas and tribulations they faced black america was a different group of people in the seventies still full of hope and flying high on the civil rights movements of the sixties times were hard but still worth fighting for keepin' your head above water making a wave when you can this show showed how black society struggled to work together as people and families before they started to prey on each other and everyone else in order to survive the horrors of the ghettos it is heart breaking to see what the black ghettos were like then and what they have become now
<START> i absolutely loved this film i was hesitant to watch it at first because i thought it would be too painful i remember how hard it was when john was shot however watching the two of us took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility i think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what might have been aidan quinn was adorable as paul and met the challenge head on i was impressed with his accent and mannerisms jared harris is also very talented and was quite believable as john my favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene which was so poignant the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction both of which i feel are appropriate given the circumstances
<START> i love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors i like raptors because they are scary my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana br br i really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think it's got a good ending even though i didn't really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings i figured it out over time and that's the important part the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you're watching it the first time br br this is best movie
<START> hidden frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best star trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was gene roddenberry's mission their focus on homosexuality depression war and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other trek series and movies the production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved the stories are more complex and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive in season 6 episode 1 countermeasures there is one of the biggest space battles in trek history the ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting the real draw to frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters there are also nods to other trek series and movies with places and characters we all know i recommend any trek fan to check out countermeasures and you will be hooked
<START> hi may be because i am not a theater major or a sophisticated movie watcher i think this movie is boring and dumb br br i rented this movie because of charles bronson and it's title but boy what a waste of time just watching 2 guys sitting in a vault and talking br br the movie on this dvd was so dark i had hard time watching the darn movie i realize it is a 1968 movie but they are putting it on a dvd then they should do some digital remastering br br also i was totally surprised to see these high marks on imdb for this movie like i said before i am not as sophisticated as the other folks who commented on this movie earlier
<START> i believe shakespeare explained what i just read beautifully me thinks he the lady doth protest too much the whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself he sites profane literature writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible a number of times however i can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible anyone can skew data prove anything they like but it doesn't make it true customs change word definitions change over time look at english german where it is very obviously a common root nothing stays the same it's always growing and changing the bible has many different translations but the king james version is the one i've found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research in the king james version you will notice there are certain words written in italics these words have been added by the translators and can be dropped the mean of the entire verse changes writings from around the time of christ were written without spaces without punctuation without paragraphs without numeric verses these writings look like one long word the translators added all of the above for example how would you read this godisnowhere do you read it as god is nowhere or do you read it as god is now here same string of letters two entirely different meanings this is why many biblical researchers use a 'lexicon' to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original arabic greek or hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written it's also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove god exists but you can not prove he doesn't exist in the end i just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty talk about ego putting soapbox away god bless maegi
<START> north africa in the 1930's to a small arab town on the edge of the sahara comes a beautiful woman looking for meaning to her life a handsome trappist monk fleeing from his crisis of faith they will meet and passions will be stirred but not even the sand diviner knows if they will find happiness or sorrow here in the garden of allah br br the plot is pure hokum but the film is still great fun beautiful to look at marlene dietrich charles boyer are a superb screen couple she is to put it simply gorgeous and boyer gives a most effective understated performance letting his sensitive face do much of his acting for him br br the supporting cast is excellent basil rathbone in a sympathetic role as a count who loves the desert joseph schildkraut as a friendly talkative guide all the arabic he others speak in the film is pure gibberish lucile watson as a gentle mother superior alan marshal as an honorable young french officer tilly losch as a dangerous dancer henry brandon as a comic porter john carradine as the mysterious sand diviner and magnificent sir c aubrey smith as a wise old priest br br movie mavens will recognize helen jerome eddy as a nun marcia mae jones bonita granville peeking over the nun's shoulder as convent girls gaunt nigel de brulier as a monastery lector and ferdinand gottschalk as a hotel clerk all uncredited br br color films of the 1930's are both rare lovely to look at and this movie is no exception the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself the garden of allah was the first technicolor film to be shot on location yuma arizona gave the film makers all the sand dunes they could desire but contaminated drinking water 135 degree heat soon had the company in revolt when the daily rushes showed boyer's face had burned a bright tomato red producer david o selznick finally gave in the remainder of the film was shot on a hollywood sound stage
<START> this move actually had me jumping out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do the acting was the best farrah should have gotten a oscar for this she was fabulous james russo was so good i hated him he was the villain and played it wonderful there aren't many movies that have riveted me as this one the cast was great alfie looking shocked with those big eyes farrah looking like a victim and you re lived her horror as she went through it farrah made you feel like you were there and feeling the same anger she felt you wanted her to hurt him yet you also knew it was the wrong thing to do the movie had you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with each scene
<START> all i can say about the necromaniac schizophreniac 2 series is if you are even remotely pc or don't have a seriously messed up sense of humor then you probably wont get it as sick and disgusting as this movie is it really is a comedy and not a horror movie at all if you can appreciate somebody who pushes the bounds of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits imaginable to the point where is becomes so out of hand that it's comical then you must see this to believe it this movie is so out of control that a major film studio couldn't touch this with a 10 foot pole with a condom on the end in my opinion though the best most extreme pieces of art come from way underground if you don't stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing then they reject it br br i have seen stacks of terrible boring z grade indy movies that were just a waste of a perfectly good vhs tape or dvd r i have also seen stacks of stink bombs coming from the big named studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars when a no budget film like these two from ron atkins john giancaspro come out and blow all of the other shock films completely out of the water you really have to take a second look at the whole indy movie scene after seeing this you can really see how much freedom an indy film maker can have when they work on their own br br the funny thing is even the other people who saw this movie and hated it admit to the fact that they laughed all the way through it i don't think that is is possible for anybody to get bored watching either of these two so if don't take everything that you seen in the mainstream media too seriously and are able to laugh at a misanthropic puppet wielding psychopath who has finally snapped you have to see this you may just be able to see it for the stand alone cult classic that it is both schizophreniac schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites in my collection of well over 1000 dvds
<START> this isn't as violent as i was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective br br there are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who's side a particular character is on br br the plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the triad gang it follows br br the violence when it comes is brutal no guns or martial art scenes with special effects this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the triad is a violent criminal organisation br br the ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable
