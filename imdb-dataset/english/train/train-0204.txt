<START> kusturika made it again another masterpiece a coral comedy full of his own landmarks with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments we laughed and laughed what a party the music is everywhere and also the shooting the animals the crazy bastards sex and amazing gadgets and inventions everything colorfully visual to entertain only pure cinema in essence a wonderful experience to watch and one is specially grateful since good comedies are so rare and so wonderful well this is one and if you enjoyed kusturica's previous films you'll love this although as in all comedies it is about a chemical reaction and you have to be in the mood for it
<START> this film is like a 1950 version of ettore scola's brutti sporchi e cattivi less sex and less realism but a tale with great humanism and warmth i wouldn't call this a neo realistic picture it's very sentimental and more like a fairy tale and should probably be classed as a comedy although it deals with serious matters a little like chaplin or 1930 comedy typical italian though very emotional and hard to resist except for a stone cold person the sentimentalism is a letdown although this picture was not meant to be a realistic drama it's not a masterpiece like umberto d or the bicycle thief but it is a lovable and hilarious comedy with good music br br 7 10
<START> the last wave is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind the title refers to the aboriginal doomsday theory there will be one last wave that wipes out everything br br david burton richard chamberlain is a sydney lawyer hired to defend some aborigines accused of murder around this time there has been unusually heavy rainfall in australia while defending the aborigines david learns the last wave theory and begins to wonder whether it's just mythology br br the movie's last sequence is a metaphor for descending into the depths of one's mind peter weir created a perplexing but thought provoking movie aboriginal actor david gulpilil whom you may have seen in walkabout crocodile dundee and rabbit proof fence provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendants br br if you get a chance watch the making of feature on the dvd peter weir explains some of the film's undertones some of which relate to richard chamberlain's background
<START> oh it's the movie i thought i waited too long to take out the dog i can't believe i watched the whole thing i guess i was optimistically anticipating that it was going to get better horribly disjointed dialog pathetic acting and totally improbable events like toby's mom hanging herself in the time it takes col to walk upstairs and back down in a room with a 24' ceiling and no chairs counters or anything around her motionlessly suspended body that she could have possibly used to climb on to do herself in the little girl that played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole movie and the puppy of the first couple was a close second the basic storyline has potential and with a good script and director could be a seriously creepy flick but this version sadly is not it i get more scared when i open my electric bill every month
<START> i recently bought this movie and i do not regret having it at all as a matter of fact i am very please have this movie to add to my collection matt manfredi and phil hay movie directors took less than one month to film and spent about 1 million eur to produce this great movie this proves that not only big productions make great movies br br the title of this movie fits in perfectly in computer language bug means program error which causes reactions in computer function our reactions can cause these negative side effects but also great moments of beauty the vertiginous happenings in this movie start with the death of a bug a man witnesses the crime on the other side of the road from there onwards everything gets complicated br br i point out john carrol lynch fargo wallece the man who cannot make everything right at all
<START> before watching this film i had heard a lot about it and certain scenes in the film but listening wasn't doing it for me so i planned on watching it and wow ned beatty ronny cox jon voight and burt reynolds make for an interesting group of individuals who are hell bent on canoing down the cahulawassee river and the unfortunate series of events that transpires upon them all the character development takes some time in enveloping the viewer with a better understanding of each person but eventually you know these guys like they were your friend the acting dialogue is very very real as close to reality as you can get for hollywood acting reynolds character lewis was interesting as a guy who comes off very tough but underneath the manly veneer lies a very soft and broken man i was impressed with his performance jon voight seems to be the character thats on the spotlight the most the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him at every corner really mold and caste him into a different man at the end his character transition was excellent ned beatty and ronny cox really seem like the silly lunkheads that just like to joke around and don't seem to get too awful serious unless they have too and they did i really was amazed at director boorman's vision of dickey's novel very impressed you cannot go your whole life without watching this film i give it eight out of ten stars extremely impressed
<START> this show is a great history story it's has everything from slavery the way they were treated religion the ways jews were sent into hiding the inquisition the belief in the orisha the african gods the way women were treated including the daughters even down to homosexuality the way the characters are intertwined and that violante that character saddens me she is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her i am so glad they decided to re release it to t v again although i would love to see the unedited version xica has become my heroine i look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it i love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century i look forward to my xica every night it would be great to dub it in english so the americans can love her too
<START> this is just a short comment but i stumbled onto this movie by chance and i loved it the acting is great the story is simple and touching and the lines especially from the 4 yr old desi are so cute and sad seek it out
<START> abc has done more for this show by allowing television veterans james garner and david spade to join the cast of this show at first the show was watchable and even predictable with john ritter and katey sagal john's loss shocked the world katey and the three kids are really a solid professional cast the hour lesson after john's death in real life struck home to me i lost my father at 17 years old and could sympathize and understand their pain and agony abc should be proud to maintain this show and even preserve this as john's final wish this show has matured and developed because of such impossible circumstances they should be rewarded with emmys
<START> this is one of the two postapocalyptic fantasy movies that albert pyun made in 1993 and it's the bad one apparently all his energy went into nemesis which was an entertaining non stop action movie and had a much more expensive look knights is clunky and cheesy a bottom of the barrel sci fi that too often resembles a video game new opponents pop up all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible the only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is kathy long not a particularly attractive woman but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine as for kris kristofferson considering his age at the time 58 i hope his stunt double was well paid 1 2
<START> any person with fairly good knowledge of german cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past if such a film is shown to people again it would surely click provided if it has something new fresh and captivating for today's challenging audiences this is also true for german film maker sylke enders as her film's principal protagonist kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend she is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting kroko was originally shot on dv to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser if someone were to state a positive aspect of sylke enders' film it may well be kroko's involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment it is with kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows
<START> ironic that dr seuss' fable emphasizing the non commercialization of christmas should be one of the most hyped marketed and successful blockbusters of the holiday season the general gist of ron howard's adaptation is that the grinch's bane against christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for cindy lou who played very well by taylor momsen this movie makes an ardent ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of seuss' story but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of chuck jones' animated version jim carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish grinch but whether it's the dialogue the pacing or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly there are some wonderful visuals and the make up work is amazing yet beyond the technical triumphs there's an element or two here that's missing br br succinctness br br soul br br or maybe jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25 minute cartoon that howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long howard carey and crew are all very capable and talented but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product if you must see the feature length version rent it on video with jones' animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better i give this film three cans of who hash out of five
<START> seems everyone in this film is channeling woody allen they stammer and pause and stammer some more only for really die hard denero fans it tries to appear as edgy and artistic but it comes off as looking like a very very low budget film made by college students the most often used word in the whole film is hum the film does peg the atmosphere of the late sixties early seventies though if you like films where people are constantly talking over each other horrible lighting even if it is for art's sake and makes you feel like you are sitting in on a lame political meeting then you might like this but you need to be really bored i found this cd in the dollar bin and now i know why
<START> what a dud it began with some promise then became unfocused and wandered john cusack's cajun accent was laughable bridget fonda's role existed only to get a skirt into the film and pacino did pacino his entire generation of actors nicholson hackman caine hoffman have developed a standard performance that each can deliver effortlessly or less charitably mail in in their paycheck films this was one
<START> not even the most ardent stooge fan could possibly like the movie i one of them the stooges just aren't given any material to work with it is really a shame too because this is the only feature length movie the stooges did with curly and this one effort by them is painfully unfunny when it could have had great potential awful musical numbers don't help any either the short they did with the same title has more laughs
<START> in 1955 tobias schneerbaum disappeared in the peruvian amazon one year later he walked out of the jungle naked it took him 45 years to go back supposedly keep the river on your right is a modern cannibal tale in reality anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed the first half of the movie is more like a travel log of new ginuea mostly touting the native art the second half relies on still photos of a peruvian cannibal tribe but really that's about it unless of course you are interested in home movies of a jewish wedding or schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers i give up big disappointment and not really a modern cannibal tale merk
<START> for me this movie was powerful i don't want to be a spoiler but i had a friend years ago we were like brothers this movie brought back some vivid memories br br for some reason i couldn't place my vote for this movie which would have been a 10 i kept getting a message like no votes have been placed and yet i saw in the stats that there were will try again tomorrow monday br br minor flaws i overlooked it was the relationships between the characters that got me beautifully acted and real situations i've been in a couple of them br br a small gem of a movie just like spring forward is another overlooked gem i'm very glad movies like these are still being made about relationships between people well written sensitively unfolded with first class acting and direction after all isn't that what it's all about
<START> trust me this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge denzel washington fan the frustrating part is that it's 1 3 of a great film the first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between creasy and the girl he's paid to protect the trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped so i'm giving nothing away when i say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after she's kidnapped whatever the director was trying to accomplish all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally nauseous rapid frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half hour as creasy tracks down the perpetrators these cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the story i'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in creasy's character and signified that a different movie was to follow well he was right the movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap the result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie
<START> the movie never claims to be something spectacular like many films do the films props itself as a fun and entertaining time and that's exactly what it was it is the korean version of a male bring it on br br from the get go you can feel for the rest of the film and how it will end but the enjoyment is not in the surprise twists nor is it the way the film is a carbon copy of another instead the enjoyment is held in the journey of how the 2 remaining thugs came to be men in their own right therefore the film is fun and entertaining br br the camera work specially the dolly moves were very well executed the script being a tad weak was overly enjoyable in the fact that the characters were not 2 dimensional but they were full of life and desire this film will not win any oscars nor any dvd blockbuster sales but a fun watch and a fun experience
<START> i went into this film with expectations from the hype that it would be insightful and uplifting certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band wilco br br instead we get a lot of moping and whining about the process a dishonorable and no doubt one sided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singer songwriter a gut wrenching confession by the fallen member's friend for like 18 years saying the friendship had run its course and this whiny uncompelling story about how one record label hurt their feelings by dumping them only so that the band could immediately get 50 offers from other labels oh the tension not they tried their best to make it look like it was a strain but i suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didn't exist this doesn't even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline insight or even a decent job at cinematography the strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch br br from the film this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they don't have and think they're some kind of guardians for the art of music which they most definitely are not and i thought the music sucked and i couldn't even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singer br br i give it a 2 10
