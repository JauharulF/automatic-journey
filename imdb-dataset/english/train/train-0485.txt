<START> this was a very good movie and is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account the time when it was released there are some movies which do not get older but this is clearly out of date however i saw this film when i was a boy and for more than twenty years both the images as the story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends until we could appreciate it again on dvd actually i do remember this movie as the topic of several chats and meetings where old boys were talking about things we have in common therefore there was a little feeling of disappoint and even sadness when we finally had the dvd firstly there was a theory about how naives our generation was secondly i think there is something more i would asset that this movie has something which should be interesting for all the modern film makers specifically those who focus on the decaying horror genre this is the mutilation the idea which gives coherence to the film the fact of a human being mutilated produces a deeper horror than death and torture i remember how sick the sensation was when the monster rip kurt's arm out and at the end when the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his veins another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere which prevails without decaying in intensity through all the scenes no matter if the action is on a secret lab a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body a striper dressing room and so on may be the reasons why it is not longer a good movie are just technical things for example in the scene of the accident and the man saving his fiancÃ©e's head a more accurate work made for another and modern second unit director could be interesting same thing with all action scenes including the one of kurt's arm furthermore something could be done with the monster's make up some remakes have been good i think in this case an attempt would worth while nevertheless the black and white tones should be conserved
<START> the title sequence shows the credits written on a rain soaked sidewalk as people trod on it music is provided by someone whistling alfred newman's street scene then we meet det sgt mark dixon dana andrews who always wanted to be something his old man wasn't a guy on the right side of the law but he's pretty vicious for a good guy after several complaints over his roughing people up his boss insp nicholas foley robert f simon demotes him foley tells him he's a good man but needs to get his head on straight and be more like det lt thomas karl malden who has just gotten a promotion br br meanwhile tommy scalise gary merrill in a splendidly slimy performance has an illegal dice game going and is looking to make a sucker out of the rich ted morrison harry von zell who was brought in by ken paine craig stevens and his beautiful wife morgan gene tierney she figures out too late her husband is using her as a decoy and paine strikes her when she refuses to play along the chivalrous morrison intervenes but paine knocks him out cold that seems to be the worst of it but later it turns out the guy is dead and paine looks guilty br br but this won't be paine's story soon dixon has fallen in love with morganÂbut not before losing his temper again and committing a terrible deed that he tries to cover up morgan's father a tale spinning taxi driver tom tully may take the rap for it it's up to dixon to try to pin the blame on scalise br br otto preminger directs a script credited to ben hecht and three others from the novel night cry by william l stuart this is a solid film noir with excellent performances and all the shadowy photography and murky morality we expect from this genre it holds up until the brightly lit ending which looks like something the studio had filmed to appease the censors of course the classic noir directed by preminger and starring andrews and tierney is laura you'll enjoy this but you can't miss that
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i saw it at the toronto film festival and totally regret wasting my time completely unwatchable with no redeeming qualities whatsoever br br steer clear
<START> there's hardly anything at all to recommend this movie chase masterson is always nice to look at and actually can act though her role in this clunker is a waste unfortunately the rest of the cast ranges from bad to mediocre in a lot of films like this someone will shine through the material and you make a note of them for future reference no such luck here creature unknown a clichÃ©d monster on the loose flick with the kids getting knocked off one after the other the monster is a man in a rubber suit which hearkens back to the days of paul blaisdell so bad it's good the rest of the show is just so bad it's bad a little humor might have made this more palatable but everyone plays the deadly dull material straight up there is a twist or two at the end but by then you won't care anymore
<START> i've seen mystery men cop a bit of stick in the press and with the general public take the imdb vote for instance but my overall feeling is that mystery men is more fun than most films definitely wittier than most so called comedy films and very nearly 'clever' br br the cast is superb greg kinnear is excellent as are geoffrey rush and tom waits kinnear's limo scene with ricky jay is perfect 'spoiled movie star' and he imbues his character with the right balance of comic book quality and realism to make him work br br i will admit the pacing is a little off in places and visuals are certainly very flash bang possibly to the detriment of further characterisation but at the end of the day this is high concept film making it's about the little moments what's up tiger lily and there are so many great ones in this film to make it worth repeated viewing
<START> bedknobs and broomsticks is a magical adventure film with a certain charm despite not being one of the best disney works it has a generally good story nice songs great characters good actors magical and delightful special effects good settings and lovely landscapes of england br br it also combines very well live action and animation the animation itself is of course pretty good the animation resembles very much that of the 1973 animated film robin hood and the same can be said about the animated characters there are plenty of wild animals such as bears elephants hippos lions crocodiles and others like in robin hood besides the king a lion seems to be a mix of prince john and king richard not to mention that the bear does look like little john br br this movie is often compared to mary poppins with a reason both combine live action and animation with a similar artwork both have similar settings in london both have their own magic and a magical woman the kids carrie charlie and cute little paul are a bit like the banks children both movies were directed by robert stevenson and both cast david tomlinson however instead of a very serious man like george banks david tomlinson plays a merrier and magical man professor emelius browne with its magic this movie has also some slight but significant similarities to harry potter's stories br br the majority of the songs are good the age of not believing and the beautiful briny sea are the very best portobello road is nice too br br david tomlinson is great in this film once again angela lansbury is great as miss price and the 3 kid actors are all fine too cindy o'callaghan as carrie ian weighill as charlie a boy in Â«the age of not believingÂ» and roy snart as the youngest brother paul br br i like the black cat it's pretty cool it looks a bit like salem the black cat from the tv series sabrina the teenage witch i find cute whenever one of the movie's characters is transformed into a white rabbit rabbits are really cute fluffy and adorable animals i just love them even funnier is whenever professor emelius browne is transformed into a white rabbit because when he's transformed in human again he shakes his nose like a rabbit it's really hilarious combined with his comical figure and that mustache br br overall this is an okay movie but its ending is quite bad the first minutes of the movie are nothing special but then it improves a lot the ending however is weak that's my major criticism about it in great part because the animated knights thing is a little too much for me and also due to the war feeling
<START> allen goes to the country somewhere he hates going in real life and has a weekend with his friends which are the usual successful white middle class bellyaching types that feature in many of his films br br i usually find something to amuse in woody allen comedies but here he really falls totally flat on his face even the one liners seem to have deserted him the really is no plot bar bits and pieces of cod shakespeare but allen seems to use the location to allow a semi mystical air which just makes the thing even more witless and half baked br br it just doesn't work at any level and is just a giant bore the best thing about this film apart from the end credits coming up is that the bad reviews seem to get him to wake up and realise that simply throwing together a slapdash script and casting your mates in it doesn't make for entertainment
<START> the only reason i watched the movie till the end was the hope to see something interesting the movie is really bad and the performance of the girl it is really really bad honestly i am not a movie critic neither an expert but you just need common sense to notice that this work it is incredibly bad br br the first thing that came to my mind as soon as she started to talk was she has an affair with willem dafoe and he accepted to help her with the screenplay and appear in her movie since she is the brilliant director surprise surprise next day after i watched the film i found out on internet that giada colagrande is his wife awful story and terrible performance
<START> just a warning this is the worst movie i have seen in years i couldn't watch it to the end it is a pure waste of time i really feel sorry for snipes that he ended up in such a movie there really is not much to say about it horrible acting incredibly bad lines story everything the only reason i would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn't be just to tell you one scene the police are searching for snipes and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars they are shooting around inside the building but still they are whispering so that snipes doesn't suspect a thing
<START> most italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie since because it has no connection to the first two demons films and with the demons iii in the title one would assume it would the problem is that this film was never intended to be part of the demons series the distributors only a demons iii above its original title the ogre to cash in on the other films popularity the new american dvd release of this picture has the title demons iii the ogre on the box art but the film itself only says the ogre i don't know if past releases had the title demons iii on the actual film itself but this new release just seems to be a little white lie if you can get past the demons iii in the title you might some enjoyment in the ogre it starts out with a creep intro and stays pretty creep throughout there's no gore and the film movies slowly but i still dug it just don't expect it to be like the other demons films i give the ogre 7 out of 10 italian fans should try it out
<START> this film has little to recommend it though that little being the breathtaking scenery cinematography and direction of wildlife it is difficult to bring up its weak points in the company of such rave reviews it is precisely these things however that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so disappointing br br i watched this with my children and none of us was too impressed by the end yes the pictures were great the broad landscapes across the forest and mountains magnificent but what was going on in the foreground the rather dull narration of the stupidity of an insipid girl who learns all too slowly a very basic lesson about befriending wildlife and gets off quite easily given the track record of that sort of thing it is certainly not a new story in fact there is nothing remotely novel about the way it is told and we have all seen this before and indeed much more eloquently by antoine de saint exupÃ©ry br br the only thing really to be gleaned from this film is a sense of how to work with these wonderful lenses and forest lighting the rest is a waste of time
<START> i saw heartland when it was first released in 1980 and i have just seen it again it improves with age heartland is not just for lovers of indie films at a time when most american films are little more than cynical attempts to make money with cgi pyrotechnics and or vulgarity heartland holds up as a slice of american history it is also a reminder of how spoiled most of us modern urbanized americans are br br nothing in this film is overstated or stagey no one declaims any hollywood movie speeches the actors really inhabit their roles this really feels like a small film but really it is bigger than most multizillion dollar hollywood productions br br the film is based on the lives of real people in 1910 elinore randall conchata ferrell who has never done anything better than this a widow with a 7 year old daughter jerrine megan folsom is living in denver but wants more opportunities she advertises for a position as housekeeper the ad is answered by clyde stewart rip torn one of our most under appreciated actors a scots born rancher himself a widower with a homestead outside of burnt fork wyoming elinore accepts the position seven dollars a week and moves up to wyoming with her daughter she and her daughter move into stewart's tiny house on the property it is rolling treeless rangeland a place of endless vistas where the silence is broken only by the sounds made by these people and their animals it's guaranteed to make a person feel small the three characters go for long periods without seeing another human soul what is worse stewart turns out to be taciturn to the point of being almost silent i can't talk to the man elinore complains to grandma landauer you'd better learn before winter replies grandma grandma lilia skala is one of the only two other characters who are seen more than fleetingly she came out to wyoming from germany with her husband many years before and runs her ranch alone now that she is also widowed grandma is their nearest neighbor and the local midwife and still she lives ten miles away the other supporting character is jack the hired hand barry primus br br elinore's routine and her employer's is one of endless backbreaking labor where there are no modern conveniences and where everything must be made fixed or done by hand this is the real meat of the film watching the ordinary life of these ranchers as they struggle against nature to wrest a living from the land but despite the constant toil and fatigue elinore is always looking for other opportunities she learns that the tract adjacent to stewart's is unclaimed impulsively she files a claim on the property twelve dollars or almost two weeks' pay meaning that if she lives on it and she must actually live there and works it for ten years she will get the deed to it naturally stewart learns what she has done with merciless logic he points out that with no money no livestock no credit and no assets she has no chance of succeeding he then offers a solution he proposes marriage the stunned elinore realizes that this is the only real alternative and accepts br br we think that stewart's proposal is purely machiavellian he wants the land and the free labor but we see that in fact he is genuinely fond of elinore and they grow together as a couple she becomes pregnant she goes into labor in the middle of a midwinter blizzard clyde travels for hours on horseback through the storm the ten miles to grandma's and the ten miles back only to announce that grandma wasn't there this is more like real life than is pleasant folks elinore has the baby all by herself with no help whatsoever their son is still an infant when he gets sick and dies they lose half their livestock to the vicious winter they struggle on the last sequence in the film is supposed to be optimistic the birth of a calf clyde calls elinore urgently to help him deliver the calf instead of being head first the calf is in a footling breech presentation he and elinore must physically pull the calf out of the birth canal there is no cgi animatronics trickery fakery or special effects what you see is what happened folks a calf is born on a bed of straw in a wooden barn by lamplight with that the film does not so much end as simply stop leaving the viewer unsatisfied but after a while you appreciate the film as a whole not just for its ending br br this little gem rewards patience and thoughtfulness it will be watchable long after most of the films of the last generation have long been forgotten
<START> for some reason in the late 70's and early 80's the local cbs affiliated station in new york kept playing this movie in it's late night slot on friday or saturday nights for several years usually at 2 a m or some such time it's a fitting movie for that time slot since it's really hard to follow and quite odd see the other reviews for specific story info anyway after catching it numerous times in those days just before cable tv and even after it hit but before they offered much all night programming i kept catching this little oddity after not seeing it for many years i decided to see if i could find it on dvd well it is only available from every search i've conducted anyway in a pretty lousy grainy print on the budget label brentwood video as part of a 4 pack of movies 4 movies on 2 double sided discs called alien worlds if anyone is interested it's usually available for around 10 but even much less if you shop around the other 3 movies on this set are readily available in numerous other collections of public domain movies so no need to comment on them here but i haven't seen eyes available anywhere else though hardly a restored version in any way this print runs exactly 92 minutes so for once imdb's stated running time of 90 minutes is not correct even with the 92 minute running time it's not unusual for a movie dubbed into english from another language to also have some of the running time trimmed it seems to be a common budget conscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important to the story would a longer version make in any less confusing who really knows unless you've seen it in it's native language by the way my attempts to watch this during the day don't work and i end up just turning it off there's something about watching this in the middle of the night that just fits this movie or maybe it's just from my earlier experiences who know
<START> series three blackadder the third if you want something done properly kill baldrick before you start hot on the heels of the second series the show returned with the current owner of the famous name down on his luck and in service as butler to the prince regent a vain and stupid foil for blackadders venom played by hugh laurie baldrick is still in tow as the other piece of the comedic jigsaw the format is similar to the previous show after all now they had found the winning formula why change things we see blackadder trying to get rich off of the back of the gullible regent in many more ingenious ways trying to make bladrick an m p or trying to woe a suitable bride for the prince in many ways this is one of the most accurate of the series historically the prince regent did take control of the throne during his fathers bout of madness and some of the characters lampooned tell a lot about the times samuel johnson william pit and wellington all pass through the events and all manage to steal their scenes not an easy thing with such a stellar cast
<START> the only thing remarkable about this movie is that all the actors could bomb at the same time idiocy i want my money back and i got it free from the library sheesh i would rather chew on tin fool and shave my head with a cheese grater then watch this again
<START> this isn't masterpiece theater you shouldn't go into it expecting that this is pure girl fun with the most fantastic cast of female leads like someone else here said this is the film baby mama was meant to be and the only downside i see to this film is that tina fey was not in it besides that it stars the smartest and brightest girls on the planet the film is pure silliness on the surface but if you really watch you will know it has a lot of messages and deep meaning to any of us who wish they could go back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know now pure fun and i recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape
<START> entertainment tonight has been going down hill for the last few years but as of last night aug 17th 2006 they reached a new low br br in an effort to try to hype up their broadcast they decided to post actual photos of jonbenet ramsey's body in their teasers last night saying pictures from the case you have never seen before the two photos were graphic and very disturbing one was of the side of her face and head neck and you could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her around her neck and bruising on her face this was so hideously awful i could not believe it how has this got to do with anything remotely related to hollywood entertainment nothing they have dropped their level of dignity and values to a new low and it shows this used to be the premiere show to watch and it's just garbage now br br i will watch access hollywood from now on
<START> when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichÃ©s that you can guarantee will follow br br 1 the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens what who how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst 2 the van will break down 3 whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about 4 they will find a house inhabited by a madman he will capture them 5 the house will have a phone but it will not work it will be disturbingly decorated there will be flickering neon light spiders and maggots 6 the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won't start here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor 7 the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap weak scare and will then be killed properly 8 only a girl will be left alive from the group 9 there will be an unnecessary twist at the end br br add to these elements naked sirens who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately that seduce and kill the teens throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie br br i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film darkhunters which is one of the worst films i have ever seen at times the cinematography is very good the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity however the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again but amongst the dvd extras br br if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director's commentary it is beyond belief there is more to say about this than the film itself one staggering part of the commentary is the director's claim that the film is clichÃ© leaden because it was a preconceived idea he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichÃ©s and openly he wonders if people will get it br br i'm afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichÃ©s within them then it is not wittily scripted enough acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question what was the point this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies any attempt to do something clever or different haven't worked br br the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use however the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary there is a simple distinction to be made here mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant br br the best moment is reserved for robert's comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film those who didn't like it are generalised as 'geeks' and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn't singled out for ridicule the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers complete with 'hilarious' accents to imply that people from norway wouldn't know a good film simply because of where they are born as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant br br the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast robert's swears blind in voice over 'i didn't want to make a film that was like baywatch' as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground there is also a simpering self indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert's says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is the best british film in years i don't know who he is trying to convince at one point in the commentary track robert's says jokingly i can see people sitting at home saying this isn't amazing its sh t he isn't wrong
