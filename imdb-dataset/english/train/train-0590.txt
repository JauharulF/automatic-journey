<START> it's been nearly 30 years and i still hate everyone involved in this movie it remains the worst movie i've ever seen br br before seeing this i never much minded rivers one way or the other after seeing this movie i have an allergic reaction when i accidentally see her on television br br i got dragged to this against my better judgment by peer pressure however coming out of the theater those friends swore an oath to never again overrule my choice of movie nearly thirty years later we still carry around mental scars from this movie br br on my deathbed one of my regrets will be the time i wasted hoping that this movie might get better it never did br br if you are ever given a choice you would prefer putting your own eyes out to sitting though this movie br br i registered for imdb comments just in the hope that perhaps i can warn others against viewing this movie if i can save just one person from watching this then my existence on this earth will have been justified
<START> skip mccoy richard widmark pick pockets candy's jean peters wallet which contains an important microfiche that is intended for the communist cause she is being followed by 2 federal agents that are waiting to pounce once she hands the microfiche over to her contact however skip steals the purse on the subway under everyone's noses and so starts a hunt for him by both the police and joey richard kiley and candy who want the microfiche back skip can only be traced through moe thelma ritter who sells information on criminals it is made clear to skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film but he intends to hold out for a high price this leads to joey hunting after him and a conflict between joey and jean who has fallen in love with skip joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss br br its a well acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away its a bit unrealistic how jean peters immediately falls in love with widmark but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from joey its a good film
<START> the sequel to the ever popular cinderella story reminded me somewhat of what they did with one of the beauty the beast movies it's basically three short stories rolled into 1 br br ok the mice are adorable i love gus he's sooo cute and lucifer's awesome as usual i liked some of the newer characters as well pom pom was adorable and i did like prudence still the storyline was somewhat limited but still very cute so i vote 7 10
<START> this has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an austen novel although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular pride and prejudice emma is a lush and relatively faithful tv version of austen's novel especially considering its short length the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one as the unnecessary snobbishness that austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to emma's character in the rest of the book i thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well picked kate beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in gwyneth paltrow's '96 version samantha morton's wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the harriet we know from the book mister knightly's role is carried out extremely well in my opinion both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much neglected sumptuous film
<START> never cast models and playboy bunnies in your films bob fosse's star 80 about dorothy stratten of whom bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her sister after her murder at the hands of her low life husband is a zillion times more interesting than dorothy herself on the silver screen patty hansen is no actress either i expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la orson welles but instead got audrey hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god awful poodlesque hair do very disappointing paper moon and the last picture show i could watch again and again this clunker i could barely sit through once this movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding ms stratten's tawdry death i think the real reason was because it was so bad
<START> haha you have to just smile and smile if you actually made it all the way through this movie it like says something about myself i guess the movie itself was created i think as some sort of psychological test or like some sort of drug to take you to a place you have never been before when wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece the tractacus sp he said it was meaningless and useless but if you read it after you were done it would take you to a new level like a ladder and then you could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding this movie is the same i think br br as a movie it is without a doubt the worst movie i have seen in a long long time in such a unique way first of all this is snipes i loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies and i have suffered through a few weak ones however although you know the movie might suck you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it actually was which is the fun of it i mean this is snipes you know it might be good but it will be alright right smile br br so this thing on every level is pure boredom pure unoriginality the reference to the professional is both dead on and obvious yet so poorly done as to be comical there is not one character in this movie that is interesting in the least and to make the whole thing more surreal they have a soundtrack that sort of sounds like parts to various bourne identity type movies only isn't quite right in fact although it seems close to action movie background music it just so happens it is done in a manner that will grate on you fantastically br br then all the scenes in the total pitch black where honestly since the characters are so flat you don't really care whats going to happen but regardless after it happens and someone is killed you just say to yourself was i supposed to see that what else how about scenes with blinding obnoxious flashing at a strobe lights pace for a period of time that is too long to bear sure let's throw that in how bout this though when you are straining and your eyes cant handle it any longer do some more of these in the dark kills where you really don't see what happened and on top of that lets face it you don't care you were past bored way from the beginning br br so i drifted in and out a couple times but i caught almost all of this movie and it becomes something you can watch without something that engages your mind on any level therefore it becomes something you can effectively zone out with and begin to think about your life where its going where its been what we are as people br br and that that is the true magic of this film
<START> despite the lack of logic present in the storyline kill shot is a highly enjoyable film through a moving performance kasper van dien brilliantly portrays the emotional rift between a hard working wealthy father and his misguided son each member of the supporting cast pitches in with a solid performance highlighted by the vivid acting of a young asian man whose name i cannot recall a shockingly tragic ending may unnerve some younger viewers but as a whole kill shot truly delivers a death blow
<START> what a great word re imagining is isn't that what they call dawn of the dead mmiv 2004 a clever word indeed it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate remake that is and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination well damn was i misled at least i was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of re imagining though it played a role br br still why make a remake directors do it for only a few reasons really to update a movie for a modern audience or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it an homage if you will nonetheless it all generally i do admit exceptions boils down to one thing stealing someone's idea and reshaping it or re imagining it so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it it's like coles' cliffs' notes dump everything in a blender purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors in other words a great marketing scheme br br so what's wrong with this one well i'll start with what i liked i liked the opening scenes thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means we see the city in ruins thousands of zombies chaos and death two words that look beautiful on screen then it all falls apart br br this set up leads nowhere the movie does what almost every remake does it adds more of everything except character atmosphere and story it's noisier in some sense bloodier and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots the setting the mall which played a crucial role in the original film's story and theme is purely coincidental the idea communicated in romero's film the pure ecstatic joy of having a mall all to yourself as a fortress is gone here further this re imagining has no moxie no spirit no balls it assumes probably quite rightly that the audience has no attention span and doesn't bother to get us interested in the characters or the story the film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original you actually grew to care about those people in romero's version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall here you don't care when or who goes what matters is how they go br br what else is their to say the film is not scary it has one or two jump scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects as a story it's really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it the humor is also reduced to a few one liners and one really good character andy after that what remains an ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued inevitable ambiguity of the original film but despite it being a pretty bad film though not quite as bad as some other remakes it should be remembered for one thing it kicked the passion of christ from it's number one spot in the box office well done zombies
<START> this really is the most dreadful film i have ever seen i simply have no idea how anyone has the audacity to put this on release br br the production standards are atrocious there is no pretence here at cinematography the camera work scripting acting and sound are unbelievably crass i think there is a plot but it could have been done in 10 minutes sparing us the time to watch it the hysterical neurotic girls at the centre of this piece have no credibility whatsoever br br i would urge anyone to avoid spending any time or money on this title it is truly atrocious br br jdd 14 december 2008
<START> i also viewed this film at the santa barbara film festival it was an excellent film about adult family relationships paul reiser wrote the film and included some similarities to his family it was funny warm poignant and moving as well as entertaining a film like this would do very well with the word of mouth reviews i would definitely tell my friends and family to see this film let's only hope they'll have the chance i would rate this film as one of the best movies i've seen in a year it contains no violence action scenes murders sex so evidently distributors question whether or not to pick it up believe me there are people out there who would love to go see a movie like this that has redeeming value instead of the many typical big box office blockbusters we are usually given
<START> absolutely hilarious john waters' tribute to the people he loves most baltimoreans is a twisted little ditty with plenty to look at and laugh at it's like being turned loose in a museum of kitsch i haven't laughed so much in a theater since serial mom i loved seeing old friends from the dreamland days sharon nisep and susan lowe back in front of waters' camera the cast is simply wonderful especially edward furlong and martha plimpton uses the best elements of past waters atrocities especially the underrated polyester and plenty of new surprises made me sick in a wonderful way thanks john
<START> what else is left to say br br i've read all the reviews here and most are right on however one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan tainted it or something along those lines evil wow what a shocker i mean tbn basically made this film open your eyes please br br anway this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in years br br the most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they spent to make it if this movie can be made there are no limits and therefore we have no choice but to get ready for yentl 2 and ernest loses the omega codes br br for those of you who are into the biblical stories the new movie dogma will pickup where omega code never started
<START> i've read up a little bit on che before watching this film and you wanna know something he was a real hero for the people because he only wanted to see equality for everyone and that he hated what the oppressive forces were doing to his people as well as all other latin americans in general now i don't know about others but to me he did the right thing by wanting socialism so that everyone had to pay their fair share however the powerful elite obviously weren't going to go for that so rather than understanding what che guevera wanted they were forced to kill him in attempting to suppress the revolution it didn't work since there were too many of his other followers who only picked up where he left off a good example of this was when castro continued his leadership in cuba as far as i'm concerned and as che said it himself right before he died if you kill me that's fine but you're only killing a man you'll never kill the cause i couldn't have said it any better myself br br but anyways that's why i give this film a 7 out of 10
<START> bunny comes home 'this man's navy' deserves more credit than it gets a clever script by borden chase directed by 'wild bill' wellman the film has just the right feel for early post ww11 euphoria and goodwill and none of the blind terror that came into play few years later produced in 1944 the japanese defeated the battle scenes a little dÃ©jÃ  vu tom drake's melancholy attraction for radiant young jan clayton has solid chemistry plays real and validates drake's career at metro the following year jan opened on broadway in 'carousel ' wally beery a little bleary eyed boasts to an always incredulous jimmy gleasonÂ his memories an improvement over reality and give beery a ulysses like shadow to play against the navy lta lighter than air shots are authentic photographed at tustin and lakehurst and the p 38 squadron is out of march afb lot 3 doubled for india and bunny's u turnÂ bunny comes homeÂ gives back to beery an authentic slice of his past something he had wanted to believe was trueÂ then the future we spin into again is fantasticalÂ now on a grander scale a newly designed navy lta with launch capabilities for a reconnaissance planeÂ how expensive blissfully optimisticÂ still you got to believe in it that's the way you make things come trueÂ
<START> images are great and reflect well the landscapes of canada the story was on the other side quite boring to my eyes it was a love story in the woods just like titanic was a love story on a boat i did not feel that grey owl was great environmentalist i usually like lord attenborough but this one was bad
<START> shame really very rarely do i watch a film and am left feeling disappointed at the end i've seen quite a few of ira levin's adaptations 'rosemary's baby' and 'the stepford wives' and liked both them but this just didn't appeal to me br br when i read the plot outline an award winning playwright michael caine decides to murder one of his former pupils christopher reeve and steel his script for his own success i was excited i like thrillers michael caine's a good actor sidney lumet's a good director and ira levin's work is generally good br br i won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet but all i'd say is there are loads of twists and turns so many its kind of hard to explain the film's plot line in detail without giving it away i enjoyed the first 45 minutes before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out though i have to give lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out loud br br the main cast michael caine christopher reeve dyan cannon and irene worth were all brilliant in their roles though worth's obvious fake russian accent got on my nerves slightly nothing personal irene i think any actor's fake accent would irritate me not sure if cannon's character was meant to be annoyingly funny but dyan managed to annoy and amuse at the same time br br anyone reading this i don't want you to be put off watching this because of my views give it a chance you may like it you may not it's all about opinion
<START> in the opening scene of malta story mr a guinness bore such a startling resemblance to noel coward that i fully expected his first words to be certain women need striking regularly like gongs or some such world weary bon mot unfortunately his dialogue is hardly deathless prose and even the master would have had trouble bringing it to life indeed mr guinness wanders through the picture as if looking for a focal point and failing to find one and therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie mr j hawkins likewise gives up early on and ends up giving a jack hawkins performance without an ounce of individuality it could have been spliced from any of a dozen british war movies many of the early fifties usual suspects turn up and do their schtick to very little purpose the luftwaffe failed to bomb malta into submission in much the same way as it failed to bring london to its knees the courage of the maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognised by the king and the island was awarded the george cross a worthy subject you might think for a movie but malta story does not even qualify for the term worthy in its most patronising sense it gives the appearance of being hastily cobbled together to meet a deadline perhaps before the actors lost the will to live
<START> let's face it romantic comedies are considered lightweight when compared with dramatic movies just look at the academy award nominations each year but still the good ones are truly an art form look at when harry met sally sleepless in seattle and classics like roman holiday and it happened one night i like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness br br this movie attempts to construct something that resembles a romantic comedy but no one believes the romance between the main characters and there is nothing funny to make up for that major shortcoming modine is way past being a leading man especially a romantic lead i'm sure as executive producer he had the means but not the good sense to cast himself and gershon i see possibilities of some comedic talent but she had no script and a poorly developed character and whose idea was the english accent pointless br br others have stated it but i want to repeat this story is poorly conceived poorly executed the actors are terribly miscast and the characters well we just don't give a hoot about them br br an art form this ain't go rent moonstruck again
<START> david mamet's film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinking man's movie a movie that makes you question everybody and everything i saw it for the first time recently and couldn't understand what was supposed to be so great about it br br the movie is about a female psychologist named margaret who is also a best selling author margaret has become disillusioned by her profession and her inability to really help anyone she tries to rectify this by helping settle her patient's gambling debt to a shark named mike played by joe mantegna who is the only reason to watch this film she discovers that mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a scam he pulls immediately after meeting her intrigued she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book she then falls for him and accompanies him on a long con that he and his associates have set up br br i don't feel like going into details but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by mike and his cronies to swindle margaret out of 80 000 br br first of all the big twist towards the end was very predictable any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the stagey acting and weird line reads not only that but the audience and the main character knows that they're dealing with con men so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that margaret has herself been conned besides margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people yet she allows herself to be duped far too easily and keep in mind she knows full well that mike is a con artist br br secondly we are led to believe that margaret was conned from the very beginning yet in order for the con to ultimately work she had to do several things that the con men couldn't possibly have predicted that she would do first she had to decide to help settle her patient's debt allowing her to meet the con men in the first place if she hadn't done this the entire con would have failed i just have to say that it's pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a patient's gambling debt not only that but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up did they simply show up at that bar every night hoping she would come and see them another thing that had to happen that couldn't have been predicted is that margaret had to return to see mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade what are the odds of this happening and yet the whole con is based on this premise br br another problem i had is with the ending margaret finds out she's been conned and decides to get revenge on mike at first mamet leads us to believe that she's going to con the con but that falls through so the ultimate ending is her gunning mike down in an airport baggage area somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists plying their trade not only that but she didn't even take back the money he stole from her br br ultimately the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled and if you like me predicted ahead of time that margaret was going to be conned you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying
<START> the movie is great like every other international project that includes strong impressions three of them israel bosnia and egypt should've been cut out especially bosnian clip which is pathetic beyond all reason and doesn't contain a single original thought or element on it's own everything else is really great unrecognizable for most of americans known for the rest of the world unfortunately clips speak about misery of the people all over the world and as i see it there are so many of those who won't give a damn about it br br top 5 1 loach 2 penn 3 inarritu 4 lalouche 5 imamura
