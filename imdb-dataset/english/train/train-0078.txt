<START> this film made for french tv deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family when leo the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the aids virus announces it to his parents they just can't believe it the film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject br br the director christophe honore has to be congratulated for bringing this frank account to the screen nowhere but in france could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter br br the news has a devastating effect on marcel the young brother who hears about what leo has contracted in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality br br yaniss lespart and pierre mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers
<START> i couldn't make sense of this film much of the time and neither could anyone else based on other reviews the opening scene of this film has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the story in it a photojournalist with a big mustache cancels his vacation to get away from his girlfriend he is assigned to photograph a mountain range it's rumored to be haunted but i couldn't tell whether he heard that from his boss or later in the film on his way he meets a beautiful writer patty shepard and convinces her to join him on his working trip throughout the film there is this terrible music score mostly consisting of noisy singing that makes you want to scream shut up already what really will gall a person is that the film always seems like it's about to become good though it never does there is beautiful mountain scenery and some genuinely creepy atmosphere the inn and the silent abandoned old buildings scattered on the mountain are rather ominous the foggy nights look real not like someone put an artificial fog machine on the set and the idea while not original had potential but it never does improve at least not enough to be worthwhile here's how it goes more or less they stop at this inn run by a weird innkeeper you expect him to be named igor with a hearing problem there is a scene where the writer thinks a peeping tom is in her window but the scene is so dark i had no idea what was going on whether this was poor lighting or a poor film transfer is unknown to me in any event we never find out know what happened there is a scene where she wanders off during the night whether she is sleepwalking or mesmerized by the witches of the title is never explained another scene which is never explained is when their car is stolen then found again with nothing stolen they wind up in this apparently abandoned mountain village whose sole inhabitant is this seemingly kindly old woman there are other things including a chained wild man in a cave who is never explained an attempt to sacrifice the writer in some way will they kill her or brainwash her into joining them the witches themselves a bunch of brunette women in white robes who don't show up until the last 15 minutes of the film and whose practices and beliefs are never explained even the closing scene doesn't make any sense when all is said and done most people will be saying huh
<START> national lampoon goes to the movies 1981 is simply put the worst movie ever made far lamer than even the inept plan 9 from outer space br br the lampoon film is told in three segments each one supposedly a spoof of a conventional movie genre but each one landing at our feet with a sickening thud there is no rhyme or reason for these execrable vignettes and no discernible story lines br br another reviewer on this site has written that the only good points about the film are the nude scenes true misses ganzel and dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh and very nice it is too but the directors seem not to realize that even t a needs a good story to surround it there's none of that here br br probably the worst of the three segments is the last one featuring robby benson and richard widmark here we see benson as a young eager beaver policeman being paired with a cynical oldtimer played by widmark and for just a moment those of us who are still watching this odious cinematic exercise are heartened by the thought that we are about to see a redemptive tale about how the young idealistic cop brings about a purifying change in the old timer's approach to police work but no such luck as we've said this film has no redeeming values it is sickening all the way to the final fade out which perversely is stretched out longer than it should last on the screen apparently the film makers knew they had a bad thing going and wanted to make the least of it
<START> rodney dangerfield is a great he has done a lot of great works but this one is awful the whole plot is whack it could have been much better the jokes in the movie aren't funny their stupid this was very not so hilarious he can do much better than this
<START> i love this show mr blick gordon and waffle are cats so different from each other yet they refer to themselves collectively as 'brothers ' i often find myself trying to imitate the tired sighing accent of their butler hovis or even the scottish borough of gordon there should be more episodes made about human kimberly the episode about the cats disguising themselves as pre teen girls to gain admittance to human kimberly's slumber party in order to get their thirsty paws on their favorite drink rootbeer is a hilarious classic we can't drink rootbeer in our house now without either doing the catscratch voices or the hanson brothers from the movie 'slap shot ' future classic where can i get the first two seasons on dvd
<START> the only reason i give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are few movies in my opinion that are perfect this little b picture is a taut story well told i've always been intrigued by alexander knox but have seen him very few movies here he plays wilhelm grimm a sad little man who turns into a monster he betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse the performance is one of the most chilling performances i've ever seen since world war 2 actors who played nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for oscars i imagine that since this was made during the war the academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil but knox puts in that kind of performance a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer i still can't get over it br br marsha hunt who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly is cast against type in probably the best performance i've ever seen her give too maybe not oscar worthy but the best of her career nothing against her i have enjoyed her in those slight roles she often played but here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama br br if you like human drama stories or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis i highly recommend this fine little film
<START> i happen to run into this movie one night so i decided to watch it i was very pleased with the movie i thought it was a wonderful plot it's a great feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say and this wife stayed devoted for 23 years i thought it was a great movie
<START> after viewing several episodes of this series i have come to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality here is an old science fiction standby ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept and still they can only almost make it work br br the dialog is good the male actors are reasonably proficient at their professions most of the characters are well drawn with special kudos to the hero and his more than likeable side kick and most of the episode plots come across as palatable so what could be wrong how about the the female characters and the cosmeticly perfect actresses who are chosen to portray them br br the producers insist on portraying the female characters in this almost good series in a manner that makes the end product appear to be a misplaced cheerleader why i ask why br br the episodes all fall flat whenever the female guest star or recurring character comes on screen these actresses are all totally unbelievable in their roles and you don't actually have to see them to know they are incapable of their acting assignments a blind person could tell just listen to them talk they deliver their dialog with all the drama and effect of a 16 year old at the high school prom who would believe these women are phd scientist senators corporate executives and medical doctors br br in a nut shell if the producers have their choice of a stockard channing or a morgan fairchild guess who they'll choose every time and of course the series suffers for it too bad
<START> i wasn't as lucky as some of the others commenting on this film i have never seen anything else out of the shall we say fecund mind of sarno i agree with many some of the actresses who spend a lot of time topless and go go dancing are not really that attractive i kinda liked fraulein crank she was so homely she was cute the acting was pretty stale also though delivering lines in a second language might have accounted for a lot of that problem trying to follow the plot was a major chore was there one really i do heartily agree with one other comment for a vampire movie there's not much blood yep if you want good bloodsucking flicks check out such hammer classics as horror of dracula and my personal favourite brides of dracula br br the most unintentionally humorous part is where the lady doctor gets her clothes torn off by a cloud of bats which you never see the bats i mean br br okay as a time waster if you happen to catch it on cable here in the great white north but for heaven's sake don't rent it
<START> this movie masquerades as a social commentary when in fact it is every bit as ridiculous as the very racism it condemns the premise of this movie african american strong any other race weak the worst part is when rapaport pulls a gun on omar epps and a jewish guy the jewish guy in stereotypical fashion crumbles in fear and starts pleading for his life but the big strong defiant omar epps stands strong with no fear we also have the condemnation of every fraternity member as being a arrogant preppie drunk or rapist the raped white girl of course begins considering lesbianism since she's just a weak white girl after all when the nerdy white guy is rejected by the fraternity members he of course must fall in with the skinheads who are incredible cowards especially the big muscular guy who is beaten down quickly by the strong black men wait busta rhymes beat up a guy twice his size yeah right br br of course the black men never reject their own people and omar epps moves in with them easily the scenes where ice cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are just stupid of course he is the dominating one while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually move out this movie was just terrible and the ending made me actually laugh out loud the overly long slow motion between epps and banks gets hilarious with the faces they make it's like watching my nephew and cousins making faces at each other and they're all under 5 do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest
<START> kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode they intend to evacuate the inhabitants but find the place deserted except for a mr atoz who operates some sort of high tech library despite trying to get a straight answer from him about everyone's whereabouts atoz is indifferent to their questions and insist they must quickly 'make a selection while there is still time' they have no idea what he's talking about but wander about looking at the hand mirror like disks on the viewers and they see images of the planet's past then while a disk is in the viewer kirk runs through the doorway and is magically transported back in time to what on earth would look like the time of louis xiv the 1660s when mccoy and spock follow a different disk is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell all too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository br br while kirk's visit is pretty short and not all that exciting spock and mccoy's is much more eventful as spock falls head over heels for mariette hartley who was sent to this awful place as a punishment the scenes with spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical of the normally logical guy br br spock's departure from the norm the wildly inventive script and very diverse locales make this an exceptional episode one well worth seeing br br fyi ian wolfe the excellent character actor played mr atoz i am a huge fan of older films and have seen him as a supporting and bit player in countless films in the 30s and 40s and he looked almost exactly like he did in this episode from 1969 interestingly enough despite looking ancient he lived on another 23 years dying at over 95 years of age
<START> someone has already mentioned being at the right time at the right place it was so true for this documentary that i had doubts about the genuineness of the scenes and thought it included perhaps some acting but it is not it is all real the story is nothing new for the people of the developing and or poor countries it sheds light on the manipulation of the people by corporate media the misinformation the artificial polarization of the people by deliberately creating tension on the streets sometimes to the point that the army intelligence agency or even the government many believe led by the us uses agents who attack any side to provoke the masses into violence and therefore justifying their coups a marine officer in the film mentions this also that they wanted to see the peoples confront on the streets all of these scenarios have been played in turkey usa's pet dog in the middle east throughout its history who has experienced 3 coups and lately secret plans made by the turkish army have been exposed ironically through a pro government religious conservative media opposing the a religious doctrines of the army in which a very important mosque is bombed by an army agent to provoke the people etc br br what makes this film unique is that they were filming from inside perhaps by chance when the events have happened it is clear that the directors are pro chavez whether or not this caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and the information i would not know br br and whether chavez will be defending the people of venezuela against the dictatorship of us and the global economy without repressing any opposing thought with force and in the end becoming a self indulgent tyrant history will tell br br but at least chavez is hope and i believe it is worth taking the chance
<START> i think this is what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie or damn australian i still don't know but what i know is that i really liked this movie but that couldn't be my favorite movie br br great story with great actors but with a terrible end to make you cry and say 'oh she's so good' still who made it what really happened who's that guy no answer to these questions br br mysterious movie with a good mark overall i give it a 8 10 going on the 8 5
<START> this belgian film directed by tom barman singer of the well known group deus will not be favoured by everyone for the simple reason that there isn't a clear story or even a plot this movie just shows 24 hours in a city here antwerp and allows you to watch and truly enjoy the dialogues the directing the humorous dario the osteopath bruno and tragic windman paul garcin characters br br there are several memorable scenes the windman on the beach the dance party at the end the kiss fan windman visits the osteopath br br clearly some other viewers didn't understand what's so beautiful and interesting in this movie they complain that this movie has no story etc but it's the atmosphere that keeps you watching and that will drag you into it br br if you didn't watch it yet be sure to listen carefully to the music the soundtrack is extraordinary just like tom barman and his group deus br br and ssst mondje dicht hÃ© don't tell anyone
<START> in this glorious telling of a weekend shared among literary greats mary and percy shelly lord byron and others created a entrancing group showing their quests for sexual enlightenment personal freedoms from political to moral liberal drug use for both stimulations and as addiction their creative views of life and writing describing without boring the viewer how each writer seeks to find their muse along with the distractions and affections each share with breathtaking scenery that does not detract but very much enhances the story well created characters from grim to loving then angry to peaceful with some of the most lovely and scene enhancing costuming to be had
<START> the orders fatal flaw besides an asinine plot is that the character's simply don't resonate or even react br br two examples a priest walking through a graveyard late at night is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits after fighting them off he calmly resumes his walk when his buddy come up anything wrong his buddy asks having seen the attack just some demonic spirits nothing i couldn't handle no reaction no surprise just like he'd changed a tire his buddy is equally unconcerned must be standard priest training and then you put the wafer into their mouths any questions ok moving on demon spirit attacks br br example two at one point the priests need an answer to a question and only a demon or something who cared by now could provide it how why you have to ask a dying man so the demon has some random person hung in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the thrashing gasping man hey don't kill him or maybe that's not nice would have been more realistic then their response they never ask that they let the man go or stop in fact the closest to reacting they get is mild annoyance they ask their question and go br br i had to shut it off at that point my brain was starting to atrophy br br avoid br br one star out of four br br
<START> the plot of 7eventy 5ive involves college kids who play a cruel phone game that unexpectedly to them if not to fans of horror gets them in over their heads the story of 7eventy 5ive on the other hand is that of a horror film that had a wee little bit of promise sadly outweighed by really bad writing br br what could have been a fun if somewhat silly old fashioned slasher tale is derailed early on by its filmmakers' misguided belief that the audience would enjoy watching a bunch of loud whiny rich kids bitching at each other for most of the film's running time with the exception of a police detective played by rutger hauer in a minor role that is designed mainly to add the movie's only star power every character on screen is a different breed of young a hole br br male and female black and white straight and gay an entire ensemble of shallow and shrill college kids carries the bulk of the film's narrative worse since the tale deals with a party game gone awry most of the time the scenes are completely filled with these little b ds because of this there are few breaks for the viewer who must put up with the angry sniping of the thinly drawn protagonists even though at least some of these people are supposedly friends invariably all characters interact in a very hostile manner long before any genuine conflict has actually arisen this leads to the worst possible result in a slasher film the audience intended to care about the leads instead not only cheers on the anonymous killer but wishes that he had arrived to start picking off the vacuous brats far earlier br br the real shame of this poor characterization is that otherwise 7eventy 5ive actually did have some potential visually it's fine first time directors brian hooks and deon taylor know how to build a suspenseful mood they also manage to deliver on some competent if sparse moments of classic 80s style gore surprisingly the production's cast is also fairly able it isn't that the actors aren't capable of expressing realistic human emotion it is simply that the screenplay co written by newcomer vashon nutt and director hooks who fared much better behind the camera than with a keyboard is short of such moments br br 7eventy 5ive can hardly be recommended as its familiar premise and few thrills can't outweigh the bad taste left behind by a story driven by a gaggle of unpleasant characters in this tepid whodunnit the real mystery is why anyone should care about a group of young folk who can't even manage to like each other
<START> welcome to our town welcome to your town as we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of 1901 america this three act play is opened before us with the help of the stage manager a visual narrator if you like after his initial introductions we are lead into the homes of two particular families the webb's and the gibb's br br this is most definitely middle america at the turn of the century and the progressive way of life of the american dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of grover's corners new hampshire even if there are too the migrant polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers they never get a look in br br once the daily lives of these families have been introduced wives cooking children home working fathers working kids falling in love and the clean picket fences painted white the second act is started three years later after young george a young and unrecognisable william holden then aged 22 and emily have fallen in love and intend to marry blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching too a turning point in their own lives from the nest they lived and now into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step the third act is slightly more sour and foreboding it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent here we see not life not celebration but death and it is in this predicament that the dead as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past are here to remind us to tell us that life and every last minute every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered br br it is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on and by middle america and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order this isn't just about our town this is moral diction aimed at our souls and how america can better itself if its peoples' excluding the poles the irish the native american and the freed ethnic minorities' and minorities' in general plus the supporting backbone of the americana's who still have not had a fair part in this narrative such as the middle classes can live up to the expectations of the american dream through honest decent living the purveyors of the american dream with special invitation only br br i was entertained slightly by this movie too but i felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting the musical score or how well or not it was made this was the movies intention to exclude other groups and to only include the likes of the webb's and the gibb's in the future of the developing country of the usa a good movie but also a slightly biased in its stance i thought br br taken from the play by us' born thornton wilder 1897 1975 this pulitzer prize winning play and six academy award nominated movie was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes life love and death the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness our town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness like other towns nothing too exciting ever happens here if anything at all this town only has the right sort of people you can still leave your back door unlocked here we are seeing the developing lives of these two families but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves our town may just have been any town just as long as you came from the right part of town that is
<START> watching ossessione today more than 6 decades later is still a powerful experience especially for those interested in movie history and more specifically on how italian filmmakers changed movies forever roughly from ossessione and de sica's i bambini ci guardano both 1943 up to 20 years later with fellini antonioni pasolini visconti makes an amazing directing dÃ©but taking the uncredited plot of the postman always rings twice as a guide to the development of his own themes br br it strikes us even today how ahead of its time ossessione was shot in fascist italy during world war ii think about it it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters and the fact that it used the plot of a famous american novel and payed no copyright didn't help br br ossessione alarmingly reveals poverty ridden war time italy far from the idealized italy depicted in fascist telefoni bianchi movies but it's also extremely daring in its sexual frankness with shirtless hunk gino massimo girotti who definitely precedes brando's kowalski in a streetcar named desire taking giovanna clara calamai a married woman to bed just 5 minutes after they first meet we watch calamai's unglamorous matter of fact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between gino and lo spagnolo elio marcuzzo a very appealing actor his face not unlike pierre clÃ©menti's who was shot by the nazis in 1945 at 28 years old in a few words sex lust greed and poverty as relentlessly as it had rarely if ever been shown before in italian cinema br br all the copies of ossessione were destroyed soon after its opening it was called scandalous and immoral visconti managed to save a print and when the film was re released after the war most critics called it the front runner of the neo realist movement preceding rossellini's roma cittÃ  aperta and de sica's sciusciÃ  some other critics perhaps more appropriately saw ossessione as the italian counterpart to the poetic realism of french cinema remember visconti had been renoir's assistant especially marcel carnÃ©'s quai des brumes and le jour se lÃ¨ve and julien duvivier's pÃ©pÃ© le moko br br while ossessione may be neo realistic in its visual language the depiction of war time paesan life in italy with its popular fairs poverty child labor prostitution bums swindlers etc the characters and the themes were already decidedly viscontian he was always more interested in tragic passionate obsessive greedy characters in social political sexual apartheid in the decadence of the elites than in realistic everyday life characters and themes favored by desica and rossellini in ossessione we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films especially senso visconti's definitive departure from neo realist aesthetics and rocco e suoi fratelli even in his most neo realist film la terra trema he makes his fishermen rise from day to day characters to mythological figures br br ossessione is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again from their first to their last opus no matter if the scenery background or time setting may change visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are well obsessively recurrent ossessione is not to be missed you'll surely be fascinated by this ground breaking powerful film
<START> liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early 18th century he is a true actor he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary mary is such a beautiful woman it's her love that makes rob roy the legend but it's his passion that makes her love undying they need each other tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect in one way or another upon watching the movie you will find cunningham disgusting the scotland scenery is beautiful the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well if you like history romance passion and love you'll enjoy rob roy there is violence and blood but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told no gratuitous violence and you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a scottish accent one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes it's their skill as actors that attracts you they don't rely on marquee names popularity or sex symbol appeal this is something special
