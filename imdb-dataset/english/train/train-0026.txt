<START> this was one of the best war movies i've seen because it focuses on the characters more then the actual war all of the cast do an excellent job and because most of them are relative unknowns it makes everything seem more believable the camera footage is great is so was the pacing and editing this movie will actually get to you and causes the audience to care for the charcters
<START> when i learned of sir alec guinness' death this was the first of his many films i thought of re seeing what a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years and guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame his eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites
<START> this film actually manages to be mindless enjoyment for 2 3 of the journey sadly the film ends up being too 'confused ' while i know some of the plot contrivances are standard of 'buddy cop' films i got drawn in to the characters who foil each other brilliantly but in the end the film relies too much on chase sequences as a crutch and i lost interest br br the filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we got to see who they are and identified with both cops early on we formed our own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant bickering br br in the end there is too much going on and it detracts greatly from what could've been an enjoyable piece of escapism here's what's concerning joe gavilan harrison ford at the end of the film br br 1 his real estate deals 2 his affair with a radio psychic 3 he's being investigated by internal affairs 4 the homicide investigation br br if you add in casey's concerns you fond out he wants to be an actor and avenge his father's death now some of these things do come together and even come together well but all the plot elements come together amidst this bogus chase that is so long and pathetic that i hardly have time to break my ennui and give a crap about what just happen the impressive screenwriting acrobatics cannot overcome the bad filmmaking br br as if a ridiculous chase sequence wasn't bad enough one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour wasn't bad enough joe gavilan fields calls about his real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun all these extra curricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether or not the criminal gets caught we already forgot or no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plot lines and eye candy of the chases have numbed us beyond all comprehension br br while i could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story i won't this could've been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its britches and it turned into a redundant waste of time harrison ford and josh hartnett actually did rather well and a small appearance by gladys knight is worth noting sadly none of the actors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettable br br while this will probably be better than the likes of the hulk and lara croft ii that still doesn't make this film good i once heard that harrison ford claimed to only make films that eh thought would make money i'm not sure if that's true or not what is true is that to get great box office you don't need a great movie or a great actor this film has neither in its lead roles my advice to harrison ford would be to stick to indiana jones because at least you can still run
<START> i hated this movie it was absolutely horrible poor poor pitiful acting real real real stupid criminals that weren't even the least bit funny unlike the first 2 home alone movies that were very good all the boobie traps are weak pathetic excuses for ideas poorly copied of of the first two which just meant that the people writing this movie were just lazy because their paycheck didn't go above 20 bucks a week this movie is absolutely lousy it's not worth even renting in fact don't even watch it on t v go use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two i barely give this 1 star out of 10 just trust me when i say if you liked the first two and you are not a complete stupid person you will not like this movie do not watch this movie
<START> this should be required viewing for all young people this is documentary at its best from the haunting music and terrific narration by olivier to its unflinching and penetrating analyses the world at war is unforgettable and irreplaceable for anyone who wants to know about humanity's sorry experience at the nadir of the 20th century
<START> ira levin's deathtrap is one of those mystery films in the tradition of sleuth that would be very easy to spoil given any real examination of the plot of the film therefore i will be brief in saying it concerns a play one man who is a famous mystery playwright another man who is a promising writer the playwright's wife who is much younger and sexier than the role should have been and one german psychic along for the ride director sidney lumet no stranger to film is quite good for the most part in creating the tension the film needs to motor on the dialog is quick fresh and witty michael caine excels in roles like these christopher reeve is serviceable and actually grows on you the more you see him act irene worth stands out as the funny psychic how about dyan cannon love how lumet packaged her posterior in those real tight fitting pants and had her wear possibly the snuggest tops around but she is terribly miscast in this role a role which should have been given to an older actress and one certainly less seductive but why quibble with an obvious attempt to bribe its male viewers when nothing will change it now deathtrap is funny sophisticated witty and classy the mystery has some glaring flaws which do detract somewhat and i was not wholly satisfied with the ending but watching caine and reeve under lumet's direction with levin's elevated verbiage was enough to ensnare my interest and keep it captive the entire length of the film
<START> i got to see this film at a preview and was dazzled by it it's not the typical romantic comedy i can't remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it the laughs aren't gags here they're observations laughs of recognition little shocks of oh my god i thought i was the only one who felt that way i won't give away the plot which is more than just guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend the whole family plays a part in the relationship here probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since while you were sleeping br br steve carell goes much deeper than he's gone before and for the first time i really liked him the cast is amazing a list of veteran theater actors whom i've loved in other roles but they blend to make a convincing family dianne wiest is lovely as the mother juliette binoche is luminous and hilarious who knew she was funny and even the reviled dane cook gives a warm quiet touching performance the sondre lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition and i'll buy the cd the second it's available br br don't miss this one
<START> the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo 11 and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day br br this would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window br br i am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problem br br ah a response trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data i'd say is a charming but weak and gullible argument what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by u s government that the moon missions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe things are nearly never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say you'll see things a bit different than before br br first off weather data doesn't come from nasa it comes for met agencies around the world second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation unfortunately for him his source film is public domain and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims
<START> there is a lot to like here the actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit likable family however for that reason the film does not ring true we see leo who apparently just learned of his hiv positive diagnosis essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself as well the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what leo his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him the young actor who plays leo's brother marcel is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast unfortunately the scriptwriters could not decide onwhether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of hiv on a functional appealing family or what the devastation hiv is on the victim so it only hints at both while this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers
<START> ok i am not a professional movie critic but come on a true story br br they are tunneling under another store to get underneath the bank and stumble across a tomb at tomb with a passageway which goes directly under the bank br br ok i'll play along br br but then they get into the bank and decide to go to sleep yeah i am sure with all the adrenaline pumping through them they are going to just fall asleep br br this blows the whole picture how lame br br glad i didn't have to pay to watch this one
<START> it takes a very special kind of person to make a movie that is so wretched beguiling disgusting and repulsive but make it in a way that also makes it brilliant and the quintessence of personal cinematic liberation crispin glover in all of his out there antics and predispositions truly made something that is unique in a world that has become starkly partisan this film seems to evade the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively startle everyone br br right off the bat the film takes on a rather distant paradigm if there really is a model at all and initially shapes it with the likes of shirley temple in front of a swastika and naked women pleasuring a man with cerebral palsy it's rather shocking stuff but if you had the opportunity for the q a sessions after the screenings it clearly opens up a bag of worms that leaves you wondering whether this is art or just the lowest common denominator in either guise you sense the tremor that this film will ultimately cause it will never be accepted not even by the supposed auteurs of the world who boringly speak about the human condition you may not like it but it is certainly something worth watching
<START> this movie was based on actual fact i sincerely hope not br br we get to see what appears to be numerous armed cops empty an equal amount of guns at 2 guys who only got armored torso's that's a great idea aim for the armor excuse me but how about those big fat unmissable heads or their legs for crying out loud or were there invisible tanks protecting them were they from crypton did i miss something here br br this movie started out decent enough but after 20 minutes of shoot out it really takes a turn to boringlane br br and that documentary style didn't work for me either but thats just something one finds likable or not br br highly unbelievable stuff which makes it hard to see it through 'til the end br br 3 10 for the fine editing
<START> the zombie chronicles br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 nu view 3 d br br sound format mono br br whilst searching for a literal ghost town in the middle of nowhere a young reporter emmy smith picks up a grizzled hitchhiker joseph haggerty who tells her two stories involving flesh eating zombies reputed to haunt the area br br an absolute waste of time hobbled from the outset by haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role worse still the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by brad sykes previously responsible for the likes of camp blood 1999 this isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that ed wood's movies are 'fun' he at least believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts despite a lack of talent sykes' home made movies are in fact aggravating boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative badly conceived junk the 3 d format is utterly wasted here
<START> while i certainly consider the exorcist to be a horror classic i have to admit that i don't hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do as a consequence of that i haven't seen many of the exorcist rip offs and if exorcismo is anything to go by i'll have to say that's a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it in fairness to the other exorcist rip offs this is often considered one of the worst and so maybe it wasn't the best place for me to start it's not hard to guess what the plot will be basically it's the same as the one in the exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit which happens to be the spirit of her dead father the village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism like many spanish horror films this one stars paul naschy who is pretty much the best thing about the film exorcismo was directed by juan bosch who previously directed the derivative spanish giallo 'the killer wore gloves' i haven't seen any of his other films but on the basis of these two i believe that originality wasn't one of his strong points there's not a lot of good things i can say about the film itself it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isn't worth waiting for i certainly don't recommend it
<START> possible spoilers br br although there was some good acting particularly chloe sevigny and radha mitchell in the comedy half this simply was not an engaging film the segues between the comedy part and the tragedy part were awkward or sometimes not obvious this viewer was initially confused by the fact that the supporting cast differs in the two halves i thought with the way things were laid out in the opening scene that the people surrounding melinda would be the same people just reacting differently more of a he said she said premise however what we have is two totally different stories and two totally different women both of whom happen to be played by radha mitchell br br the two playwrights in the opening scene the comedian and the tragedian supposedly take the same premise and go from there but the two stories are only tenuously related they do little to support the topic of discussion which is that almost anything can be looked at as either comedy or tragedy nice cast but a disappointing film
<START> a few days ago i watched a documentary called the fifty worst movies of all time and this is where i first heard of the incredible melting man being a lover of schlocky films i am making it a point to try to find some of the films from the documentary not just including the incredible melting man in fact melting man is the first bad film i have seen since then and i must say i am rather disappointed while it truly is a bad film it comes nowhere near close enough to make inclusion on this list br br now before seeing the documentary i have enjoyed bad films ever since i read the book the fifty worst movies of all time by harry medved despite the same title the book came out long long before the documentary and the makers of the documentary never credited medved with the concept from the medved book i have seen about 35 of the 50 films but have come to an impasse the rest of the films just aren't available on vhs or dvd so i thought i'd try the film by the same name br br the reason i was most disappointed with the incredible melting man was that there were a few good elements to the film first the melting guy special effects were generally really cool and disgusting it's obvious that a professional the famous rich baker was involved in making this look realistic however i should also point out that there were also more than a few cheap and cheesy effects as well such as the floating plastic head and the way the monster ran around after his left arm was cut off you could see it cleverly hidden under his clothes as for the story it's just stupid a group of astronauts miraculously penetrate the rings of saturn without being crushed then they comment about how beautiful the sun is as we see closeups of it this is odd since saturn is so far from it it should not look this way it should be a large speck regardless immediately the scene changes and we're told that one of the surviving astronauts is in a hospital what happened between the last scene and this one yep it's anyone's guess well soon after the survivor escapes and engages in a murderous rampage as his entire body melts br br now considering they have a psycho running about who looks like a melting popsicle you'd think the government would pull out all stops to find and stop him right wrong a general engages one lone doctor to find him no army no police just some dopey doctor even after bodies begin stacking up at no point do the doctor or general do anything to organize a meaningful search or get backup br br now given the stupidity of the film you also wouldn't be surprised to find the following br br when the melting dude is running around near the doctor's house the doctor gives his wife a powerful sedative and leaves her in the house br br when a cute old couple is driving late at night they naturally stop in an orchard to pick fruit and are killed br br when a lady sees melting dude she barricades the door to protect herself this would be smart if she didn't have the back door of the house next to her instead of just leaving the house and escaping she just waits br br when a photographer and his model are taking snapshots the guy grabs his assistant and yanks off her top why well to give the audience a cheap thrill and make it a rated r flick br br when the melting dude is finally located and the sheriff has a clear shot at him the doctor stops him even though by now the monster had killed about a half dozen people br br so as you can see the film abounds with stupid plot elements it is a very bad film but given the occasionally good special effects it just wasn't a horrible film like i'd hoped sure it's good for a laugh but no where near plan 9 from outer space in badness and never should have been included on anyone's worst film list
<START> serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains the mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems there is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters the mad doctor's nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy the results are not good this is a class c film with ok acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors there isn't much zombie action in this one and the effects while adequate are nothing special you can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes watch out for some nudity and bad language
<START> i went into this movie knowing nothing about it and ended up really enjoying it it lacked authenticity and believability some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad libbed perhaps this is typical of woody allen excuse my ignorance but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard it wasn't even at the jokes in the movie per se but at the whole movie itself the acting reminded me of seinfeld's acting where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes they are corny but if you don't take the movie too seriously you can really appreciate the humour of the actors not the characters if you're looking for a random movie and you like woody allen i'd definitely recommend it
<START> this is one of the best movies i have ever seen i feel greatly touched by the theme the movie intends to convey one sentence that keeps coming up on my mind is that history repeats itself life is what it is shown in the movie when people are young they seem not to understand their parents their own spouses people have every excuse for not sharing the dearest time with their children until too late people always have to work hard to support the whole family but are just liable to neglect the subtle feeling of their partners people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their beloved nothing is more important than the blood relation people share in this world and one is never too late to talk with their folks about what they feel at the bottom of their heart so as to achieve a better understanding between themselves so that when life has to end some day people should not feel sorry or regretful since they have kept their words and there is always hope a new life the actors and actresses are fantastic they have understood the director's intention perfectly the movie's charm lies in to me the effect of bringing a skillful and splendid fusion of cheers and tears to the audience
<START> what the hell of a d movie was that bad acting bad special effects and the worst dialogues storyline i ever came across the only cool thing here was coolio who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop however the rest of the film is awful and boring it's not even so bad you can laugh about it just plain crap and whoever compares this to the evil dead series might as well compare tomb raider to indiana jones well ok at least there was angelina jolie in tomb raider 1 out of 10
