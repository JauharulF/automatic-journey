<START> being that i am not a fan of snoop dogg as an actor that made me even more anxious to check out this flick i remember he was interviewed on jay leno and said that he turned down a role in the big budget adam sandler comedy the longest yard to be in this film so obviously snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops i'm not going to overpraise snoop for his performance in the tenants there are certainly better rapper actors like mos def who could've done more with his role but the point is snoop did a good job he can't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections but that's something even jack nicholson has a problem doing the point is i found him convincing in the role and the tension between him and dylan mcdermott's character captivating mcdermott by the way gives the best performance in the film though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by snoop's not so subtle acting being a big reader and aspiring writer myself i couldn't help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating it did aggravate me how snoop's character would constantly ask mcdermott to read his work and berate him for criticizing it but you know what i'm sure a lot of writers are like that his character was supposed to be flawed as was mcdermott's in his own way my only mild criticism of the film would be its ending for some reason it just felt too rushed for me though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters rather than plot
<START> my brother is in love with this show let's get this straight i completely agree with the people who said it was copying off of dexter's lab and fairly odd parents br br i've never really liked fairly odd parents i mean some things did make me laugh but most of the time it's downright annoying and not cute at all this is almost the same way i feel about johnny test except nothing makes me laugh on that show the gags are so stupid and pointless and to tell you the truth maybe it's just me but kids don't dress like that yes i do think johnny's hair is awesome but c'mon br br and dexter's lab that used to be one of my favorite shows and i still don't mind watching it which makes me disgusted and ashamed of johnny test making an absolute joke out of that wonderful show br br one more thing the dog is so annoying he is more loud and obnoxious than johnny and the gay accent what the fudge i hate the dog to death and i hope he dies because that would be better for kids to see than listening and watching the obnoxious crap that goes on in that show and picking up a gay accent br br unless you want you eyeballs to burn into miraculous flames and your brain fried from this show don't watch it
<START> sadly imdb does not allow me to rate judges lower than 1 what a shame this ghastly movie is so bad that i actually turned the damned thing off well before the ending the script had a few bright moments but the directing editing acting audio quality and especially timing on line delivery was so abhorrent as make judges utterly unbearable br br judges was advertised as being like a modern day comic book style western but in reality was nothing of the sort what it is most like is dog poop on the bottom of your shoe you can try to pretend it is okay but it just keeps on stinking br br why video stores think it is okay to carry this kind of crap with constant gaps in the audio and worse than high school drama class acting is beyond me we rent movies in order to see something better that what is on television but judges is worse than the most pathetic scifi channel original i intend to demand my money back from hollywood video
<START> millie is a sap she marries a rich guy named maitland and they have a child she then catches him cheating on her and divorces him but lets him keep the kid she claims to love back then in the early 1930s she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easy with no support what a sap later when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good he turns out to also be a cheat wow does she have a hard time picking men br br as a result of these bad relationships millie changes now she's a wild party girl doing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck suddenly many years pass millie's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and oddly fashions haven't changed one bit an old friend of millie's yes it's another evil man is now pretending to be the daughter's friend but he has lecherous designs on her millie promises him that if he touches the girl she'll kill him take a wild guess what happens next br br overall the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess a bit like madam x but much much less focused so often millie's motivations and actions seem to make little sense and the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it so long as it substantiates the notion that all men are pigs unusual but not particularly good
<START> i sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of hitchcock's lesser known films because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden hitchcock gem or a true hitchcock great or some other generic if only people would watch this they would see that this is a great hitchcock film just as much as vertigo north by northwest psycho rear window etc so that being said i would just like to say that if only people would watch this they would see that this is a great hitchcock film just as much as vertigo north by northwest psycho rear window etc br br now that may be overshooting a little bit the ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above but compared to the other films that hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 1930s i really think that the ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them as an almost brand new director there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career br br granted the film does start with among other things the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer and i use idiot in the definitive manner the way stephen king so often does having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people i suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then but i think it is one of the most off putting sequences in any hitchcock film i've seen br br the main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round but when he meets his match it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife's finger so begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly br br spoilers there is for example a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and just before going into the building she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss this kiss is never explained and there is also the fact that even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband or at least ultimately chooses him they look into each other's eyes but do not actually kiss br br the film is certainly beautifully photographed even more so than several films that hitch released in subsequent years there is also a performance by gordon harker as one round jack's trainer who in his stone faced expressionism reminds me quite often of the brilliant buster keaton hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous but this is a great sample of his early work
<START> this movie was not very entertaining certainly no where as original or as good as a christmas story the characters except the youngest try to emulate the preceding actors and they fail the hillbilly neighbors come out of nowhere as they weren't a part of the first movie this really sucked might have been good with the original cast then again maybe not because the story is so weak skip it
<START> jim carrey can do anything i thought this was going to be some dumb childish movie and it totally was not it was so incredibly funny for everyone adults kids i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres and now it's finally coming out on dvd this tuesday and i'm way to excited as you can see you should definitely see it if you haven't already it was so great br br liz
<START> after having seen deliverance movies like pulp fiction don't seem so extreme maybe by today's blood and bullets standards it doesn't seem so edgy but if you think that this was 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently br br when i started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until i got to the dueling banjos scene in that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible as i watched drew ronny cox robocop go head to head with a seemingly retarted young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get when you think that the kid has a small banjo which he could of probably made by hand compared to drew's nice expensive guitar you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men are br br as the plot goes it's very believable and never stretches past its limits but what really distinguishes this film about four business men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip is that director john boorman excalibur breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes so as the movie goes into full horror and suspense i really cared about all four men and what would happen to them br br the acting is universally excellent with jon voight midnight cowboy enemy of the state and burt reynolds boogie nights striptease leading the great cast jon voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable unlike reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start voight's character transforms over the course of the movie ned beatty life is also good in an extremely hard role come on getting raped by a hillbilly while ronny cox turns in a believable performance br br one thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any i had ever seen bill mckinney and herbert cowboy coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the hillbilly's br br overall deliverance was excellent and i suggest it to anyone except for people with weak stomachs and kids 10 10 see this movie
<START> we know from other movies that the actors are good but they cannot save the movie a waste of time the premise was not too bad but one workable idea interaction between real bussinessmen and russian mafia is not followed by an intelligent script
<START> brilliant kung fu scenes loads of melodrama peculiar footwear symbolism and an unhappy end makes barefoot kid an unforgettable film br br one of the silliest subtitles i've seen
<START> i don't know why the critics trashed this movie i hardly ever agree with them anyway br br the movie could have been a little scarier i don't usually go to horror movies i even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime i needn't have bothered the cinema was full of kids too heh liam was great as always i also liked catharine zeta jones theo and lili taylor eleanor nell br br the house was very gothic and beautiful in a spooky way the special and sound effects were awesome i also loved the music score particularly the gentle tunes for eleanor and her journey to save the children how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power peace and freedom
<START> falsely accused skirt chasing chums john wayne as john scott and eddy chandler as kansas charlie change identities to become alias smith and jones mr wayne becomes john jones mr chandler's is supposed to be rev smith but wayne calls him dr smith at no time are either of them as entertaining as roger davis pete duel jonathan harris or ben murphy although wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them career wise pretty blonde mary kornman as anne grown up from her days in our gang is a lovely interest for wayne she and chandler have a couple of cute scenes with wayne if you're not a fan of low budget john wayne films of the 1930s this movie won't make you one
<START> et's obsession with dannielynn smith is despicable leave the child alone with all the constant attention she'll most likely grow up psychotic depressed or worse think of princess diana and how she longed for privacy now poor little rich girl ashley olson just wants to be left alone no wonder greta garbo became a recluse and said i want to be alone how much does et make off this little girl does et not have anything better to report on i bet there's lots of people who really don't care what color her birthday cake and balloons were by the way i never heard that anna nichole ever won any of those court cases over the will and her inheritance who is paying for the lifestyle of larry howard and little dannielynn could it be et
<START> well i guess i know the answer to that question for the money we have been so bombarded with cat in the hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie i admit i thought the trailers looked bad but i still had to give it a chance well i should have went with my instincts it was a complete piece hollywood trash once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good must be good aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long it obviously started with a moth eaten script it's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor and awful pastel sceneries it jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction this is then compounded with yes i'll say it bad acting i couldn't help but feel like i was watching coffee talk on snl every time mike myers opened his mouth was the cat intended to be a middle aged jewish woman spencer breslin and dakota fanning were no prize either but mr myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another austin powers movie f no stars 0 on a scale of 1 10 save your money
<START> i remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in 1993 i was 8 at the time and now at the age of 22 it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on it the 90's all of a sudden seem so far away what a great decade anyway i used to watch monstervision all the time as i am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films it was like the 90's version of chiller theater if mst3k can get dvd's why not joe bob's show at least monstervision was more interesting and informative a lot of joe bob's comments and info on the films were just hilarious most of the movies shown on the show were b or c grade but it showed a lot of a house films as well like the hammer films from england which are top notch as well as many with the stop motion majesty of ray harryhausen many were oddball flicks that you wouldn't see anywhere else like the the japanese sci fi movies besides of course godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like metal storm and motel hell with the new decade of film preservation and more independent minded directors i think monstervision would be a good show for ifc to pick up since they already have a hit with the ifc grind house show i'm sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day i guess will have to wait and see until then thats great television
<START> firstly i really enjoyed this movie and its message which is about daring to live life to the fullest very poetic with heartwarming and funny and sad scenes very lively it was a pleasure to watch here are my exceptions though the movie was way too long and at some point it kept adding more and more additional conflicts so that it started to lose the main story line i disagree though with another comment that its unrealistic to have so many people with strange problems in such a small village i think this was absolutely realistic there are incredible dramas going on everywhere we just don't know this about people we meet only superficially i disliked the ending which was so loaded with symbolism and extremely forced it left a bad taste as it was just too much i did not like it that so many big issues were dramatically mentioned in the group when some accused others in front of everyone else of major things people would just be more ashamed to voice everything so personal in front of everybody even if those people are a group one is closely working with and defending oneself is a human beings strongest instinct so why on earth would daniel let himself be beaten and never fight back not even to defend himself i mean he was not weak he could at least try to defend himself when attacked but it just drove me mad to see him do nothing it was as if the storyteller tried to forcefully bring across a message like violence is not needed but the way he chose to do this was not good i am also against violence but the character loses credibility when he stays unmoved despite all the attacks and gabriella why on earth would a woman who has spent years with a man beating her up go to that man when he gets arrested and say i do not wish you any harm you have just done your best like all of us oh really this spoiled so much was she going to be a saint or what it would be normal for her to be bitter but not so almost holy and therefore not human was her work with daniel and the music so great that it made her forget all of the s t that happened to her oh please so these were the spoiling moments nevertheless i still think this is a delightful movie all in all which is amazing enough given my discomfort with quite a few things watch it
<START> lost is largely considered one of the most beautiful tv series that have never done and so is if you lovers of mysteries intrigue and adventure this is the series for you in the first season since the first episode starts to go increasingly to move forward until you get to the second season in the second you lose a little its cocktail of mystery and expectation and pushes very on and reveal the various mysteries that the island hides the third season is perhaps the second most beautiful because resumed suffered since the first episode with the pace and tenacity of the first season the fourth also not let pass unnoticed and tends to reveal a little mysteries but not as the second season but at a somewhat different for the fifth season expects
<START> the movie deserves 2 10 1 5 stars for the girl i'm sorry i'm biased i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies and 0 5 for the fact that it is shorter than azumi 1 i watched azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating i amazed myself being able to sit through it br br lets talk about the plus points of the movie the girl ueto aya is cute thats all there is to salvage the whole movie the fact is if the main character was male i am sure that most people including me would not have touched the movie at all br br now lets talk about the minus points firstly it is real draggy with lots and lots of repeated scenes scenes of nachi and azumi keeps coming back it seems more like a drama way of shooting typical japanese dramas love flashbacks and this movie too secondly the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting i do not mind unrealistic movies but this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs etc it reminds me of shinobi though shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting moreover to portray i don't know what effect the director films people dying with blood spraying literally all around people not realizing their head was cut off etc etc etc too many of these spoils the show it seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie it degrades the show greatly thirdly isn't azumi supposed to be an assassin she seems more like an one man army to me just that she is a female i don't think you see assassins charging into army camps the only time i felt she acted assassin liked was when she killed the kiyomasa kato at the end of azumi 1 lastly the plot was thin in both movies its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way
<START> la lupa mannara aka werewolf woman of 1976 is a film with a highly promising title but sadly the film itself is pretty far away from being a must see for my fellow italian horror buffs you won't hear me say that rino di silvestri's film is entirely bad it has its stylish moments and the first half is actually great fun to watch though the fun is unintentional the film also profits from an exceptionally exhibitionist leading actress annik borel however the film which has no real plot at least no linear one often makes no sense at all and it drags incredibly throughout the mostly superfluous second half br br daniella annik borel has strange dreams about a dancing around naked in the night before turning into a werewolf woman since she was a raped as a girl daniella is afraid of men then when her sister cult siren dagmar lassander comes to visit with her husband daniella suddenly feels attracted to the husband and subsequently turns into a werewolf woman herself or something the storyline really doesn't make the slightest sense which makes the film a lot of fun to watch throughout the first half the leading character daniella is some schizophrenic mixture of frigid hysteric and lusty nymphomaniac who occasionally turns into a werewolf woman director di silvestri chose to make up for the plot holes with a lot of of female nudity which works fine for me there are also some pretty well done gore moments the film is never even slightly suspenseful or creepy but it is very entertaining in the beginning also there are no attempts to hide that this is a slice of sleaze the camera often does close ups on the miss borel's private parts for the simple heck of it i'm not complaining then for some reason di silvestri chose to make the film longer by completely changing the direction in which it was going while daniella is at first a typical werewolf who cannot help but follow the urges of her curse this suddenly changes when she meets a guy howard ross who was in fernando di leo's il boss of 1973 suddenly she goes back to normal again and the subsequent part of the film does not at all go in hand with the first half it gets pretty damn boring after a while all things considered it probably would have been better for this 99 minute film to be only 70 minutes long at the end they even want to make us believe that the absurd story if one can call it that is based on true events werewolf woman has some redeeming qualities my fellow italo horror fans can give it a try however if you wanna watch italian horror exploitation cinema from the 70s there are hundreds of films that you should see before seeing this one
<START> there are few really hilarious films about science fiction but this one will knock your sox off the lead martian's jack nicholson take off is side splitting the plot has a very clever twist that has be seen to be enjoyed this is a movie with heart and excellent acting by all make some popcorn and have a great evening
