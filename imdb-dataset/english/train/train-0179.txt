<START> despite the occasionally stilted acting and seen it all before story this is a fairly compelling movie br br it has suspense the scenes with the demon are actually pretty creepy some of the visual effects are superb and best of all no ridiculously ill placed humour to detract from the film as too many wannabe horror films have in them now br br honestly this isn't the greatest film ever made but it actually draws you in and at least makes an attempt at character development br br i was glad i watched it
<START> i picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales well for the previous it is better than daytime television though i'm not sure how much br br it does have its points but after about the first 20 30 minutes the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a made for tv movie that was put together with not much time to make something that will hold together in short a terrible sci fi channel type movie br br it has its points such as the future is dirty like blade runner showed of course this is no blade runner the captain looks sort of feels like actor robert forster the kind of person one might want to be around br br but unfortunately it rather ends up feeling like a bad andromeda rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart gunners of aliens the mystic is vampire willow sexually intensified and the new captain might as well be like jan michael vincent running around on danger island in the banana splits he only put on the uniform with the epaulets he's got very little right to it all of them running around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like the 'eureka maru' as they are fighting a class of 'people' who occupy the universe and are broken up into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualities just like the nietzcheans in andromeda br br it might have a redeeming feature with michael ironside but after a while one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot he probably had fun doing it but it doesn't help the movie much br br it's okay okay in the way that one might watch the dvd once without turning it off if they watch it with commercials they will probably change the channel one might watch it once but a few hours later be wondering what it was that made them watch it all br br for me that was the femme fatale when she was fighting
<START> although the movie is clearly dated audiences can still easily identify with the plight of hapless buster in this timeless and very funny underdog tale buster fights against unkindly odds in three different ages the stone age the roman age and the moden age playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different ages in this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the caveman stereotype who wins his love not by romance but by brute force as well as a funny twist on roman gladiatorial combat two comedic sketches that long predate such spoofs as mel brooks' history of the world part i the underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing although the times may have a changed we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to win the girl keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 america a time when chauvinism was still en vogue it is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie's modern times to now
<START> tintin and i first of all struck me as a masterpiece documentary the photography and the editing are truly breath taking almost anti dogma br br we follow the life of tintin drawer hergÃ© through an open hearted interview from 1971 the tintin series was drawn on the background of the great ideological fights of the twentieth century in the midst of these hergÃ© has his own demons to fight with and much of his drawing activity seems like an attempt to tame these and to escape into a world of perfection br br even though there are spectacular photographic panoramas of drawings from tintin albums and also some reconstructions and reading of passages from the albums the story of hergÃ© is told entirely through interviews and archive material and never through reconstructions br br hergÃ© lived the turbulent life of a true suffering artist but the fantastic world that came of his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again
<START> well i would consider police story as one of jackie chan's best film the plot the fighting scenes and the stunt works are excellent in this film jackie himself acted as a police officer called chan ka kui kevin chan in some versions who successfully arrested a crime lord after the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence he framed chan for the killing of a police officer due to this he became wanted by the police later on salina brigitte lin who was the secretary of the crime lord went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to chan however the crime lord knew that salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her later on chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen defeating them one by one at the last scene chan was seen punching the crime lord lastly this is the best action and comedy movie everyone should watch it highly recommended
<START> the sun should set on this movie forever br br it goes on forever which isn't usually a bad thing the english patient schindler's list but is so tedious the aging of the actors is unbelievable and so is the drawn out never ending story line which really seems to go nowhere br br in short a waste of talent and film
<START> let me make one thing clearÂ for the most part the mentality of those who run the show in hollywood frankly p sses me right off in general and even more specifically in relation to its treatment of much loved iconic characters from the pages of comic books why well let's take a typical hollywood executive board meeting scenario to illustrate shall weÂ br br executive no 1 'hey there's lots of dollars to be gleaned from superhero flicks these days ' br br executive no 2 'good point let's make one with haste then Â we'll do a lucky dip in a hat and pick out a superhero at random to base a film upon ' the dip takes place and a famous superheroes name is pulled out br br executive no 1 'great now who can we get to play the part ' br br executive no 2 'who's a big box office star at the moment ' br br executive no 1 ' name of big actor is the in thing this week ' br br executive no 2 'but does he really suit the role i mean he doesn't resemble the character whatsoever ' br br executive no 1 'who cares he's a big name we'll make the film with him in it anyway ' br br executive no 2 'you're quite right and besides we'll fill the entire film so chock full of glitzy special effects to appease the moronic masses that no one will ever question it anyway ' br br the above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons i generally loath most modern superhero movies all style no substance and simply pathetic casting of the iconic leads of course to be equitable there are exceptions to the above rule when hollywood does get it right Â take the casting of the original and still easily the best superman christopher reeve and more recently patrick stewart and sir ian mckellen in the x men films br br but back to the general negative traits displayed by hollywood todayÂ wouldn't it be wonderful if our studio executives were to always choose actors who actually suited the roles well in this less than ideal world one filmmaker does just this believe it or not by casting actors based upon their genuine resemblance to their comic book counterparts his name is sandy collora sadly but typically hollywood has not as of yet allowed collora to direct a full length film but luckily for us he has given us tantalizing glimpses of what the finished outcome would likely look like in the form of two as of yet famous super hero short features one is the superb batman dead end and the other is this mock trailer for an entirely fictitious film called worlds finest br br well let's not mince our words here Â this is absolutely awesome stuff br br the casting of mr universe winner and male model michael o'hearn who looked similarly awesome but was utterly wasted in the lackluster barbarian makes for the most perfect choice to play the iconic man of steel in fact in terms of physical resemblance there has undoubtedly never been a closer approximation to the comic character br br added to this clark bartram is back fresh from his splendid portrayal as the dark knight in batman dead end again yet another hugely judicious piece of casting br br what can i say Â if only this was indeed a real full length film hollywood studio executives Â take note this is how it should be done br br as a final note i am once again intrigued by the vastly split reactions this short film has evoked from fans tellingly the most acerbic and vehemently adverse reactions against it clearly come once more as similarly with batman dead end from a younger less cinematically experienced audience a fact betrayed by their somewhat grammatically primitive rants and liberal usage of base diction such an unfortunate state of closed mindedness is indeed a sad phenomenon albeit one that our aforementioned studio executives in hollywood will no doubt derive great satisfaction from after all these very same misguided individuals are in all probability the exact same sort of cgi addicted popcorn stuffing imbeciles that revel in the majority of crap that hollywood churns out by the deluge these days
<START> so i flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought i'd pass a half hour watching girlfight while waiting for hart's war to start with a title like that i figured it was some exploitation 'b' flic about inner city girl gangs br br much to my surprise it wasn't about that at all instead it is a well acted well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing she is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts as he doesn't really want to be a boxer only following through on their father's wishes she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead br br the story unfolds in an intelligent and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest for starters her brother's coach doesn't want to take on a female boxer after grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on yes a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot coming across more of an interesting inter human reaction with its own fight related consequences br br all in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of some time later when i saw the much advertised and acclaimed million dollar baby i thought wait a minute this seems kind of familiar needless to say i didn't watch hart's war that night
<START> never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent let's see first they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread next they encourage as many fundamentalist christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget and finally when the film hits the theaters get as many said christians as possible to see it yet again bus them into the multiplexes if necessary not on the merits of the film itself but because a 1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory br br but that of course won't be enough i imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give left behind anything short of a glowing review will be deemed anti christian br br of course this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldn't surprise anyone it is after all good old fashioned capitalism at work what does surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole left behind mindset as someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality it leaves me scratching my head it would appear that there are many many people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a rapture is going to occur and that millions of people all over the earth are going to simultaneously vanish into thin air what kind of reality i wonder are these people living in is this rapture something they actually believe in or is it something they fervently want to believe in and when they reach the end of their lives and realize this rapture has not occurred will they be disappointed and disillusioned will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the rapture is imminent br br in a way i almost wish that such an event would occur what an interesting day that would be what would be even more interesting is if the apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion not in the anthropological sense the authors of the left behind series have portrayed but as more of a stephen spielberg production with boiling clouds trumpets angels descending out of the sky moon turned to blood the whole nine yards imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true just as the evangelists had been warning for years and that there was something more awesome than just the cold hard physical reality we inhabit wouldn't that be something br br yet in the final analysis it's that cold hard physical reality that i will content myself with my life is not so meaningless that i need the fear of a rapture and the end times to make sense of it all nor do i need heaven or hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently thank you very much
<START> yesterday i went alone to the cinema because here in mexico most of the times movies from other countries are part of the so called camÃ¡ra alternativa alternative camera but after i saw this movie i realized that not all the foreign movies are alternative afortunately this is a good a example but i have to said that i enjoyed so much this movie that at the end i was happy this movie is a little spoon of hope in these days and the main lesson for me is that at the end of the day the love is main force behind us this is a good option to see a good movie in spanish and i have to mention the good music specially the main song of the movie cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena excellent song
<START> the worst movie in the history of cinema i don't know if it was trying to be funny or sad poignant or droll but the end result was unwatchable everyone from key grip to robin williams and back down to best boy should be ashamed to be a part of this film
<START> this one is just like the 6th movie the movie is really bad it offers nothing in the death department the one liners are bad and are something that shouldn't be in a noes movie freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie lisa wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while the characters are extremely underdeveloped all in all better than the 6th one but still one the worst movies of the series my rating 2 10
<START> it has its merit's morvern callar is both the merits and the disappointments she's so enigmatic so original is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that's making her so distant and un relatable or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary personally i'd call her dysfunctional br br morvern is completely detaching herself disposing of her boyfriend not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral she selfishly splashes out on a trip to spain she's seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed the only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her although by the end her friend is dumped and morvern has nothing that ties her down to humanity she may as well have killed herself br br despite managing to make spain look as gloomy and bland as the uk the director's shots were superb the lighting and color made the film visually stunning br br it's really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest it's little over 90 minutes but feels a lot longer they manage to make morvern seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you don't care about the characters or the film
<START> doc savage the man of bronze 1 outta 5 stars br br dreadful dreadful movie based on the pulp magazine paperback series by lester dent kenneth robeson about a super heroic adventure hero in the '30s and his five assistants all experts in some field of endeavor that allows them to combat evil it was a pretty hokey series but kinda fun to read when i was a teenager i knew they made a movie version in the '70s starring ron tarzan ely but i never got a chance to see it it never played in theaters where i lived and was never shown on tv now that i have finally seen the film i can understand why the plot and characters are never treated seriously it's all kind of tongue in cheek and campy kind of like the old batman tv series only without the benefit of being funny or having any visual flair corny dialogue cheesy special effects dumb stereotypes crummy action scenes and bad bad acting actually i find it kind of fascinating in its badness what could they have possibly been thinking arnold schwarzenegger was rumoured to be starring in a modern day remake but i don't imagine that would have turned out to be much better
<START> eight simple rules started as a very entertaining series i love john ritter and his character paul hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show br br i have always preferred kerry to bridget bridget has been done before kerry is quite unique and i can relate to her in many ways although i'm not sure i like the direction her character went in later series br br early episodes were fun good simple teenage plots about paul and cate disciplining the kids however i think the show lost it's sparkle when john ritter died i admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died i felt the programme did to to me the whole point of the show was based around the guide of the '8 simple rules of dating my teenage daughter' it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and the angle of the show had changed without the hennessey dad br br bridget seemed to get more annoying rory stayed the same and cate was always giving her offspring life's lessons which before seemed funnier when it was all left to paul i think the granddad is funny especially when he's watching great escape but feel c j is unnecessary to the show he is funny in parts but i felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other american comedy series over all the newer ones aren't bad just missing excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that cate works at the school and c j and granddad's always there too i would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for paul and kerry but later ones were about average at best
<START> frankly i don't understand why this movie has been such a big flop in publicity sharon stone certainly has not lost any of her charisma and touch since basic instinct i voted this film 10 and i tell you why game opens in london this time london is the city where catherine tramell has moved since the events in bi1 again she proves to be a mastermind manipulator of her own class unchallenged she is screwing your brain as catherine with such a skill that in the end you don't be quite sure who is the real villain br br as for the technical part of the film only real setback is the b rate crew of actors sharon stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and michael douglas etc in the first part i also think bi2 would have been better had sharon stone been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma her b rate assistants are not so bad either although i would have wanted some bigger names to the cast br br i think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot i think this is a far better thriller than many of the run off the mill crap hollywood so readily distributes these days the plot is great it's easy to see technically you don't snore in the half way through the film and most important the heath is on
<START> ok i'll be honest when i first saw the trailer for the programme i thought it was an advert for some sun screen product with all the people walking around on the beach despite this i decided to watch it thinking it would be some new show i could laugh at but i was seriously amazed br br from the first 10 seconds of the program i was hooked why is he lying in the trees why did the plane crash etc etc br br it's not everyday that a show comes along which combines intelligence humour action and suspense but 'lost' manages all of this with a great cast and crew beautiful locations and pretty decent special effects 'lost' will catch anyone who tunes in and is a must see for anyone who's sick of cheesy sitcoms and crappy reality tv br br lost is on tuesdays at 10 on channel 4 uk 4 8 15 16 23 42 o
<START> the first one meant victory this one means defeat it takes place in a bolivia there the guerillas are sick and wary and don't meet that much sympathy from the farmers if you know your 60s history you understand how it ends you will understand it even without that knowledge br br del toro is once again splendid he goes on building this icon about the revolutionary who remains the same regardless of success or failure that's what guevara is according to the legend but still it's so well acted br br the documentary feeling is there around the icon which is one of the greatest achievements in this big soderbergh project he has succeeded
<START> this is some of the worst acting i have ever seen i love almereyda's nadja but this is just absolute dreck aside from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music this film is just nonstop bad acting and dumb material jared harris is particularly bad but no one in this is remotely good the plot is a joke but not the haha kind i don't even know if you can forgive movies that are this bad please erase the last hour and a half of my life how did this director make nadja and another girl another planet
<START> i really liked this movie i saw the original classic a few times but could hardly remember any details i think this movie is much better than the cartoon its not so black and white as it i specially liked how they made the grinch such a complete character and gave a cause of why he was the way he was the villain in this movie was not the actual grinch but the major much different than the original cartoon jim carrey was perfect for the part all in all a great movie made for both kids and adults alike
