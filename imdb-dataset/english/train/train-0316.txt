<START> i remember when this film was up for the academy awards and did not win in any category for the life of me i cannot remember what it was up against but one thing i can say it was one of the best movies i have ever seen and the fact that steven spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bit br br essentially it is about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman there are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with along the way we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption whoopi goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie danny glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film br br and the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent beloved did i encourage anyone of any race to see this film 9 10
<START> i like this episode quite a bit ruth gordon is good if not a little hammy as she always was as has been stated the music is very good and it has a moodiness that doesn't exist in all episodes br br but one major plot hole exists so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it it is established that the light doesn't work in the vault don't you think that the very intelligent columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked you'd think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note granted this is tv whodunit fiction and various holes will always be found but this seems much too glaring br br it really doesn't make columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn't work but the death bed testimony goes on unfound apparently for days
<START> this movie starts out promisingly with an early scene in which frank morgan advises against gary cooper's marriage to his daughter anita louise frank morgan playing an unabashed gold digger loudly complains to cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family including his daughter anita louise i am a fan of all 3 actors frank morgan is to my mind a hollywood treasure cooper a legend and louise a very lovely versatile and under appreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role i also have nothing against teresa wright and while not blessed with great range she usually delivers heart warming performances br br from a promising opening the story slides downhill all the way to the end i found nothing humorous about burning down the home of cooper's would be in laws the butler in such a fastidious non smoking household would never just blithely walk away allowing cooper to continue smoking or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his ill timed cigarette moreover nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it and finally nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket this whole sequence just made cooper seem foolish and gauche it is a poor contrivance ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter br br the forced medical examination of cooper is equally contrived nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent that cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny it's absurd stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense and that too is nothing to laugh about finally the scenes of cooper's overly fastidious neurotic attention to his baby's feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies but to me they just seem tedious and slow the wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes while paradoxically the script writer went to sleep br br the lines are just not in the script to generate humor they just miss on all cylinders the laughs come not a mile a minute but more like a light year a minute the only time the movie has any energy or humor is when frank morgan is on camera br br the scene that is totally wasted is when both of cooper's love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together there is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine but none of it was extracted br br in the end one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt predictably it is the anita louise character who gets jilted on her would be wedding night while it is not on camera that is her fate and it is not particularly funny even as a loose end she hadn't done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic unlike gail patrick say in my favorite wife consequently i was expecting perhaps hoping is a better word in the context of the film for anita louise to enjoy a happy ending too the fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie's end really undermines the effect of the happy ending for cooper and wright br br i kept waiting for something to happen for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era and it never delivered a good performance by frank morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here
<START> i must admit out of the eros movie collection this has to be the one that i love the most as well as one other that i have also reviewed the story is something that really keeps you watching a lot of the eros films have a plot that looks like a hammer broke it in pieces before production when you watch it all centering around sex and who can get with how many different people come the end of the film and oh dear god never watch one of these films when someone pulls out a gun it does not work that it is almost laughable but you do not want to waste the energy to do so br br losing control is exactly as its name comes on the protagonist the leading character the wonderfully talented and beautiful kira reed the control is the control a person has over their senses their body and feelings and one man changes everything for her makes her a different woman almost but the mirror is shattered at the same time this makes for a great film that i wish i had come up with first br br 10 10
<START> what a strangely wonderful if sometimes slight and bulky big budget fantasy this is takashi miike had already proved by the time he got to the great yokhai war that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crime yakuza genre visitor q and andromedia showed this the former great the latter lesser but here miike in his first and only co screen writing credit no less proves that he can deliver the goods on a post modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions and with it boatload of cgi creature effects and make up and an epic battle that is more like a festival than something out of lord of the rings the comparisons can be made far and wide to be sure and the most obvious to jump on would be miyazaki for the seemingly unique mixture of kids as big heroes power hungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source machinery as the greatest evil and many bizarrely defined flamboyantly designed creatures or yokai of the title but there can also be comparisons made to star wars especially to the gungan battle in tpm and to the whole power play between good and evil with similar forces or to anime like samurai 7 or of course to henson's films and through all of these comparisons and even through the flaws or over reaching moments it's miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters br br here ryunosuke kamiki plays tadashi the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world but will become the hero in a world going into darkness the darkness is from an evil sorcerer who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures the yokhai into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission to destroy and kill anything in their paths tadashi gets as pumped up to fight sato the sorcerer as the yokai once sato's main minion and cohort agi kill bill's chiaki kuriyama another great villainies steals tadashi's little furry companion a sunekosuri soon things come to a head in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories but can only be contained up to a point by miike and his crew i would probably recommend the great yokai war for kids but in the forward note that it's not some watered down fantasy in american circles this has creatures galore including a one eyed umbrella stand and a walking talking wall not to mention a turtle a fire serpent and a woman who became cursed by sato so the variety is on high on that end and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects which grows to unfathomable heights when the festival hits with the yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope but there's also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark and sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at miike's disposal and not just because it's cuteness squared where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury who ends up in a tragic battle with tadashi in robot form br br yet through all of this the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of miike's career is here as well which distinguishes it from its animated muppet and sci fi counterparts there's the bizarre humor as usual including a song dedicated to akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes i loved for example the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller or the anxious turtle yokai the biggest danger with miike's access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry which he flirts with is overkill on this end he's got everything down i'm sure with storyboards and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions one of them is when all is said and done and tadashi and the 'other' human character are in the middle of the tokyo rubble in an overhead shot but the cgi is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots and the interplay skirts on being too flamboyant and some visuals like the overlay of the yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map just seem weak and pat i almost wondered if miike might dip into bad spy kids territory quite frankly br br but this liability aside the great yokai war provides more than a share of excitement goofy thrills and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies it owes a lot to cinema as well as traditional japanese folklore but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats it's not the filmmaker at his very best but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage it's got a neat little message and lots of cool adventure 7 5 10
<START> the author sets out on a journey of discovery of his roots in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the completely and deservedly forgotten movie bright leaf is about an ancestor of his its not and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and self indulgent glorified home movie suitable for screening at the director's drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial or even non commercial release a good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios because they are boring irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and his her immediate circles avoid at all costs
<START> my girlfriend and i have a thing for robots so i try to seek out movies that have robots and this movie has robots big ones they beat the clang and bang out of each other with the fate of nations hanging in the balance it's really cool you have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget it is very hard to dislike this movie because of those big robots they looked like transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers it made my girlfriend smile and that is good enough for me and special mention must be made of veteran character actor paul koslo as the maniacal russian villain whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after they've already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste like blood a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub bela lugosi accent he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on screen this is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation
<START> the first in the series was brilliant easily one of the best horror films of all time this is the crappiest when i sat down to watch this i was actually thinking that how bad the fourth and fifth ones were this would have to be good after the previous terrible ones boy was i wrong incredibly wrong br br when i watched the first ten minutes of it i was actually really tempted to turn it off but i thought no maybe it'll improve it didn't br br not only is this just a dire film by itself it didn't need another sequel because the last two fourth and fifth had already been terrible enough also how many times can you bring freddy back the acting in it was terrible the story line was predictable and crap and it also had flaws in it as well the way they made springwood was just totally wrong pays no respect to the first one at all to add to this the whole thing seemed really over the top br br some people are saying that this film was funny this film is not funny at all since when is freddy krueger supposed to be funny i would call it funnily crap this film is supposed to be a horror film not a comedy if freddy had a daughter wouldn't that information have surfaced like in the first one the ending was also just plain stupid and cheesy exactly like the rest of it this one completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first one just shows itself up br br such a shame that wes craven created something so good in the beginning yet it has to be dragged down because of this trash that belongs in the bin they shouldn't have even bothered making this film nor any of the other sequels except the third one the third one's the only decent one out of all the sequels br br if this was a dvd by itself and not part of the nightmare on elm street dvd set that i got i would have chucked it out when i got it br br summary a pathetic and poor attempt at a sequel br br a complete mockery of the first film br br so please don't waste your time on this worthless junk
<START> sequel to the kingdom is bloodier and even more twisted i only saw half i was exhausted and couldn't sit through all 5 1 2 hours but i loved what i saw ghosts blood murder poisoning mutated babies voodoo this has it all if you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for you br br also you don't have to see part 1 to understand this you'll figure it out br br does anyone know if kingdom 1 and 2 are available on dvd sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring br br sadly there probably won't be a kingdom 3 ernst hugo jaregard sig died a year after this was filmed but you never know
<START> pokemon the movie was a terrible film unlike the first one this is not a good film at all the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was bad tracey really doesn't have much to say or do and unlike brock offers no comic relief the only good points is you get to see misty actually get jelous over ash and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining overall this film isn't worth renting and the short movie before didn't do anything for me or my wife and we do consider ourselves pokemon fans oh well maybe the next one will be better cant ge t much worse
<START> first off i really loved henry fool which puts me in a very small pool of movie goers parker posey is one of best actresses on screen today but this film was a full out travesty watching hartley and the actors talk about the film in the extras so full of pride and making pointless analogies to star wars was stomach turning this was hype on the producers part hdnet realized to the max a true example of the emperor and his new clothes mostly i feel that hal has spoiled henry fool forever i don't think i can ever see it again in it's pure innocent light br br remember hal you can fool some of the people some of the time etc the director would be nowhere today if all he did was churn out meaningless garbage sadly it's a pure example of the lesson taught in the film adaptation the story must be exciting and active or its box office hopes are dim indeed never mind a decent story for the actors it was like trying to act in a straitjacket br br the score i believe hartley's is tasteless with drum hits walking all over dialog there was one apple soundtrack loop i recognized that gave me a smile br br when i saw the trailer i thought oh they're just trying to grab a new audience but it's really this ridiculous ride i'd be happy to spoil this movie for you but it's been done it's rotten the fool franchise is dead long live henry fool
<START> stÃ¶rtebeker is truly one of the worst tv mini series ever made on this planet br br the acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense just two examples visby was shown as a village of three houses instead it was a major city at this time it's best days already passed by secondly hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the baltic sea hamburg had no access to the baltic sea the major town at that time was lÃ¼beck br br but worse than all that the directing how can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this impossible there was not a single believable scene it the fights were ridiculous and i could not suppress laughter at most stern scenes br br i can't understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent
<START> this was the best movie i've ever seen about bulimia it hit the exact spot of what bulimia is really about and how it's not always about being skinny and dieting it showed how people with bulimia tend to think about things such as their outlook on life friends and themselves the best line and the part that really shows what the problem with bulimia is is when beth says it's not about you that line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem it showed that people with bulimia don't have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else it has to do with them and them only it shows that it's time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention all on themselves it showed that beth needed to call out for attention at that moment and she needed her mom's attention at that time the most
<START> one may ask why the characters snarl yell and chew the scenery without any perceptible reason except someone wanted to make a movie in barcelona billie baldwin is that the right one is forgettable in the cop estranged husband loving father of cute little blond girl role the story seems to have been cut and pasted from the scenes thrown away from adventure films in the last three years ellen pompeo's lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to suck the energy out of every scene she is in her true acting range is displayed when she takes her blouse off as the movies careens from one limp chase scene to another unfortunately the directing rarely goes bad enough to be camp or a parody it is all just clichÃ© familiar in every respect the director cast his own daughter as the precocious brat probably because no respectable agent would have permitted a client to ruin a career by being in such a lame contrived and uninteresting movie the only heist here is the theft of the investor's money and the viewer's time
<START> this is not a bad movie it follows the new conventions of modern horror that is the movie within a movie the well known actress running for her life in the first scene this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose and manage to do something new and interesting with it it is also always nice to see molly ringwald back for the attack br br so this might be an example of what the genre has become cut hits all the marks and is actually scary in some parts i liked it i gave it an eight
<START> i enjoyed still crazy more than any film i have seen in years a successful band from the 70's decide to give it another try they start by playing some gigs in some seedy european venues with hilarious results the music is fantastic the script and acting are terrific the characters are spot on especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice makeup and personality problems the concert at the end was unreal go and see it preferably in a cinema with a good sound system
<START> i'll be blunt and to the point this film is not good at all the film buff part of me hated the acting script story direction and almost all of the editing amanda peet has proven that she can act as she was a high point of 'the whole nine yards' so she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot pole however the infantile part of me found this film to be very funny if you can forget about how underpar the production quality is and if you find smut jokes funny then you should be all right and for those of you who can't get off your pedestal thats your choice my inner child hasen't died and i laughed a fair bit even then only a 3 out of ten because as a movie it really does stink
<START> i loved this flick when it came out in the 80's and still do i still quote classic lines like say it again and you said you'd rip my balls off sir ron leibman was hot and very funny although it was underrated and disowned by mad i have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that i would take with me if sent to a deserted island i only wish that someone would release the dvd because my vhs tape is about worn out if you like cheesed out comedy this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic it is military humor at it's best and worse rent it if you can't own it
<START> i wondered why i didn't like peggy sue got married more than i did when it first came out in 1986 with all the hype somehow i found nic cage's character off putting way off putting then the plot didn't seem to make sense then by the end of the credits the question came to mind what point was this movie making what was it saying the answer unfortunately was not much if anything i really don't think this movie aimed at making a statement unless it was your life is your life you're gonna make the same mistakes no matter what so keep your eye upon the doughnut and not the hole not a very profound statement and i'm sorry not profoundly made in this movie the writing simply isn't that good the direction is uneven and is strangely overblown at times kathleen turner was the best and in my opinion only worthwhile thing in this movie and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre unexplained circumstances with a script that had no apparent statement to make br br she also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason i didn't enjoy this movie more she states in her autobiography that cage made a point of fighting his uncle coppola's direction every step of the way doing it his own way not a good idea for a new actor and putting on a goofy voice she called stupid his voice was annoying abrasive and unnatural and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy i understand what he was attempting to do play a young guy hot shot who is not as hot as he thinks he is setting up his own karma for future failure but he goes overboard the way he does it is abrasive not effective and if he had listened to his uncle instead of fighting the man we would have had a more enjoyable film cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person and those scenes are more watchable than others but if i had to watch the movie through in its entirety i would find myself wanting to pay someone in l a to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected put on scenes br br the movie doesn't aim for a statement doesn't make a point is great to look at except when cage is doing a demented elvis impression but without the voice and is ultimately confusing and a waste of time given all this kathleen turner surely deserved an oscar in this flailing mess of a movie i can't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this unless you like turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes believe me you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes and it will make just as much sense br br kathleen turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her cage comments which proves that she's strong enough to be honest and to hell with other people's comments you go turner i'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than i am of any other first rate actor or actress but her candor is refreshing cage's acting can be good to annoying and here it doesn't work at least in this film now we know why
<START> this is one of my two or three favorite stooges shorts and undoubtedly christine mcintyre's best performance with the trio she is good in a number of other shorts but here she is absolutely brilliant her singing is not funny at all in fact it is downright beautiful but the plot is constructed in such a way that the singing enhances the humor rather than detracting from it we listen to mcintyre sing the entirety of voice of spring no less than three times but it never gets old partly because we don't tire of her voice and partly because it blends so well with the stooges' antics the use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of kitty carlisle's role in the marx brothers' a night at the opera but the singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in opera and mcintyre perhaps more in other performances than here exhibited a comedic talent of her own that carlisle never did the stooges' buffoonery mcintyre's singing and a well constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars
