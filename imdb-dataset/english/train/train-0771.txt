<START> a top contender for worst film ever made joanna pakula's character seems to have an i q of 3 which is only one less than the writer and director the screenplay would not have passed in a high school writing class the jokes are juvenile the concept corny these performers were obviously desperate for work i stayed to the end only to see if it would get worse it did life is too short to spend any part of it watching this film
<START> why this movie has all but disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime conan is perhaps the only sword and sorcery movie better the brutal violence cool character designs and good pacing make this one of the best fantasies around it is certainly the greatest animated movie aimed at a more adult audience that i have ever seen this is not similar to bakshi's usual frenetic style it's quite a departure for bakshi and in my opinion his best work i hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves
<START> i came across this film by accident when listing all the films i wanted my sister to record for me whilst i was on holiday and i am so glad that i included this one it deals with issues that most directors shy away from my only problem with this film is that it was made for tv so i couldn't buy a copy for my friend br br it's a touching story about how people with eating disorders don't necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies it brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of
<START> yet another forgettable warners foreign intrigue thriller this is rendered even less enjoyable by the irritating presence of lauren bacall who without humphrey bogart's tender attentions to humanize her comes off as her usual shrill shallow self even master gigolo charles boyer cannot feign romantic interest in her
<START> just saw this film and i must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film this was absolutely horrible but not in the sense that was intended i'm sure br br it was like a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all would be viewers are morons or extremely hard up for entertainment or both thank god for fast forward i can't imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when making this film i mean you have actors trying to be serious albeit barely and a script that cries for a total rewrite i just can't say anymore if harlequin romance decided to do horror films this would be a good effort br br if you found this movie to be entertaining then i strongly suggest that you seek out some guidance as to the purpose of movies there is much better fare out there join a club read reviews but above all avoid crap like this
<START> for people interested in business and the corporate world this show is simply the best of the best as one of the former contestants of the show wrote in his blog about this innovative show people in business finally had an audience the whole idea is perfect having a group of businesspeople competing against each other in business related tasks set in the best place in the world new york city donald trump is perfect as the boss even though his ego is bigger than the whole universe times infinity he also makes a lot of questionable decisions about whom to fire which is one of the negatives about the show br br season 1 great season overall the best season of the normal ones this season was the one that was most about actual business skills later on the series almost drowned in marketing related tasks with way too many product placements great and interesting contestants overall with the most likable character ever in this series troy i know i'm not the only person who suspect that the trump world tower episode where he got fired was rigged to have amy and nick win this particular task br br season 2 also a great season the tasks were still pretty much ok and it had many interesting contestants jen m was terrible and should never had made it to the final imo also this season had the worst firing ever pamela br br season 3 terrible actually i liked the concept of book smarts vs street smarts but the cast was so utterly terrible it turned out that trump hated the cast as well that the whole season was a total disaster best moments was the second episode motel renovation with pm brian fired a guy who added nothing but huge amounts of comedy value br br season 4 an excellent season much because of the interesting and entertaining contestants this season especially randall alla marcus and the total disaster whose name was toral the take me out to the boardroom episode is one of the absolute classics of this show ending with the well remembered quadruple firing sadly i think we got robbed for the randall vs alla final i think trump was afraid that she could have won and prevented that from happening br br season 5 a boring season with really no special things to it brent was just an embarrassment and obviously only there to create drama the tasks were terrible overall how has creating a jingle anything to do with business at all i guess the best man won but personally i couldn't care less br br season 6 i can see why they wanted to try out l a as a new location for the show but looking back it was a mistake new york will always be the place for this this season added so many new things most of them terrible like losing team having to sleep outside in tents winning pm continues to be pm for example the tasks were terrible and trump also chose the wrong winner james deserved it no doubt br br season 7 celebrity edition best season ever totally different rules like the use of rolodexes but all fun and entertainment the biggest problem was that many of the contestants were not real celebrities at all especially the women where everyone were unknown to me except for omarosa who is a total disgrace to everything she takes part in this looked to be gene simmon's season but after he made a complete fool of himself during the kodak task another man emerged from the shadows piers morgan never has anyone dominated a season like he did he crushed his opponents and also came across as a guy with a great sense of humor although some uptight americans not all americans of course don't take me wrong sadly didn't have the social skills to understand it way to go piers br br for fans of this i highly recommend the uk version starring sir alan sugar as the boss in fact the british version is way better and that says something since the american and original truly is a great show one thing about the uk version is that the contestants normally tend to behave like decent human beings in the boardroom unlike the constant yelling and rude behavior that takes place in the us version
<START> the quintessential georgian film of georgi danelia ne goryuy 1969 aka don't grieve is loosely based on the novel by french writer claude tillier 1801 1844 mon oncle benjamin the novel takes place in the country side of the 18th century france the great french revolution is still ahead but some of its stormy signs are present in society benjamin the local doctor is a soul of a local society the educated friendly democratic person who often treats the poor for free it makes him very popular with the locals but most certainly does not help with his bank account he is in love with a beautiful manette who is also crazy about him but is being watched closely by her father who called his daughter his small capital and is determined to protect her virginity until the moment the marriage contract has been signed i never read the book and from description it sounds like a charming very french novel but i am fascinated with the results of moving the characters and some plot elements from 18th century france to the beginning of 20th century georgia grusiya i would think that it was danelia who came up with all the colorful memorable characters that feel so much at home in his native georgia grusiya the land of long and wonderful traditions including art of making and drinking wine rare music talent that all georgians seem to possess very unique humor and high code of honor when we watched the film last night together with my husband he said what a great example of an art film and i so agree with him don't grieve is a perfect art movie visually beautiful deep but funny at times sad and philosophical but never in a preachy arrogant way but optimistic celebrating life with all its beauty and sadness full of interest loving irony and understanding for its slightly eccentric but very human characters what is the most important the film is warm and gentle it does not look down at its viewers as some of the art pictures do you don't have to be a movie buff to love it to live with it to smile and sigh at it to follow the good hearted young doctor benjamin first role in a danelia film of famous singer and actor wachtang kikabidze with whom danelia would go on to make two more films including one of my all time favorites mimino on his journey through the roads and mountains of georgia or to be a guest on one of a kind party where the friends gather to celebrate life of the old doctor levan who wanted to be a guest on his own wake to hear what his friends have to say about him when he dies while he is still alive and who gets to choose which color he prefers for his coffin when i watched the film i thought that it is a sort of movie that federico fellini might have liked i was not surprised at all to find the article about danelia where he names fellini his number one director i also found out that according danelia the famous soviet directors leonid gaiday the creator of many beloved comedies and sergei paraszhanov the visionary whom i don't have to introduce loved another danelia's film fairy tale about american boy huck finn sovsem propashchiy felt and spoke negatively about don't grieve while fellini praised it highly i dare go a little further and just guess that perhaps maestro fellini kept in mind some images and the very aura and atmosphere of don't grieve when he was making amrarcord in 1973 just a thought because there is something essential that connects both films both artists came back to their roots to the places that they love deeply to the people they remembered loved and wanted to honor both films have a lot of smiles through the tears both are art movies that would get directly to the hearts of the viewers both are masterworks br br i think i am going to add georgi danelia to the list of my favorite directors he has made some of the brilliant pictures in my most favorite genre of dramedy even tragicomedies that are funny and bitter sweet poignant and subtle earthy and uplifting gentle and shining when i looked up the list of the movies he has written directed i was amazed at the fact that he has not made a single bad film since he started back in 1960 with the award winning story of a young boy seryozha many of danelia's films are among my favorites as i am sure they are among his legions of fans the man behind 'seryozha sovsem propashchiy 1972 which is an adaptation of mark twain the adventures of huckleberry finn 33 ya shagayu po moskve 1964 aka walking the streets of moscow ne goryuy 1969 aka don't grieve afonya 1975 mimino 1977 osenniy marafon 1979 aka autumn marathon or sad comedy which is a very fitting title for this movie as well as for the whole genre that danelia practically invented and the cult favorite for over 20 years kin dza dza 1986 is brilliant and deserves our true love and genuine gratitude for the unforgettable moments of cinematic happiness
<START> there's about 25 years worth of inspiration packed into it beginning with existential themes of blade runner as well as the vision of the future with corporate billboards advertising their products to the technology of the later matrix films and spielberg's a i and finally the black and white graphic novel look similar in style of sin city the creators have put in a lot of effort in the visual department and the outcome is a well crafted future neo noir add a detective story and you've got an interesting film i know what it wanted to be but regardless of the stunning visuals it wasn't enough to get it to the final destination
<START> trio's vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable it was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young the performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch br br observation in film it isn't necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile small morality storytelling is quaint or coy only in the eye of the beholder thankfully story content well told can overcome it's time subject or place br br ironically there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era inserting small morality content occasionally might provide a dimension lacking
<START> how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad scary and life affirming it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen even though you were hoping maybe even beleiving it wouldn't br br utlimately this is the film's greatest strength it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations then drops a bomb on you br br i saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the mid '90s it is not easy to find but is definitely worth hunting for
<START> i watched this movie last night and hoped for the best after watching all the cool trailers even the cover of the dvd looked good as soon as i started watching it i was thinking like others oh my god whats this there were some moments that were a bit creepy but then the mood was ruined by stupid music there was rock and opera during what is supposed to be suspenseful scenes that right there ruined it for me and i was shaking my head thinking damn i wasted money again on a rental and was deceived by the cover art nothing against the music itself it was just in the wrong parts of the movie whoever edited the film has no clue what they are doing the cover showed lightning implying they were caught in a storm at sea that would have been more interesting but it didn't happen the acting wasn't the worst i've ever seen considering they are all unknown and this is obvious their first film another reason i was disappointed was the plot made no sense in the beginning 2 men saw all of the teens get on a boat then at the end supposedly only 1 girl existed and the others were either her imaginary friends or were ghosts i'm not sure because it was very badly portrayed whytefox who wrote a comment on here claims this is a true story he or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a haunted boat in the area this movie was filmed there was no mention in this movie about it being a true story i have never experienced something like that personally but am not saying it's impossible i guess if anyone is interested in renting this movie do it at your own risk if you like amateur student horror films you may like this
<START> i must have been only 11 when mr peepers started it was a must see for the whole family i believe on sun nights repeating gags were rob opening his locker he had to use a yardstick or pointer to gage the right spot on another locker and do some other things finally kicking the spot whereupon his door would open and taking pins out of a new shirt at the start of an episode he would open up a package with a new dress shirt and for the rest of the show be finding one pin after another that he missed when unwrapping the shirt timing was everything and the pins got lots of laughs i remember an aunt that drove a rio like jack benny and always wanted sonny to say something scientific he would think and come up with semi permeable membrane or osmosis causing her to say how brilliant he was you had to have been there marion lorne stole the show every time she was on screen why they didn't continue the series from her pov when wally quit he was afraid he was being typecast but by then it was way too late i'll never know i saw somewhere that the 1st tv wedding big one anyway was tiny tim on the carson show horsecocky it was rob and nancy did i ever have the hots for her and i remember it made the cover of tv guide and got press in all the papers and major magazines a trip to the museum of broadcasting in nyc years ago was disappointing in that they had very few episodes then and those might be gone now i still remember it as wonderful and wish i had been a little older
<START> holy crap this movie was bad i watched it just as a joke it isn't even so bad that it's good in an unintentional way this film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry it worked really well at doing that it's as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie priest added in a bunch of ugly dudes took out anything interesting funny or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese that's all this is cheese there isn't a single person this film could possibly connect to there isn't any universe this film could possibly take place in why can't a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is why couldn't they at least even tried to make it an okay film or even a b movie now that i think of it what they hell were they trying to do with this film i watched it expecting a campy love story and instead i got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying christian brother tried to destroy it all no i'm not joking that's what it's about does that sound good this film is pretty ignorant against people of the christan religion with it's stereotyping of all christians being loudmouthed rude and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible a lot of christian people i know would never speak or act like these freaks the film however is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well these have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that roadkill video game it's so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that i wasn't able to fully pay attention to this film the makers of this train wreck had no strategy for set design acting camera angles lighting script authenticity or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting there isn't even a single sex scene or at least not a believable one jamie brett gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all but his good looks were sadly put to waste this is trash in a perfect world this film would get voted a 0 0 it's worth 0 as a film alone a mentally handicapped nun who is blind deaf and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write direct and produce a better film and she'd probably be a better actor as well the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word film itself this film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format i could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini x mas tree and then record that and i've already made a film that will always be better than ben arthur by at least half there are only two things worse than death torture and watching ben arthur i'm a homosexual and i will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me and i don't think i've ever been more offended by an entire film than i was by the first five seconds of this film alone if this movie was a mistake i will personally find a way to change the famous phrase it's okay to make mistakes to it's okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was ben arthur you know how people always say things like good things come out of everything i think that ben arthur was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of to call this movie the worst movie i've ever seen would be giving it way too much credit it's as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it's very own there are good movies there are bad movies and then there's ben arthur this is ben and arthur
<START> i am very unpolitically correct guy so when i say sexist i really mean it reduced the female guest lead dr miranda jones played by diana muldar in spite of all her supposed brilliance and self control to nothing more inside but a big jealous unreasonable baby you prolly got the plot by now after her technical sidekick marvik also a spurned lover flips out when he tried to kill the medusan ambassador kollos out of a jealous rage but glimpsed first it instead you think he could have just walked in to the room with his eyes shut and phasered the box too easy he takes the enterprise into un navigable space outside the galaxy before the boys could subdue him well the ship is stuck in limbo at that point they could have gone to the good lady doctor liaison and discussed it spock has to make a mind meld with the medusan so we can get home i mean like beetch do you want to stay adrift until we run out of supplies and die but the lady in true star trek fashion is a jealous monsters who whines and wails when the idea is broached even when her medusan idol told her to shut up go along with them so the beetch out of spite messes with the melded spock causing him to forget to put on his visor which makes spock go insane kirk naturally figured out what a total twit she was and shamed her into fixing spock up with her superior telepathic powers of course at the end the lady and medusan leave and all is forgiven you almost wish the president from battle star galactica showed up to jettison the witch out of an airlock for her destructive stunt but in star trek land ladies are permitted to be totally unreasonable and cruel yet at the same time supposedly there is sexual equality this is what i mean by sexist
<START> my wife and i just finished watching bÃ»su aka the booth she fell asleep during some parts of the movie i really wish i had taken a snooze with her but the unfortunate fact is that the main character's voice is so loud and grating that it was impossible for me to sleep when our protagonist speaks it makes me want to hear regis philbin and william shatner sing karaoke he also has no redeeming qualities i was hoping he'd get hit by a bus five minutes into the film br br don't get me wrong i love asian horror cinema but the booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really make no damned sense at all if you want some good asian cinema check out a tale of two sisters or into the mirror avoid the booth like the plague especially if you suffer from frequent migraines
<START> the premise of an african american female scrooge in the modern struggling city was inspired but nothing else in this film is here ms scrooge is a miserly banker who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits there is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved part of the problem is that story's roots don't translate well into the urban setting of this film and the script fails to make the update work also the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly the audience becomes tired of it well before the movie reaches its familiar end this is a message film that doesn't know when to quit in the title role the talented cicely tyson gives an overly uptight performance and at times lines are difficult to understand the charles dickens novel has been adapted so many times it's a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant in spite of its very relevant message
<START> warning this post may contain spoilers br br i only got a gamecube in september 2005 and the first two games i bought were james bond games the decent agent under fire and the dull goldeneye rogue agent the next game i planned to get was everything or nothing because my friend told me that it was better than the two games i already had i have to say he was right br br i bought this for a tenner in hmv and when i got home i slammed it in to my cube and played it for hours on end it was much better than my other two games and there was a much better and more interesting storyline graphics were some of the best i have seen but now that the xbox 360 has come out farcry instincts predator has some of the best graphics known to man the storyline was clever mad man willem dafoe named as nikolai diavolo and beautiful henchwoman heidi klum named as katya nadanova try to destroy the world with tiny nanobots which at the start of the game you james bond have to destroy on a train the bad thing is that one of them is hidden in katya's boobs you then have to thwart their plans and save the world br br the great thing about this game is that it actually has actors voicing the characters such as cleese voicing q there are 27 levels some of them short and some of them pretty long and tricky br br gameplay 10 10 graphics 9 10 sound 9 10 replay value 7 10 multiplayer 8 10 br br i give this game a grand total of 90
<START> i have been searching for the right words to describe this film at first i was inclined to simply skip to more significant matters as the film does not rise to a level deserving comment br br yet i stopped puzzled as to how to describe such stuff and somewhat intrigued by the challenge presented by the question what can one say about such a film rubbish no its not rubbish rubbish can be recycled into something useful greenhouse gas no its not greenhouse gas greenhouse gases help plants grow large and healthy br br finally i struck on not even bad a rework of the phrase not even wrong used sometimes in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and not even worthy of correction that's it then georgia rule not even bad
<START> yeh i know you're quivering with excitement well the secret lives of dentists will not upset your expectations it's solidly made but essentially unimaginative truthful but dull it concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice already a recipe for trouble if it wasn't for our separate work lives we'd all ditch our spouses out of sheer irritation campbell scott whose mustache and demeanor don't recall everyman so much as ned flanders from the simpsons is the mild mannered uber dad husband and hope davis is the bored stiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera one night as dad the daughters attend one of davis' performances he discovers that his wife is channeling her frustrations into more than just singing he witnesses his wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera one nice touch we never see the opera director's face dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation divorce and custody hearings profitable only to the lawyers scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wife's indiscretions br br already the literate among you are starting to yawn ho hum another story about the pathetic sniveling little cuckold but rudolph who took the story from a jane smiley novella hopes that the wellworn ness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy postmodern touches for instance one of scott's belligerent patients denis leary kept relatively and blessedly in check will later become a sort of construction of the dentist's imagination emerging as a devil on the shoulder advocate for the old fashioned masculine virtues dump the b h etc when not egged on by his imaginary new buddy scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife engaged in a three way with two of the male dental assistants who work in their practice it's not going too far to say that this movie is eyes wide shut for real people or grown ups at least along those lines campbell scott and hope davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of cruise and kidman further the script for secret lives is clearly more relevant than kubrick's as proof i offer the depiction of the dentists' children particularly the youngest one who is about 3 or 4 years old and whose main utterance is dad dad dad dad dad dad this is family life all right with all its charms br br the movie would make an interesting double bill with kramer vs kramer as well one can easily trace the feminization of the american male from 1979 to 2003 in this movie dad is the housewife as in kramer but he is in no way flustered by the domestic role unlike dustin hoffman who was too manly to make toast here scott gets all the plumb chores such as wiping up the children's vomit cooking cleaning taking the kids to whatever inane after school activity is on the docket and all without complaint and without directorial commentary it's just taken for granted br br the film has virtues mostly having to do with verisimilitude however it's dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions which culminate in a long scene where a horrible five day stomach flu makes the rounds in the household we must endure pointless fantasy sequences initiated by the imaginary ringleader leary whose existence by the way is finally reminiscent of the brad pitt character in fight club and this finally drives home the film's other big flaw lack of originality in this review i realize it's been far too easy to reference many other films granted this film is an improvement on most of them but still the secret lives of dentists is worth seeing but don't get too excited about it not that you were all that excited anyway i guess
<START> ghost of dragstrip hollow is a typical 1950's teens in turmoil movie it is not a horror or science fiction movie plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their hot rod club because they cannot meet the rent once kicked out they decide to try an old haunted house the only saving grace for the film is that the ghost paul blaisdell in the she creature suit turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by blaisdell
