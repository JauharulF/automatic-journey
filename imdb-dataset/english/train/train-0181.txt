<START> good story and excellent animation the influence of frazetta and bakshi are obvious and that's a good thing anyone that enjoys conan the barbarian or the game dungeons and dragons should enjoy it the battle between good and evil is clear cut even though it may appear that at times our hero is neutral most often in fantasy movies elves are usually portrayed as having white skin and blond hair and goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair anyone familiar with frazetta's bakshi's or even tolkien's work know they are not racist anyone that enjoys fantasy movies should like this movie it is not for young children due to violence and sexual innuendo the casting was well done and the scenes and music are first rate i hope someone puts this gem on dvd soon i consider myself lucky to have a vhs copy in good condition
<START> well ok i watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now i pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and i must say i actually think this movie is good this movie caught a buzz as the bootleg i know what you did last summer 3 much like final stab was to scream 4 and well this movie isn't that bad i mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick this movie is not half bad it has some scares and some really hot women i might add plus it shows off joey lawrence's new beefy look though obviously even that hasn't won him any big hollywood roles either i feel bad for the man he had such a career in the early and mid 90's with blossom some disney movies and the everlasting lawrence brothers show joey lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene but then like in a 360 degree turn his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one br br the movie also throws you off guard in it makes you think between the crew there really is a secret that someone knows to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret it also throws you off on who the killer is i had an idea but still woulnd't think the killer was who he was but his motives combined with the secret was a huge letdown now had there been a secret that was let out this movie could've been one of the better b rated movies but also i am a sucker for college themes and i also in college went on spring break in a mansion sized beach house similar to the one in here so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie br br a so so slasher flick good for a midnight movie
<START> i really liked this version of 'vanishing point' as opposed to the 1971 version i found the 1971 version quite boring if i can get up in the middle of a movie a few times as i did with the 1971 version than to me it is not all that great of course this could be due to the fact that i was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out however i have seen many remakes where i have liked the original and older one better i found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version in my opinion i felt the 1997 version had more excitement and wasn't so blase boring
<START> der todesking is not exactly the type of film that makes you merryÂ jÃ¶rg buttgereit's second cult monument in a row which is actually a lot better than the infamous nekromantik exists of seven short episodes Â one for each day of the week Â revolving on unrelated people's suicides in between these already very disturbing episodes buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse the episodes aren't all equally powerful but as a wholesome der todesking is ranked quite high on the list of all time most depressing art house films particularly the episodes on wednesday involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park and the one of sunday focusing on a younger man molesting himself to dead are extremely intense and devastating to observe the added value of this film or any other shockumenary like it is debatable and i'm not even sure whether or not buttgereit had any type of message to communicate here there's the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain uninformed about these people's motivations to end their lives so dramatically entirely unlike i expected der todesking isn't exploitative or repulsively graphic on the contrary actually i never could have hoped buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery the thursday episode is a perfect example of this as it stylishly shows different viewpoints of a famous german bridge while the names ages and occupations of persons who jumped off appear on the screen the production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism but this isn't what really counts in this type of cinema the subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful Â but also indispensable Â aspects of life great use of tragic music too
<START> what a bad movie i'm really surprised that deniro and even snipes would be associated with something like this if you're going to make a movie that involves baseball and shows scenes of baseball at least make the action look somewhat realistic why was the crowd always standing up for no particular reason during games possible spoiler and the last scene in the movie what was that we are somehow led to believe that deniro has found his way onto the field in an umpire's uniform and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour one of the worst ever scenes in a sports movie 3 stars out of 10
<START> the documentary and we use that term loosely apparently summarizes that muslims are trying to violently take over the world then states that any muslim that doesn't admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their ludicrous take on reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others do the thinking for them what the west needs to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental midgets if you are looking for an actual documentary on islam and the current state of the middle east i would look elsewhere try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources
<START> the lion king 1 1 2 is a very cute story to go along with the lion king it basically follows the original story of the lion king but with a couple of twists in the movie e vents are explained by a different characters point of view this story is still an original plot br br as far as sequels go disney isn't all that great at making worthwhile ones this one being the third part to the lion king simba's pride is the second actually has an original idea to it while still involving the fun of the first timon and pumbaa travel along looking for the ideal place to live after searching far and wide they find the place of hakuna matata they then meet a small lion named simba and go through many things that parents today go through br br i think this is a very good movie and i'm happy to add it to my collection
<START> wow this film was just bloody horrid so bad in fact that even though i didn't pay to see it i still wanted my money back br br the film is about nothing intelligible it's a mish mash of sci fi cliche's that were done better by much more skilled film makers the performances especially by the leads were over the top in a less endearing ed wood sort of way speaking of ed wood he'd be proud of the character's dialogue it's just too taciturn with no hint of irony or sense of humor on top of that it doesn't make sense nor does the plot or lackthereof br br the visual effects are okay but not enough to go oh wow that's cool and they just seem to be thrown in to be cool rather than be a good plot device br br the soundtrack was another mishmash of stuff that really never set any sort of mood again it seemed as if the director was just throwing in songs in the film in an effort to be cool br br which brings me to my final point perhaps if the director actually worried more about plot story and dialogue instead of trying to be cool he wouldn't have made such a dorky cliche' of a short film br br
<START> slaughter high is about a boy named marty he was harassed and picked on in high school a group of kids played several pranks on him and these pranks were really bad the last prank ended tragically br br cue to 5 years later the gang of kids meet up again for a reunion one of them set it up at the old high school the school is now abandoned and they have to break in for some reason the janitor is still there but he tells them to go ahead and have fun because they give him a beer br br they start partying and looking at their old lockers and they see something of marty's one girl feels sorry for marty but another guy calms her down br br once the kills begin it is great every kills is creative and gory we see a figure in a jester mask hunting them one by one throughout the school it appears marty is back to exact revenge after the first person is killed they find out they are locked in the school they begin looking for a way out br br now there are a number of illogical things in this movie first of all i don't know anyone who has a 5 year reunion second of all after the first kid dies a girl gets blood all over her they all run away in a panic yet she runs to the bathroom and finds a bathtub hrr friend has just been killed and she decides to take a bath more importantly why is there a bathtub in a school bathroom anyways the bathtub doesn't seem to really work and she dies a horrible death this is an 80s movie it is a horror slasher who cares if it has some illogical parts i for one don't this movie has really great deaths the ending there is a twist having recently seen haute tension i can compare the two the only way they are similar is that there is a twist which kind of left me disappointed then right after the twist comes a great if not the best kill in the movie br br after the last kill the killer looks at the screen and also does something crazy and it was the perfect way to end the movie it has me going wow
<START> i'll dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic new yorker persona because quite frankly to draw comparisons with bumbling loser josh kornbluth is just an insult to any such director i will also avoid mentioning the spot on satire office space' in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe i can however compare it to waking up during your own surgery Â it's painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what they're doing haiku tunnel is the kind of film you wish they'd pulled the plug on in its early stages of production it was cruel to let it live and as a result audiences around the world are being made to suffer br br the film's premise Â if indeed it has one Â is not even worth discussing but for the sake of caution i will josh kornbluth a temp worker with severe commitment phobia is offered a permanent job his main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss but ludicrously he is unable to perform this simple task my reaction big deal that's not a storyÂ it's a passing thought at best one that should've passed any self respecting filmmaker by br br the leading actor Â if you can call him that Â is a clumsy buffoon of a man with chubby features a receding untamed hairline and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe making to plain disturbing where o where did the director find this schmuck what's that you sayÂÂ he is the director oh my mistake playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing but i suspect that mr kornbluth isn't that convincing as a human being let alone an actor rest assured this is by no means an aimless character assassination but never before have i been so riled up by an actor's on screen presence my frustration was further confounded by his incessant to camera monologues in between scenes i mean as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel kornbluth insults us further by explaining' the action first rule of filmmaking dramatize exposition'Â show don't tell who does this guy think he is he has no charisma no charm and judging by his hawaiian shirts no sense of style his casting agent should be shot point blank br br the supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom i felt with but one exception patricia scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as helen the ex secretary who has been driven insane by her old boss and makes harassing phone calls from her basement while holding a flashlight under her face this did make me chuckle to myself but the moment soon passed and i was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film br br the film's title is also a misnomer haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of japanese poetry don't be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box officeÂÂÂ there's a very good reason for that br br
<START> i never seem to write a review on imdb unless i am extremely surprised at how good or how bad a movie is this film falls into the first category every year i try to see all the nominees for best foreign film at the oscars even those that i know i won't like as it is in heaven seems to fit the bill the plot sounds sugary and sentimental and slow for my tastes which run more towards original dark and or daring foreign cinema michael haneke francois ozon a lot of modern japanese korean cinema as it is in heaven does not sound particularly interesting it didn't get released in the usa so i sat down to watch a vcd i found in singapore preparing to cross it off the list after a dull beginning as it is in heaven becomes that rare film where you really become inspired by what is happening on screen weak points the characters in the film are pure stock characters the wounded dreamer the town bully the battered wife the loose woman yearning for love the repressed minister thankfully they're largely a likable bunch as well as being well written and well acted ingela olsson as the minister's wife inger would have been nominated for an oscar had her performance been in english strong points the music is beautiful and the main song sung by gabriella is truly dramatic and memorable and keep an eye out for the feisty 87 year old actress playing olga who is keeping up with the dancing steps as well as the younger ladies i won't discuss the ending but i will say that it makes sense they're are a lot of emotional things happening in the last hour of the film and you're not quite sure why they're happening although nothing is explained in words it all makes sense as the movies comes to a fitting crescendo out of probably the strongest swedish movie i've ever seen
<START> one of disney's best films that i can enjoy watching often you may easily guess the outcome but who cares its just plain fun escape for 1 hour forty two minutes and after all wasn't movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway the cast sparkles with delight magictrain
<START> i'll say one thing for jeanette and nelson even when stranded in a mirthless witless painfully inept musical like this there's still that twinkle in their eyes yes the chemistry between the famous duo is there even when the material is paper thin even when the score is practically a throwaway non existent one depending on just a couple of catchy tunes and even when the circumstances are so unbelievable yes even for a fantasy br br truth to tell she has more chemistry with nelson than with her own real life husband gene raymond in smilin' through which nonetheless was a considerably better film br br sorry i love jeanette and nelson as much as the next fan but this is the bottom of the heap jeanette is more than embarrassing in her one hep number with binnie barnes and nelson can only come up with a blank stare when faced with the most ludicrous situations br br one can only wonder what this was like on broadway in 1938 surely it must have had more wit and style than is evident in this weak mgm production edward everett horton fizzles in an unfunny role and none of the supporting players can breathe any semblance of life into this mess it's like amateur night at the studio even with the few professionals sprinkled among the supporting cast br br summing up painfully clumsy rendering of a rodgers and hart musical can't recommend it even for fans of macdonald and eddy and even if jeanette's close ups still glow with her gossamer beauty this film is jaw droppingly bad
<START> for real film people this film is a must since it works as a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves janos rukh boris karloff's science has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena this light can do harm or it can be harnessed to do good on the one hand it blinds his mother on the other it is used to cure blindness i can see shouts a young girl on whose eyes this light is projected when rukh karloff is himself poisoned by the uncanny power of this light we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection an entity viewed on film only visible as in a movie theater when the lights are out br br there is a wonderful passage near the beginning where karloff rukh explains his research as being informed by the fact that everything that happens is captured in light which rolls through space for millions of years as the light from andromeda was emitted from that galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock br br there are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed to older cultural vehicles that of the writer in the persona of beulah bondi arabella stevens and religion emblemized in the sculptural figures on the local cathedral karloff blasts with his projector ray gun br br one has to wonder here if this film was meant to glance at what was going on in germany at the time and particularly at riefenstall's use of film the year before to promote a regime that certainly would go on to do a lot of harm triumph of the will br br happily in the end mother violet kemble cooper intervenes reminding janos rukh of the first rule of science br br if only more movies made you want to stand up in the theater and shout i can see
<START> why is this show so popular it's beyond me why people like it i think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there br br because it's so popular i've tried more than once to watch it and i can't make it through an entire episode br br for one thing the acting is horrible everybody is overacting to the point where it's annoying to watch they talk in unnatural voices use unnatural tones and have unnatural body language i've seen better acting in a kindergarten school play br br for another thing it's not funny the plots are dull they're not creative intelligent or funny shouldn't a sitcom be funny why am i not laughing br br lastly what is seventies about this it's about as authentic to the seventies as happy days was to the fifties br br oh and what is up with ashton kutcher who cast this untalented dweeb and now he's making movies oh save us all br br if people think this is quality television it worries me
<START> i have to say i was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films i have no idea why but i trusted sexo pudor y lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non existent industry maybe it was because the soundtrack which i listened to before i saw the film sounded different from others maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces apart from demian bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors and supposedly dealed within it's script with modern social behaviour maybe because it's photography i saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical the film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser and a major letdown what serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned battle of the sexes as in all men are the same and why is it that all women blah blah blah nothing new in it not even that it uses so much common ground and clichÃ¨ that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the female male condition full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clichÃ¨s i talked about before those always work always and screaming performances it is a well acted film in it's context and by screaming i mean literally the at first more compelling characters played by monica dionne and demian bichir turn out to be according to serrano the more pathetic ones i completely disagree with serrano they shouldn't have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come through he made sure we got his message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood anyway it is after all a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it if you accept to be manipulated by it
<START> spend your time any other way even housework is better than this movie the jokes aren't funny the fun rhymes that are dr seus aren't there a very lousy way to waste an evening my kids 4 16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net my wife left and did dishes so i finished it alone it was the worst kids movie i have seen if you want to watch a fun kids movie watch shrek 2 that movie is fun for kids and their parents avoid this movie it isn't funny isn't cute the cat's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label
<START> before this made for tv movie began i had relatively low expectations that's because it was made after the final episode of the series had aired and many of the series originals were gone there is no president sheridan delenn lennier londo vir g'kar or lyta if you remember on the second to last episode of the series all the regulars except zack vir and captain lockley left b 5 permanently now for this film they did bring back garibaldi who was not in the last b 5 movie to join zack and the captain and the doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance but because so much is gone of the old chemistry this film already is severely handicapped br br the movie is about a soul hunter martin sheen who is led to babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist ian mcshane a lot of spooky mumbo jumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless yeah yeah the station nearly blew up but was saved and all but frankly i felt like it was a case of been there done that and done that a lot better in the past br br the secondary plot provided more for comic relief was much more interesting as an entrepreneur installed a holo brothel and those in command weren't sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close they were slapped with a lawsuit this was fluff but it did provide a few laughs something the other dreary plot was surely lacking br br by the way sheen at first did a good job playing the should hunter with his wild eyes and bizarre delivery however repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character this should have been spotted and corrected br br so the final verdict is this is only for total die hard b 5 nuts like myself others seeing it might assume the series sucked which is a great injustice this is a great example of a show not knowing when to quit
<START> this is the best chinese movie i have ever seen and in my opinion a lot better than hero or chrouching tiger hidden dragon the movie is a unique combination of several genres it's a beautiful love story action movie comedy and horror at the same time and the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of this br br this movie definitely makes it to my top 5 and should be enjoyable to every movie lover the action sequences do have the traditional unrealistic jumping and even flying but the way it's shot differs from the style of hero a lot and the flying always looks great and usually even makes sense ghosts can fly br br see this movie you won't regret it 10 10
<START> i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oop's and this one surely is an oop one year after the exorcist she's back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out she never became a mega star that's one of the reason's many of her films are oop she gives a good performance in this movie it's about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn't have any friends played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14 that's funny the movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity in most editions it's cut out why i don't know no blood is involved okay blair is butt naked but nothing is shown no t a so nothing to offend people but the movie is slow extremely slow it doesn't happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep it's just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows no gore no nothing why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me if you're a fan of blair buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is
