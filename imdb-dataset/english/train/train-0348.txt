<START> now i have never ever seen a bad movie in all my years but what is with songs in the movie what physiological meaning does it have wow some demented pokÃ©mon shows up and they multiply i can get a seizure from this animie is pointless the makers of it are pointless its a big marketing scheme look just cut down on songs and they will get a good rating i reckon that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the pokÃ©mon episodes to understand whats going on and it is not a film it is just an animation it should be on video br br ps i'll give it a 1 because i just got 5 bucks i could not give it a half because there's no halves
<START> i've been largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons br br 1 this is without doubt the worst film i've ever seen 2 unless it gets more reviews it will not be listed in the all time worst films list which it deserves to be 3 i was kinda lucky i paid five pound for it i've seen it in shops for 15 pound don not pay that much for this film you will be very angry 4 there are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that are not given a fair rating in my opinion and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminal br br the plot summary a guy with no friends meets a tramp who promises the world well the magic ability to appear to everybody else like somebody else our hero cunningly turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang sitting on swings baby sitting he kills them one by one until he is tracked and found by the police br br why is it so bad to begin with the acting is very very bad someone else compared it to a school production no this is worse than any acting i've seen on a school stage br br i've bought a number of these previously banned films from the dvd company vipco and not been as disappointed as i was at this okay the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in every other sense what was the point in making this film when there isn't even any gore okay no gore what else can a film like this offer breats no not even any titillation br br it's true this film may have a certain charm in its unique naffness but any potential buyer watcher of this film should be fairly advised that this film is at best worth only one out of ten
<START> i want to clarify a few things i am not familiar with ming liang tsai movies and i am very familiar with art cinema i grow up in the seventies times of goddard fellini bergman bertolucci and many others br br art movies then were really art like paints people did it to express their inner feelings not really worried about if other people understand anything they were beyond commercial values just look some old antonioni or early picasso and you will understand br br tian bian yi duo yun the wayward cloud has nothing to do with that it is an opportunistic movie intended to fool festival judges and critics playing many things without saying anything br br the story makes no sense the lack of water makes the government to promote the use of watermelons to hydrate a girl in desperation steal water from the public bathrooms wc there is also a porno start neighbor trying to make a movie with an actress he does not seems to feel comfortable with there is some romantic awakening between the girl and the porno star the mess ends with a sexual scene not pornographic that many people feel shocked about but i believe it is less provocative than you can see in american pie or history of violence br br the two main characters never talk sometimes a musical number 60 style appears and explains through a song what is happening in characters minds these video clips are really welcomed because the previous scene without dialog or music only people looking at each other takes sometimes 4 5 or even more minutes which in movie times is too much br br there is also a few bits about the difficult to make sex without love the selfish mind of the porno industry br br it is obvious this movie intended get away with it to fool festival juries and critics it have a few pseudo shocking scenes within the limits of taiwan censorship and many subjects are open but nothing is concluded or goes anywhere br br these tricks got the movie a few disputed important prices in film festivals and get the movie an undeserved commercial success i see the movie in france and the theater was packed br br however please do not be fooled there is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this movie it is boring and empty really a fraud to public boogie nights which i did not really liked intimacy and 9 songs are far better movies
<START> the original les visiteurs was original hilarious interesting balanced and near perfect lv2 must be a candidate for worst first sequel to a really good film in lv2 everyone keeps shouting when a gag doesn't work first it's repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny lv2 is a horrible parody of lv1 except of course that a parody should be inventive if you loved lv1 just don't see this film just see lv1 again
<START> i rented this film purely on the fact that the cover appealed to me however as soon as the film began i had regrets it seems they used a home video camera to shoot this film and let a young child do it they also used inappropriate ghostly faces and shapes to try and scare people but i found myself laughing i could have put that together myself and done a better job of it br br as for the plot i felt that it had some really good ideas but because of dodgy lines and in some cases acting they were overshadowed it had no direction br br i didn't want to sit through it all because it caused me physical pain to watch it but i always finish what i start so i took a deep breath and let it carry on definitely 98minutes of my life wasted br br i would save yourself the embarrassment of knowing that you have watched 'haunted boat' and find something that is more entertaining i'm a fan of low budget horror films but this was a major disappointment i thought nothing could get worse after 'terror toons' but this made me reconsider a let down to its genre br br out of the star is for the ideas of having their worst fears coming for them
<START> even in a bad film there is usually some redeeming feature something that you can say yes it was terrible but there was that performance or that part of the script or that special effect this was just simply terrible all over the acting was laughable the script terrible complete with many inexplicable breakfast at tiffany's references and even the special effects were shoddy at best this was a very bad film and one that even drew barrymore wishes was expunged from history watch it if you want to a suffer harsh self inflicted pain b see just how bad a film can be this is one film where i can use the clichÃ© there's ninety minutes of my life i will never get back with some justification
<START> the first series of lost kicked off with a bang literally and slowly decreased in pace this may have put some viewers off and people who started to watch halfway through would either be bored or just plain confused br br i would advise people new to the world of lost to simply watch from the beginning and don't get pt off by the slower episodes the acting throughout is excellent but why have 5 series' planned why all this means is that there will be no answers for at least 4 years oh well i'll keep watching if it keeps the tension up and dialogue flowing
<START> not even worth watching this tacky spoiler ruins everything about 'annie' the characters seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline and they low quality feeling to the production it was very clearly made for tv yet if i found it on my television i would flick it straight over the children in the film do an alright job yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in this film lacked the music dance numbers thats made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the annie we all love johnson as annie is at times annoying and over acted you cannot convince yourself that she truly is annie the differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film sad to say this sequel was a total flop
<START> expecting to see a cute little film from mainland china i was ill prepared family dynamics community and the inevitability of change have rarely been explored so expertly on film every character is solid and i was completely drawn into the story the organization is much more complex than american audiences will be accustomed to yet there is no difficulty following the progression even while reading subtitles jiang wu as the retarded brother is a constant shining light leave your cynicism in your locker it will be there when you check out
<START> if there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become this one would take the prize the plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of power seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be br br the acting was bad at best casper van dien wasted his talent doing this film michael york's work was a fair match for the role since he was the center of the film and did a good job br br this plot was sickening and very disturbing no tender or immature minds should see this film this is how a basic good vs evil plot can go astray br br there must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles who look for ways to market this type of junk there must have been something censored out to get a pg 13 rating but it was still awful
<START> was so that i could in good conscience tell everyone how horrible this movie is i barely made it through twenty minutes before i started thinking to myself wow this is pretty bad and to be honest i would've given this movie 1 star if it wasn't for esai morales though he had very little screen time he's the movie's only well acted role which is a shame because i really like gil bellows or at least i thought i did br br while watching this i started thinking back to his part in shawshank redemption and realized it wasn't as good as i thought it was problem his jail house tough guy act seems like it's just that an act his dialogue sounded like he was doing a very poor impression has he ever met someone who speaks like his character was supposed to i doubt it but maybe he should have br br and to make matters worse they've managed to inject a little jail house philosophy and make it seem nothing short of contrived especially when you consider that the rhetoric was being spouted by a rasta who's accent was so strong that it seemed unnatural br br i wouldn't normally slam a movie like this but when i saw the movie it had a fairly favorable review i felt like i was cheated and lied to and i thought i should try to save someone the misery of having to watch this movie br br i say boooooooo
<START> well i'd be lying if i said that this could easily rival spiderman or the batman movies still it was more appealing to me for it's moral value i first bought the vhs when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite my wife and i are avid supporters of robert townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie hollywood shuffle true he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable but his movies are still fun br br meteor man provides a hero with an urban contemporary feel i always felt that if there were superheroes they wouldn't provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics meteor man is realistic hero with real problems car broken into bad neighborhood local drug dealing gangs using children for distribution etc the scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community br br what i found to be truly entertaining outside of james earl jones' young forever performance was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers it wasn't long before they had a full agenda lined up for him without his input of course it was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived br br yes the plot was weak the movie was predictable there was bad acting and continuity was rotten but it ranks 1 with my kids robert townsend works to bring movies home so to speak i doubt he'll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor producer director he truly is but there are and will always be those that love him for his efforts br br one point to ponder about the film which i find amusing throughout the entire battle with simon no one bothered to call the police also what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window my mother would have been right there scrapping by my side toe to toe dad would be loading his pistol lol br br rent it and check it out it's worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of sinbad luther vandross bill cosby big daddy kane etc great job with the cameos robert
<START> at this point it seems almost unnecessary to state that jon bon jovi delivers a firm strong seamless performance as derek bliss his capability as an actor has been previously established by his critical acclaim garnered in other films the leading man no looking back but in case anyone is still wondering yes jon bon jovi can act he can act well and that's come to be expected of him it's easy to separate derek from the guy who belts out hits on vh 1 br br i generally would not watch a horror movie i've come to expect them to focus on sensationalistic gore rather than dialogue and plot what pleased me most about this film was that there really was a viable plot being moved along the gore is not so much as to become the focus of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effects budgets so gore fans might be disappointed but story fans will not br br unlike an action film like u 571 where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bombast we get a chance to know the good guys and actually care what happens to them a few scenes are left unexplained like derek's hallucinations but you get the feeling certain aspects were as they were to lay the foundation for a sequel unfortunately with the lack of interest shown by hollywood in this film that sequel will never happen these few instances are forgiveable knowing that vampires could have been a continuing series br br is this the best film i've ever seen in my life no is it a good way to spend about two hours being entertained yes it won't leave the person who fears horror movies with insomnia and it won't leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed either if you're somewhere in between the horror genre loather and the horror genre lover this film is for you it reaches a happy medium with the effects and story balancing each other br br
<START> half past dead starring steven seagal in the main role was a major b hit half past dead 2 is just a direct to video sequel an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something it's less entertaining than the first one in all aspects but it's although worthy a look if you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session if you also like to watch former wwe stars on screen or even if you love to watch sequels even if they are direct or not br br kurupt did a good job bill goldberg was below the average i think he isn't made to the job kurupt is a good comedian i say the rest did the job but nothing amazing nothing far from alright br br technical details well a production made by sony can't be great cinematography was a disaster but overall direction was acceptable whatever just watch it if you want if you watch you won't lose anything but if you don't well you won't lose either
<START> am i missing something here unexpected plot developments plot twisting with subversive glee are these viewers watching the same arquette vehicle to which i just subjected myself in an now obvious sub un conscious bout of sadomasochism i just joined this site simply to make sure that no one else ever rents this stinker this movie was an embarrassment to every single person involved quick question did sir stevie read the script before he gave the thumbs up to kate c if so then it must be the same spielberg who greenlighted howard the duck don't give me that it was a hit play crap i'm guessing mssr reddin ain't too pleased the dvd cover promised surprising corners and a twisted story story story it's crap like this that make old bobby mckee and his wandering band of structuralists sound like geniuses sundance berlin toronto i have a home video of my cat farting that evokes more interest than arquette's negatively dimensional portrayal of anguished loss and talk about deux ex machina for mr stanley t thank god just in the nick o time he thought to have dave call the cops and thank shiva that the cops had just caught the true killer what up until the credits i was still waiting for it to be some kind of grift against arquette and his hidden millions no mrs spielberg you don't escape unscathed what the hell was that kitchen scene with the athlete's foot in my crotch gag are you worse in this or just cause i dunno hey film lovers why don't you make it a blockbuster night and rent this along with jersey girl and white chicks and then commit sepukka or is it seppuka and take e dunsky with you
<START> br br i take issue with the other reviewer's comments for the simple reason that this is a mystery film not a supernatural one it is not the only film to have a seemingly supernatural explanation vampires but turns out to be a very mundance one br br other films that come to mind are edgar wallace's before dawn and the more famous mark of the vampire br br the film does a wonderful job in creating a very spooky atmosphere similar dracula when renfield meets the count on the staircase of his castle or in mark of the vampire when the two people look thru the windows of the castle ruins and see a corpse playing an organ while luna descends using wings very surreal br br if one likes these often silent atmospheric touches this film is a must br br norm vogel
<START> i had to write a review of this film after reading another comment saying that this is sidney poitier's best movie poitier had just returned from over a decade's break in film acting and he is clearly creaky here 11 of his films are mentioned in wikipedia and they don't include this 5 of his films are on the afi's list of top 100 inspiring movies again not including this berenger and poitier rube and city slicker set out to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before he crosses the border to canada some of the attempts at comedy in this film clearly fail and berenger and poitier's bonding was cringeworthy and awkward not helped by a completely bland script kirstie alley as the hostage was underused and almost entirely ignored when she was on screen some attempt at suspense is made for example when you're meant to try and guess which of 5 men on a fishing trip is the murderer all of them are type cast villains i understand that this is the entire appeal to most fans out there i guessed who it was and i wasn't really trying hard br br if you're a berenger fan watch the sniper 1993 you even get to see billy zane strutting his stuff it's much better all in all i'd give shoot to kill 3 10 it's not daring and it's just too straightforward for me
<START> the only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes other than that this movie is a big dud we have kim basinger the beleaguered housewife slowly meandering thru the local mall for the first 30 min of the movie which added nothing then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with 4 punks who took up 2 parking spaces on this busy xmas eve they begin to chase her after offing the local security guard who tried to help her from there this movie gets worse way worse i know its only a movie and you've gotta go with the flow but she's got about a 5 min headstart and she can't hide or find someone to help her instead she drives to a half built subdivision beside a forest in typical fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily track her but now she turns into one tough mofu you get the point do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type it's so illogical you'll be questioning every scene it is embarrassing for basinger and craig sheffer and the rest of the cast as well as the consumers
<START> there's more to offer in the opening of the odd couple than in the entirety of most films felix unger the poor guy's monogram even curses him checks into a new york hotel a cleaning lady says good night goodbye he answers back in his room he empties his pockets then struggles to take off his wedding ring only to put the objects neatly into an envelope addressed to his wife and beloved children when the viewer finally puts it together Â aha he's going to off himself Â we watch him struggle to open the window Â oh no he's going to jump Â the poor guy injures his lower back this is all you need to know about felix unger Â his wife has left him he's a compulsive cleaner and he's a hypochondriac and all in one scene this is the particular genius of neil simon's comedy Â it's about situation and character there are few obvious physical jokes Â no kicks to the groin no cheap gags Â just funny characters in uncomfortable situations and of course he is a master of manipulating the audience's expectations coming from the swingers era imagine what i thought in the date scene when felix starts lamenting about the breakup of his marriage to the girls his roommate oscar has worked so hard to get into his apartment he's blowing it right think again the girls love his sensitivity his ability to cry in front of them they invite him back to their place since his meatloaf has burned because oscar wasn't paying enough attention to it he's in like flynn right uh yes but he doesn't want to go with the girls because he's feeling vulnerable great stuff and it's made even greater with a style that minimizes editing and maximizes the wonderful eight room apartment set you've got jack lemmon and the slouchy pouchy walter matthau for chrissakes why mess it up the visual style reminded me of breakfast at tiffany's in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various planes of action particularly memorable is the scene in which felix fleeing from oscar closes a partition only to realize the partition doesn't cover the side where oscar is coming from you get a real sense of the layout of the apartment and thus the proximity in which the two divorcÃ©es live the twist here is that these two are really married Â to each other so the observations about married life that might be ignored in an ordinary romantic comedy are made all the more poignant since they are two guys
<START> there are some redeeming qualities to this show one is that the theme tune does have a decent melody the show does have a nice premise also i am probably in the minority but i like wanda i like the fact she is caring and is more a mother figure to timmy however despite all this i do not like this show it isn't excrement but i do find it very annoying br br i wouldn't say that it is the best animated show on planet earth when i use that term for an animated tv show i think of peter pan and the pirates i think of darkwing duck i think of scooby doo and i think of talespin and i hope i am not the only one who really likes the wild thornberrys and resent the fact it gets poked fun at nor do i think fairly odd parents is the worst animated show on planet earth i accept it's annoying and in some ways overrated but it isn't the worst show on nickolodean that is chalk zone god that show is unwatchable but the worst animated show i've ever seen is shaggy and scooby doo get a clue which is crudely animated unfunny and frankly a disgrace br br one thing i don't like about this show is the animation the characters forgive me if i offend have very weird facial features and a lot of the backgrounds are dull and lack the colour that make spongebob squarepants and wild thornberrys so nice to look at the characters with the exception of wanda i find very annoying i can't believe such a talented voice actress like tara strong aka charendoff voiced timmy timmy i don't find very likable as a lead character at all he is annoying and sometimes patronising and he is a poor decision maker as well and his voice gets on my nerves i actually like strong but not in this show another annoying character is cosmo the supposedly funny character instead his jokes are as unfunny as they could become they are either a contrived or b over familiar timmy's parents are awful characters who don't give a toss about their son and their personalities wear well thin br br the story lines are very unoriginal on the most part and i keep thinking where have i seen this before the episodes after the arrival of the baby i thought were unwatchable even worse is the scripts very unfunny childish witless and suffer from a complete lack of energy br br all in all not the worst show ever but pretty poor for an animation fan and fairly uncomfortable to sit through 3 10 there are redeeming qualities and i completely understand if people like it bethany cox
