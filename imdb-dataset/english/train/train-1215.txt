<START> i thought king solomon's mines was beautifully done my only reservation was alison doody her acting was superb but her makeup and hair was not of the period and always seemed to make her look out of place next to the other actors i thought patrick swayze was an excellent choice for alan quatermain it was nice seeing a seasoned rugged looking actor in this role after sitting through movie after movie with the fair haired fair skinned actors like val kilmer brad pitt etc he was an excellent choice and i enjoyed every minute of this movie this version cannot be compared with the 1950's version with stewart grainger it was a big screen movie and not a made for tv movie i thought both quatermains were believable but the two medias have to be kept separated i am looking forward to seeing this once more and i hope patrick swayze will again look to these type of roles
<START> never viewed this film and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors in the period that this film was made people in america were different there was no tv or all the modern things we have today except the radio and the starting out of great films being made in hollywood sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today ann shirley murder my sweet '44 played a young orphan gal who was called carrot top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks who were like two wise owls and watched over ann shirley it was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened the entire town found out about it within minutes it is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living today it seems very corn ball and stupid but believe me this was the way people were in america during the 1920' 30's and they were a great generation that loved good family films
<START> this was one of those films that got a ton of play on the airwaves in the early 1970's usually on the 4am movie or one time on the 7 30 pm channel 6 big movie and still another on creature double feature when local channels used to run movies as part of their local programming mostly gone today in favor of infomercial time it was of the time a couple of low rent abbott and costello wannabees frankie ray and robert ball are in a platoon of soldiers half a dozen guys in army surplus remainders who are sent on field maneuvers to look into some strange radiation and wind up encountering extraterrestrials they first go into bronson canyon to what would be later the famous batcave on batman and encounter the remains of a dead carrot monster later in the cave they're chased by a living carrot creature basically a guy in black suit and paper mache head with sparkly things on it and ping pong ball eyes two of them complete geeks ray and ball are captured and wake up tied to tables and are being examined by space amazons dr poona nooo kidding and professor tanga who are stunningly beautiful and even moreso in their skimpy bikini uniforms we were too young at the time to realize what later bondage and fetish scenarios this examination scene would more than suggest turns out that the two gals and their carrot monster are stranded on earth with a ship that's well hidden and are trying to return to their world br br the film was made as a total comedy with varying degrees of taste but remember this was of the time when eric von zipper and his crew from frankie and annette's films were the height of b film drive in comedy so it only seemed a natural to jump on the bandwagon for some quick bucks br br for some reason i only thought i'd imagined seeing this film to start with no i really saw it and when it was released on restored dvd i was assured in my memory the comedy goes from mildly funny to just plain stupid but whatever the budget is non existent which is a minor miracle when you think about it that it even got made and we can talk about a restored version here and now over 40 years later the payoff is the girls who want to learn about love and kissing and the upshot is the geeks which all of us were get the girls and love wins out it's just goofy and silly and for the locations has nostalgic significance
<START> this film sat on my tivo for weeks before i watched it i dreaded a self indulgent yuppie flick about relationships gone bad i was wrong this was an engrossing excursion into the screwed up libidos of new yorkers br br the format is the same as max ophuls' la ronde based on a play by arthur schnitzler who is given an inspired by credit it starts from one person a prostitute standing on a street corner in brooklyn she is picked up by a home contractor who has sex with her on the hood of a car but can't come he refuses to pay her when he's off peeing she answers his cell phone and takes a message she runs away with his keys br br then the story switches to the contractor who pays a professional call on a rich bored new york woman who plays with him until he is aroused then she pulls away she tells him how desperate and unhappy she is he tells her how beautiful she is and lucky as he is leaving she asks if he would have sex with her she sits on top of him bounces up and down this time he comes the he leaves br br the woman and her husband throw a dinner party for their trendy friends hubby robert is talking business wife ellen is bored and switches the subject to sex and how often men and women think about it husband switches conversation to desert later after the guests leave ellen tries to entice robert into sex robert wants none of it and puts on a jazz record ellen turns on the radio robert turns up the music ellen turns on the tv robert turns on another tv cacophony ensues ellen goes up on the roof robert joins her ellen confesses that she needs to experience more men men other than robert robert says that he too needs to experience men br br we next follow robert as he visits an artist martin played by steve buscemi i wish buscemi could have more roles like this where he is a sexy smart totally desirable guy robert praises martin's work much more than it deserves promises to get it into a show martin is excited until it turns out that robert is speaking out of his groin it is all a mating dance robert tries to kiss martin on the lips and martin pulls back saying that he is not gay robert asserts that he's not gay either martin scoffs both admit that the artworks are bad robert is about to leave when martin allows robert to kiss him they make out and robert goes down on martin br br next we follow martin as he prepares for an art show at a manhattan gallery he is smitten by the receptionist anna played by rosario dawson i had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1000 words and they make love to each other br br we next follow anna who is sitting at a lunch stand her boyfriend nick adrian grenier enters bearing flowers she is cold toward him he tries to figure out why he coaxes out of her the information that she has had sex with someone while he was in san francisco she coaxes out of him the fact that he has stayed with his ex gf while in san francisco and had sex with her the latter revelation turns out to be a lie the two of them make out in the luncheonette but she decides that they must break up nick is heartbroken br br and we follow nick who confesses his troubles to an older woman who he meets on a park bench joey carol kane joey is sort of weird and child like but is a good audience for nick who needs a sympathetic ear the two of them go to coney island at night and look at the stars nick falls under joey's spell despite the age difference between them they go back to joey's apartment and nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman she is on top of him doesn't want to let him go but he manages to escape br br this is by the way the best carol kane role since she played latke's wife in taxi joey's phone rings and it is a man calling the psychic friends network and joey is one of the psychic friends although she is still hurting from nick she gradually gets into her psychic shtick the man is at his office late at night and wants to have phone sex with her although that is not joey's business joey goes along and coaxes the man to come she wants to keep talking although the man want to get off the phone and finds out that he has embezzled a lot of money from his company and will be found out tomorrow his life is ruined joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend that she cares about him and she does care about him br br but the man packs a gun into his briefcase and goes off to seek a prostitute on the brooklyn waterfront and we come back to the beginning to the same prostitute who started out la ronde she wants to give him 75 000 in cash if she will kill him he tried to kill himself but couldn't do it the prostitute does not want to do it but he insists holding her hand holding the gun inside his mouth telling her where to aim eventually the gun goes off and we see the prostitute walking down the street and arriving at the corner where she normally does business the contractor who didn't pay her earlier in the movie drives up rolls down the window they look at each other the end
<START> i don't know what would be so great about this movie even worse why should anyone bother seeing this one first of all there is no story one could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling laughter cry fear but in my opinion this movie does not do that either br br you are just watching images for 2 hrs there are more useful things to do br br i guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above but is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 eur of your money for me the answer is no
<START> i must say that i really had no idea that i was going to sit down and watch this movie i guess it was the fact that i had nothing better to do between class but for once a tv movie caught my interest more importantly helen hunt caught my eye i really wasn't a big fan of hers prior to this film sure i liked twister and as good as it gets but something about this movie really did it for me i would now see myself as a huge fan this movie comes with high marks from me give it a chance it won't let you down
<START> the film begins with a bunch of kids in reform school and focuses on a kid named 'gabe' who has apparently worked hard to earn his parole gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon gabe meets up with the dead end kids the kids in this film are little punks but they are much less antisocial than they'd been in other previous films and down deep they are well meaning punks however in this neighborhood there are also some criminals who are perpetrating insurance fraud through arson and see gabe as a convenient scapegoat after all he'd been to reform school and no one would believe he was innocent once he was framed so when gabe is about ready to be sent back to the big house it's up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real crooks br br the dead end kids appeared in several warner brothers films in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good particularly angels with dirty faces however after the boys' contracts expired they went on to monogram studios and the films to put it charitably were very weak and formulaic with huntz hall and leo gorcey being pretty much the whole show and the group being renamed the bowery boys because angels wash their faces had the excellent writing and production values and hall and gorcey were not constantly mugging for the camera it's a pretty good film and almost earns a score of 7 it's real close in fact while this isn't a great film aesthetically it's sure a lot of fun to watch so i will give it a 7 sure it was a tad hokey particularly towards the end when the kids take the law into their own hands and reagan ignores the bill of rights but it was also quite entertaining the dead end kids are doing their best performances and ronald reagan and ann sheridan provided excellent support sure this part of the film was illogical and impossible but somehow it was still funny and rather charming so if you can suspend disbelief it works well
<START> a recent viewing of that's entertainment has given me the urge to watch many of the classic mgm musicals from the forties and fifties anchors aweigh is certainly a lesser film than on the town the songs aren't as good nor is the chemistry between the characters but the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites such as tchaikovsky and the scene at the hollywood bowl with sinatra and kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top and then running down the steps while dozens of pianists play on the piano is the best scene in the film even though the scene in which kelly dances with jerry mouse is more famous classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing sinatra then croons i fall in love too easily before having his epiphany about whom he loves the color is beautiful hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution free air can you imagine hollywood in the twenties let alone the mid 1940s and the piano music is absolutely glorious mgm certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these
<START> this movie is nothing short of a dark gritty masterpiece i may be bias as the apartheid era is an area i've always felt for but i'd say it ranks right up with cry freedom and cry the beloved country sadly up until a few days ago i'd never even heard of this movie inside is one of the most underrated films of all time probably because it was a small film company i'd never even heard of it before eric stoltz one of my favorite actors anyway is believable and dramatic nigel hawthorne plays his dastardly role well do not look for humor in this film there is none it is real savage and gritty to the last and to the sensitive i'd say bring a box of tissues but movies as great as this make you wonder why is it that the greatest films are often never heard of
<START> dvd has become the equivalent of the old late night double bill circuit the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like the border there were great expectations for this back in 1982 Â a script co written by the wild bunch's walon green jack nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast harvey keitel warren oates valerie perrine tony richardson directing although he was pretty much a spent force by then Â but now it doesn't even turn up on tv the material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s american dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption with nicholson's border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wife's relentless materialism until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business unfortunately he never really gets his hands dirty barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface the film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and sadly the recent dvd release is a missed opportunity to restore the original nihilistic ending where nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the film's trailers br br while that probably wasn't too convincing considering how low key nicholson's crisis of conscience is in the film it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity at one point he's holding characters at gunpoint then he's somewhere else and they're free trying to kill him one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the rio grande while valerie perrine's character gets dumber on an exponential level the villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease and one impressive car stunt in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely what makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring unfortunately ry cooder's beautiful title song across the borderline says it all much more economically but if you want to know the film's real crime it's completely wasting the great warren oates in a nothing bit part when even he can't make an impression you know something's really wrong all in all all too easy to remember why i found this so forgettable at the time
<START> recently a friend and i were discussing educational and ethical influences when we were growing up in the 1950's versus today she mentioned samuel taylor coleridge who in 1798 wrote the rime of the ancient mariner both of us had been required to recite parts of the epic poem in high school and in english literature courses in college my friend said its messages even might be called metaphysical within today's context br br we tried reciting it and only remembered bits and pieces i have problems remembering dr seuss i said i'd get two copies of the poem so each could read it that was easy enough but i was extremely surprised to find it had been made into a film we looked forward to watching the film to see how it had been interpreted after all the rime of the ancient mariner isn't exactly light reading after each had read the poem we watched the film together br br we considered the film a remarkable achievement especially considering it was made in the 1970's before computers before the so called ken burns effect and before special effects too often began compensating for a lack of substance particularly noteworthy are the 19th and 20th century illustrations culled from lesser known artists such as willy pogany the early hollywood designer br br the film is narrated by sir michael redgrave whom had taught the poem when he was a schoolmaster adding a tone of authority and credibility in remaining true to the poem br br its mastery is in the layers of subtle messages conveyed without instructing or becoming an oppressive and obvious morality tale we found it such a refreshing change from today's 'in your face' and 'clobber them over the head' mentality most of today's morality messages in film are two dimensional extreme violence murder and mayhem mark the bad the bad are really really bad and good are super heroes it is as if human character lacked any nuance the rime of the ancient mariner is a celebration of the individual of character of an appreciation for celebrating all the richness life has to offer within the larger context of humanity i e man's capacity to give to others br br proud of ourselves for having found this unknown gem we then learned it had won the top award in its category five out of six times at name international film festivals another surprise was learning the film's director raul dasilva is a recognized authority on early animation and authored six award winning books about film br br this film's message is just as relevant today if not more so than when coleridge penned the original epic poem and when raul dasilva translated it to film if i still was teaching high school which i did for five years i'd grab this one and show it to all my students there's a level of richness here that naturally leads to discussion about the big and important issues all of us face whether in 1798 1978 or today in fact as long as humanity has a spiritual component br br highly recommended
<START> the story would never win awards but that's not what it's about the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scenes who needs a story with fighting like that really it's worth watching for that reason alone if you can handle the gore of which there is a lot none of it done realistically enough to be tough to look at i gave it a 7
<START> it is a pleasure to see such creativity on tv again this show is poetic artistic and good fun the characters relate well and the writing is not bad i think it will improve as they get their legs definitely worth a look br br the girls steal the show so far in this series chuck is adorable as is olive the two aunts are a delight i sincerely hope they write them into bigger parts as they are magic br br well that's all the news that is fit to print go make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in an old fashioned way this is like dr seuss for adults
<START> very slow paced but intricately structured and ultimately very touching a nice very true to life look at a small florida beach town in the dead of winter i've been there and this is absolutely accurate br br it's also the debut feature of actress ashley judd and she makes a big impression here it's hard to believe this film is 12 years old i remember seeing it in theaters and i recently rented ruby again except for the 80's looking clothes it has held up very nicely ashely is so radiant and touching here that it's hard to think of her subsequent career without wincing boy talk about failing to fulfill your early promise anyone seeing ashley here in ruby in paradise would assume this elegant natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting instead she has become the go to girl for dumb action films and slasher movies very disappointing but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to showcase her early promise br br as some other commenter's say this is not for everyone as it's very slow paced this is not an action film nor is it really a romance the director victor nunez ulees gold another excellent character study treats this ordinary young woman's life with deep respect allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail in that way i think this is one of the most moving and respectful coming of age stories about young women that i can recall it's not about ruby's sexual awakening or how she lost her virginity but about her life choices and her growing maturity br br a lovely film if you take the time to watch it i think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls or boys for that matter and give them a chance to think about and discuss it br br particular kudos to director nunez who also wrote the script which is so realistic and nicely detailed that i assumed all through the movie that it was based on a female written novel or memoir but in fact it's mr nunez's original work rated 8 out of 10
<START> paulie sounds like the most saccharine lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find yet it's actually much better than you might expect the daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film but actually in most other departments the film is charming br br in case you're wondering paulie is a parrot bought for a little girl with speech difficulties paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her he even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons and eventually becomes a super intelligent speaker himself however paulie is sent away by the little girl's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from n y c to l a to be re united with her br br so why does this awful sounding film succeed relatively well firstly it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects secondly and far more significantly it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline thirdly it has several surprisingly strong performances including jay mohr as a wily crook gena rowlands as a kind old lady and cheech marin yes the dope smoking cheech marin as a musical immigrant it might not be a classic but paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages
<START> in this documentary we meet roger the rich manager of a factory in china that makes beads and other trinkets sold and traded at mardi gras in new orleans roger claims the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it provides but interviews with four of them tell quite another story the girls' bleak lives are shown in stark contrast to the bizarre excesses of mardi gras itself filmmaker david redmon should be lauded for getting excellent and rare footage of everyday life inside a chinese factory compound and for landing a revealing on camera interview with the head of the u s company that imports and sells the beads the movie is compellingly told and clearly serves its purpose as a window into what lies behind those ubiquitous made in china labels
<START> well i'm blowed a woody allen film that i walked out of after half an hour i'm aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a film of which i've seen less than half but i hope you'll understand why basically it became apparent very early on that we were going to be patronised from the screen with a script that set out its conceit as if with bullet points a cast that were all trying to be characters from hannah and her sisters with the exception of chloe sevigny and were badly directed into doing so and a camera that sat around portentously only for there to be nothing to film but chat and the actor delivering it drama none it's partially pre narrated but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation br br maybe i did leave too early in this case but by then i'd decided against another hour and a half of one liner allen clones the script has its funny moments Â i went almost entirely on the back of will ferrell's excerpts in the trailer trailer hooked again doh Â but there's little pace to let them fly off nonchalantly as is best worse than this there's no fluidity saying this film's wooden makes a forest look like a jelly the opening cafÃ© bound discussion being the most abject case in point the only thing that should be done by numbers is potted reviewing Â 2 10
<START> you know this is gonna be a cheesy movie when br br 1 it was made it the 50's 2 it's in black and white 3 it has no name actors 4 screaming makes up for the lack of special effects br br well not to be outdone this movie brilliantly incorporated all four of the above elements to turn this into a true cinematic blunder br br okay shhhhh but i am gonna discuss special effects here or lack of them br br did you catch the underwater scenes it looks like it was poorly filmed through an aquarium note the cape flapping in the breeze br br and the repeated re use of stock footage exterior house shots the bridges scenes great enhanced the k r a f tiness of this film not since plan 9 have i seen such creative usage of stock footage br br and hey where there was a lack of special effects not to worry screaming does take the place of special effects in this movie as well yes this movie even cleverly used that old hack trick br br grab the popcorn set your brain on stun several fermented beverages definitely helps sit back and wonder why the heck did they put this on film again br br wayno br br
<START> emma is a true romance if you love the soppy stuff charged with wit and folly you will love this movie its true to the novel which is very important with a few twists added for pleasure gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades she shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to br br jeremy northam as the hero how shocked are you i never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck what the right role can do for you he looks so good as the sensible regal mr k that i am literally looking at him in a new light he makes and excellent romantic lead the charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful br br ewan mcgregor greta sacchi brings in the rest a good cast a good movie if you are a fan of jane austen see this movie along with pride and prejudice and most importantly buy the books it enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary
<START> i discovered this movie on ifc and i thought it would be interesting for tiny love stories some of the stories really dragged on in this movie the fact that none of these women had names almost makes you suspect that the actresses were talking about their own real sex lives including kathy baker and alicia witt i have to admit i want to start seeing some more romantic views of first sexual encounters again like in strike 1998 when odette sinclair's acquaintances started asking about her presumed first time and tweety asked was it beautiful br br some might think re enactments and flashbacks would improve this movie i think it would make things even worse it doesn't necessarily have to be hardcore porn to get my attention but somehow i just expected more
