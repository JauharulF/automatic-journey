<START> shinjuku triad society chinese mafia wars is unlikely to get distribution in the west outside film festivals why could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk and the victims enjoy it or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull these are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story it makes clockwork orange which was banned for years in the uk look like a disney cartoon br br should you see this film yes it is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of asian cinema the shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters if you like this make sure you catch dead or alive which is very similar barring the insane ending in doa of course great for japan that they have a talent like miike working at the same time as takeshi kitano the best chance of seeing this film outside a takashi miike retrospective at a film festival is on dvd if i haven't put you off try hunting for a hong kong version on the web as i'm sure it will come out in that country
<START> the acting in this movie stinks the plot makes very little sense but from what i gathered it's supposed to be about this scientist who develops the ability to turn people's personal items into tiny steel balls that then fly into their mouths and turn them into zombies or blow their heads up whichever and the effects are lousy too most of the movie consists of bad music with the actors dancing equally as badly to the bad music interspersed with multiple boring sex scenes this should be one of the worst things ever made but for one thing one element of shear brilliance that makes nightmare weekend stand above all others and that special quality is the presence of george br br george is the lovable interface device between the scientist's daughter jessica and the home computer security system with his green hair and nose balding scalp and heart shaped mouth george is the guardian angel confidant to jessica who asks him for advice on how to meet guys in one of the most dramatic pieces of dialogue ever captured on celluloid with his monotone synthesized voice george tells jessica what percentages of males prefer women in white dresses and also that hitch hiking is the third best way to meet guys after discos and bars of course little jessica just can't seem to stay out of trouble causing george to execute emergency program code protection jessica which results in the violent death of jessica's would be assailant via one of the aforementioned steel balls br br kubrick was an utter fool for thinking he could give a computer personality using closeups of a red light hal should have been represented by our friend george in order to better translate compassion for his eventual demise the light and sound show at the end of close encounters not bad but how much better would that movie had been if the means of first communication with the aliens had been george the hand puppet bishop data r2 Â kitchen appliances next to the almighty george he might only be in the movie for 8 minutes out of 90 but don't be fooled this show is all about george with even that limited amount of screentime george joins the ranks of such luminous film characters as hollywood montrose majai and pappy from new moon rising as icons of american cinema george to apache Â you are my hero
<START> kudos to cesar montano for reviving the cebuano movie panaghoy sa suba is very good it has the drama the action the romance and scene that will make you laugh br br while the story is not that original a love triangle or make a four cornered love japanese occupation rebellion american as lord its presentation is something cool especially it uses it original language bisaya for the filipino nipongo for the japanese and english for the american br br this movie will go as one of this year's best pinoy movies br br go watch this
<START> hello mary lou prom night ii starts at the hamilton high school prom of 1957 where mary lou maloney lisa schrage is cheating on her date bill nordham steve atkinson with bud cooper robert lewis bill finds out is devastated meanwhile mary lou is announced prom queen 1957 takes to the stage to accept her award bill still hurting decides to play a practical joke on mary lou so he throws a firecracker on stage but the still lit fuse catches mary lou's dress setting it her on fire within seconds mary lou is toast 30 years later hamilton high is soon to hold it's annual prom night bill micheal ironside is now the principal has a teenage son named craig justin louis who is dating vicki carpenter wendy lyon are both planning on going to the prom together bud richard monette is now a priest that terrible night 30 years ago still haunt both bill bud one day vicki is looking around the schools basement when she discovers a large trunk which she opens this turns out to be a bad move as the vengeful spirit of mary lou is set free is intent on claiming her crown as prom queen in her spare time sets out to avenge her untimely death first up is jess browning beth gondek whose death is put down to a suicide mary lou begins to posses vicki's body as the night of the prom draws nearer after disposing of some competition in the shape of kelly hennenlotter terri hawkes who tries to fix the prom so she wins mary lou in vicki's body is crowned hamilton high prom queen which allows mary lou herself to come back from the dead to make an unexpected appearance really liven the party up br br with absolutely no connection to the original prom night 1980 directed by bruce pittman i thought hello mary lou prom night ii wasn't a particularly good film the script by ron oliver concentrates more on supernatural elements rather than cheap teen slasher themes whether this was a good or bad decision will depend on your expectations i suppose personally i found these different elements didn't really gel or work that well together at all the whole film was far to slow to be really enjoyable after the opening sequence where mary lou dies no one else is killed until the half hour mark then the film plods along for another half an hour until vicki is finally possessed the film finally picks up momentum for the climax where an evil mary lou kills a whole one person at the prom before she is supposedly defeated come on horror film fans you did expect that clichÃ©d 'killer not dead ready for a sequel' ending didn't you don't expect a hight body count just five throughout the entire film none particularly graphic although i did like the way monica beverley hendry as beverly hendry tried to hide in a shower room locker which mary lou crushed resulting in poor monica's blood oozing out the supernatural side of hello mary lou prom night ii is depicted by vicki having lots of hallucinations for the first hour mary lou controlling objects during the latter stages including a couple of creepy shots of a rocking horse which comes to life the blackboard scene is quite good as well as it turns into water zombie hands drag vicki into it the slasher side of hello mary lou prom night ii isn't outstanding i did like mary lou herself as she churns out the obligatory one liners she made for a good villain even if she didn't get to kill enough people oh yes i did get the running homages to various other horror film director's with almost all of the character's sharing last names with one this obviously adds nothing to the film but is a nice little touch i suppose the acting is ok but the normally dependable micheal ironside looks lost uninterested almost as if he's asking himself what he's doing in this if he'll ever work again forget about any gore someone is hanged there is a stabbing with a crucifix that happens off screen someone is impaled with a neon light a computer goes crazy electrocutes someones face mary lou bursts out of vicki's body at first as a rotting zombie which was quite a cool scene there are some full frontal nudity shots in the girls shower as well if that's your thing to give it some credit hello mary lou prom night ii is ok to watch has reasonable production values throughout is generally well made overall i was disappointed by hello mary lou prom night ii it was just too slow ultimately uneventful to maintain my interest for nearly 100 minutes i'm not sure whether it deserves a 3 or 4 star rating i'll give it a 4 as there's nothing specifically wrong with it i suppose i've sat through much worse films but it just didn't really do anything for me i'm afraid
<START> the best film about marriage and family this is a very interesting reflections to the couples that will be come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family this decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and the life of our kids the real intrusion or help of 'friends' or executioner if we leave the real role of families they can help or they can destroy us the mad priest who possibly is not much mad telling what could happen according the statistics and the reality a couple who thinks in a 'special' marriage live a painful story in their future own history br br who likes contract marriage nobody after the priest tells their own historyÂ if they leave the future in another hands if they don't know what is the marriage that the problems are true that the life demand a real engage guaranties from each one that the real victims of the divorce are kids with real name Âandrea in the film or names that the abortion is only an easy exit sadness regrets and unhappiness will be there after abortion that the state and social security thinks every time less in a real problems of the families the gossip of the 'friends' the infidelity because of weakness and desperation of steffania because tomasso lives his life as if he were alone br br maybe someone could think that this film is a pessimistic film but not steffania and tomasso in the deep of their hearts they like a beautiful marriage and family if not why they like marriage a truly and beautiful marriage depends only of the couple of each one of their decisions of each one actions in their lives the family could be a place where each one feel loved because being his or her only by existing the screenplay is wonderful the performances are great steffania and tomasso Â¡the almost cynical priest an excellent direction and script the colors and the management of the cameras superb
<START> most complaints i've heard of this film really come down to one thing it isn't versus yes the cast and crew is basically the same yes kitamura rehashes a few shots in the fight scenes that come in the film's second half but that's about where the similarities end versus takes place essentially all outside showcasing kitamura's ability to craft an interesting b movie in natural locations for alive almost everything takes place inside in small cramped spaces here the art design is thrust into your face and what art design it is we are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces and our characters are for the most part confined to those spaces also a key difference is that we don't get much action here until the end of the film versus was all about action and cool here a lot more emphasis is put on characters and situation and messing with your mind because of this alive is a far more interesting film than versus you may not pop it in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cool zombie bloodshed but you will sit glued to the screen for nearly two hours watching he interaction of a few genuinely interesting characters br br i'm now ecstatic that i ordered the dvd despite some naysay you should too but be sure to realize this is a different animal from versus it's often slow and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it i hope media blasters picks it up for subtitled r1 dvd release
<START> i saw this film at the taos film festival last year and was just overwhelmed by it it's a rich warm novel brought to the screen beautifully acted and well directed more than anything it reminded me of the films of david lean both in its ability to handle a complex story and its knack for creating powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels the best movie i've seen in years
<START> following the disasterous revolution this film was pretty much the final nail in the coffin of goldcrest and thus the british film industry the film is absolute pants it's full of music from the attempted mid 80's jazz revival and based on a book author that was briefly popular at that time and has deservedly sank back into obscurity temple searched for ages trying to find suzette and came up with 8th wonders patsy kensett another person who was briefly popular at the time by the time the film came out of post production the jazz revival was over as was kensett's career and the film met a totally uncaring film public br br mediocre would be an overstatement for some of the worst campest cheesiest acting to ever grace the british silver screen watching it almost 20 years on and the film is truely cringeworthy
<START> this tv movie goes to show that bad films do exist the only reason i saw this was it was covered on a ktma mst3k it's super bowl at the superdome in new orleans however no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing with the many stars in this film it made no difference i really don't know why i watched this
<START> normally when i write a review for a movie online it is for one of three reasons either i have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent i feel that the public's perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons or i believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers while all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative i find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as this is one of the best films of all time does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good which should be the point of the review in the first place with that being said war of the worlds is nothing more than a hurried incompetent attempt at a money grab piggy backing its loathsome carcass on the multi million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject this movie is not even so bad that it becomes funny or endearing rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger now with most of the insults out of the way allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than i br br judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film i found it as sam's club for 8 bucks i assumed that the cast would be no names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular check this is not a big deal for me as i find a large budget and an over reliance on big name stars and se can diminish an otherwise decent movie i also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score check again what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien battle scenes br br now as per imdb's policy any spoilers must be announced in advance no matter how small so here is fair warning the movie opens with a lot of inane small talk followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot seriously it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth but by the end of the first ten minutes the combination of shaky camera work spliced scenes and a lot of walking begin to frustrate the viewer however the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going the next 30 minutes basically go as follows one of the main characters walks to one of the pods he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot they both walk back to town these walks aren't two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie in a particularly grueling scene the main character is shown looking at a pod then he is shown pacing and panting then he looks at the pod then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town then comes in to town and walks into a building then he has a cup of coffee and says thank you mary to a random maid that serves him coffee then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod i apologize for the extreme run on sentence but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film characters speak way too long about mundane things they walk a lot they send other people to walk the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed but for no dramatic effect simply the camera man is a sophomore at tech somewhere the editing is mind bogglingly bad people actions make little sense for instance when the professor goes to a farmer's house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town the farmer stutters and paces around when the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion i have seen better high school video productions finally the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage however it is so awful in technical aspects and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad avoid this film at all costs
<START> this group of english pros are a pleasure to watch the supporting cast could form a series of their own it's a seen before love tiangle between the head of surgery his wife and a new pretty boy surgery resident only the superior acting skills of francesca annis michael kitchen and the sexy robson greene lift this from the trash category to a very enjoyable romp the only quibble is that it's hard to accept that the smoldering francesca annis would fall in love and actually marry michael kitchen who like me is hardly an international or even a british sex symbol you can readily understand why robson green would light her fire with apologies to the doors the guy who almost steals the show with a great laid back performance is owen's father david bradley watch him in the way we live now in a completely different performance to get an idea of his range daniela nardini as kitchen's secretary sometime sex toy is hard to forget as the spurned mistress who makes kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body conor mullen and julian rhind tutt as green's sidekick surgery buddies as i've said could have their own series they are that good the whole thing is a great deal of fun and i heartily recommend it and thank you imdbman for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating venue
<START> i got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this film br br as it's obvious that those people who criticized the movie never seen it or were stupid enough to pay to see it br br the best reason to watch was on the elvira show a few years back elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one can br br it's an ok monster flick compared to the hundreds of horrendous american flicks made way better
<START> i'm glad i rented this movie for one reason its shortcomings made me want to read allende's book and get the full story br br pros the movie is beautiful the period is depicted well and consistently to the best of my knowledge and meryl and glenn do good jobs br br cons this is the worst acting job i've ever seen from jeremy irons i kept wondering if something was wrong with his mouth and i hate the terribly english way he says transito winona ryder does nothing believable except look young and idealistic most of the other performances are ok but so few things hang together in the character arcs and the relationship development that i was frustrated and angry well before the end br br i'm very curious now whether this movie is typical of bille august's work i may have to drop another couple of bucks to rent smilla's sense of snow
<START> as usual i went to watch this movie for a r rahman otherwise the film is no good rajni wanted to end his movie career with this film is it would be successful but fortunately or unfortunately the film was a failure after this he delivered a hit with chandramukhi i am eagerly waiting for his forth coming shivaji br br i have read the other user's comment on rajni i found it interesting as the user is from tn too rajni is one actor who acts i think from his heart not from his mind he is not a method actor like kamal hasan i think we need to appreciate rajni for his strong going at his age br br any ways i need to fill 10 lines for this comment so wish u good luck rajni
<START> new best friend is another entry in the steal another woman's life sub genre the best of which are single white female and the hand that rocks the cradle the worse of which you can catch almost any afternoon on the lifetime channel for some reason this type of identity theft happens exclusively to women br br there are just two basic ways to play this type of story you can make the woman evil at the beginning and let the audience watch knowingly as she hatches and implements her evil scheme or you use misdirection to make her appear a good person as a seemingly unplanned series of events break in her favor until she is revealed to be evil in the climatic scene unfortunately the makers of new best friend could not decide how they wanted to play it and things crash and burn early we first meet alicia mia kirshner scamming the college's financial aid office for scholarship money we now know that she is a bad person and will view all her subsequent activity with suspicion but the director and editor apparently forgot that this revelation had been made and spend the next 50 minutes laying misdirection to make us think that alicia is a good person this introduces the only element of suspense not about whether she is evil but about when the director and editor will wise up and stop wasting our time with transparent misdirection br br new best friend suffers more than most from the teen movie curse of a cast too old to be portraying undergraduate students there are really only two big parts hadley meredith monroe and alicia kirshner they were 31 and 26 respectively at the time of the production it almost works for the 26 year old kirshner when she plays the mousy version of alicia but it becomes glaring when she is transformed into the glamed up version of alicia monroe's casting is simply a joke about like having nicholette sheridan try to pass as a classmate on lizzie mcgwire she looks much closer to a mid life crisis than to a term paper br br the producers must have owed a lot of favors because this age issue extends to most of the supporting characters taye diggs who plays the town sheriff is younger than most of the students br br the basic setup is that hadley and two other rich party girls played by dominque swain age 21 and rachel true age 35 are undergrad roommates at college they share as their student residence a mansion that is nicer and better furnished than the mansion on real world new orleans a premise more believable than soccer moms playing students alicia moves into the mansion and begins to take over hadley's life at least that way swain finally gets a roommate from her own generation so the two can have a lesbian scene swain's supporting performance is the only good thing about new best friend and her love scene with kirshner is fantastic so cool and artsy that it doesn't fit with any of the other segments maybe it was subcontracted out to a good director and cinematographer br br the unintentionally hilarious story is presented in a series of dreary flashbacks of rampant sex and nonstop parties each proceeded by a shot of a comatose alicia in a hospital bed about half of kirshner's screen time is spent lying motionless with a tube in her mouth not a good career move mia br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> this episode apparently grew out of the cold war there has been a holocaust but somehow elizabeth montgomery and charles bronson have come through unscathed it then becomes a battle for turf she is attracted to him and vice versa but the instinct for survival takes over it's a quiet slow moving chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust they come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again of course the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive but it still is captivating and interesting because she doesn't speak we don't know here mind very well but in the end we can guess
<START> johny to makes here one of his best style exercises making a strong film with a good yakuza's story the election of the new yakuza's boss is the beginning of a war inside the organization br br in my opinion the violence is wise used in the context making a very strong gangs film i specially love the way he tells the history moving around all the roles inside the yakuza's family and making that we see the violence like the only way they have to solve their problems br br talking about the technical aspects the film is a good example of paused rythmic and planified way of shooting a film one of the hong kong films of the year is like infernal affairs but without the easy action violence scenes and the confused storyline strongly recommended to all asian films lovers br br sorry for my english better do in spanish lol
<START> having watched 10 minutes of this movie i was bewildered having watched 30 minutes my toes were curling i simply couldn't believe it the movie is really awful in fact it is so awful that i had to watch all of it just to be convinced during this i came to realize that it reminded me of a bunch of danish so called comedies from the 60's and 70's the pattern is as follows take one extremely popular comedian make a script putting this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible add a bunch of jokes especially one liners and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young girls film that and you have a success i wouldn't know if this movie was a success but unlike the danish tradition which died quietly with a few great comedians it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the us
<START> for quite a long time in my life i either did not like this film or i liked this film but not as much as many more i watched it recently at a sleepover funnily enough and i liked it more than i had done since i was under 6 or something i now appreciate it more as i do with a few other disney classics that i have watched recently including sleeping beauty and pinnochio or however you spell it br br i now very much appreciate the animation the clever disney plot turns the humour from the mice the emotions expressed and the plot the animation is very well done often it seems you are wherever the other characters are watching them the animation also does well portraying the styles of the backgrounds including the town which is shown twice briefly disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way injecting clever plot turns such as the mice making the clothes and the key part usually i do not like disney films very much if they are not that similar to the original story but with this i am not overly bothered i feel they made necessary changes to make this a good disney film often i do not think disney changed the book in a good way in some of their films br br you know the story already cinderella is a girl working for her horrible stepmother and stepsisters she goes to a ball with the help of her fairy godmother and loses a glass slipper br br this is a film very much to be watched with other people immediate family is not good enough to enjoy this i recommend you watch it with friends and immediate family if you like br br i recommend this to people who like disney at least a little bit people who like fairy tales and for people who like mice enjoy
<START> it's just such a joy to have watched this intriguing project so refreshing and educating not only to a filmmaker who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen time but also as audience who may not be so ready for so much love in such short time br br 20 short films about love in paris are all unique but some of them as expected stand out i thought the tom tykwer natalie portman segment was the best although the mimes made me smile inside just the same br br i clicked on spoilers option for this review bus alas what you read is a spoiler enough just watch it don't read what i write but watch the movie instead br br and smile
