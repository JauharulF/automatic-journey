<START> the blend of biography with poetry and live action with animation makes this a true work of art the narration by sir michael redgrave is moving the length of the work makes it easily accessible for class room exposure or tv video time slots
<START> this is a great canadian comedy series the movie tells of how the stars jean paul tremblay julian and the head writer of the show and his buddies rickie and bubbles play it over the top in what is a true life satirical look at trailer parks and the denizens of said trashy hoods the movie will tell you why rickie and julian begin doing their more advanced forays into the world of crime why and the reasons behind everything would be a spoiler so i shall not give the real reasons behind their more brilliant escapades their friend and oft time partner bubbles is a brilliant character the whole show is brilliant and missing the movie will not affect the way you see the sit com one bit it is a comedy with a capital c and a brilliant satire on trailer park living and small time crooks with small time ideas but big time dreams if you ever have the opportunity to watch buy steal this program grab it you will be glad you did and to my american friends it will break you up also 10 out of 9 brilliant tv how tv should be
<START> had the original casting idea been kept hunting rutger not ice t this movie might have worked sadly racism had to come into the picture literally and mess it up the predominantly black production staff couldn't allow the antagonist be black so they swapped rutger's and ice t's roles this was only the start of the downward spiral of this film ernest dickerson's news room approach to 'directing' only verified that this was another affirmative action job assignment master shot close up close up gads 'who's line is it anyway' even uses more creative camera work eric's rewrite of 'the most dangerous game' is at least an attempt at modernizing the classic tale but fails to give us any motivations for why the characters are doing this we are never given the reasons other than no one will miss these people why the leader re written as rutger does these things aside from a heart felt performance by john mcginley and a fair job by charles dutton do not bother with this one one small bit of trivia there was a real drunk driving accident during filming that injured f murray abraham and resulted in the death of the intoxicated young driver that caused the accident
<START> one of the more 'literate' lone stars with time spent on character development and interaction dialog and acting business the opening scene sets the stage literally for the personalities of the gambler kansas charlie eddy chandler and his buddy john scott john wayne the rodeo say roh day oh star both of whom are slightly randy the film follows their adventures as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the mexican juanita and later in their pursuit of perky mary kornman who has the inevitable evil brother though he'd been led astray by the real villain and wants to repent and oh of course they're being wrongly accused of two crimes and have to serve jail time before escaping and being exonerated at the end br br the high point is scott continually and deliberately ogling mary's butt in her grocery store and knocking away the ladder she's standing on so he can catch her and grab her as she falls it all seems a little contemporary for a 30s western but it sounds better than it actually is br br sadly the exciting action elements we find in many other lone stars are sorely missing here no yakima canutt cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses no george hayes tedious stooge like bi play between scott and charlie with charlie swinging at scott scott stomping on his foot and then punching him repeated two more times the skilled paul fix is underused eddy chandler himself here in his big star turn is not really believable as a randy side kick the villain looks too old and fat so does chandler who spent his later career in 300 more movies as an uncredited meatloaf mary kornman of the twenties our gang see 'mary queen of tots' 1925 is cute in her scenes with john wayne but that's about it for this one seeds of a better western lie buried here br br p s the ultra short colorized version which looks good moves along so fast it's over if you blink more than once thankfully though the embarrassing scenes with eddy chandler have been cut
<START> geez this is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didn't i mean you didn't give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mind br br to be honest and brief this is one of the worst boring and stupid slashers ever made i can't say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell it's made by professional film makers br br the death scenes are horrible bloodless stupid the plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied popcorn from 1991 br br to make things even worse this isn't a movie so bad that it's good it's just plain bad br br molly ringwald tried to do her best but it wasn't enough
<START> there are many police dramas doing the rounds i am not sure why it's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil br br this film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of anne a raw recruit into a police squad stationed in the baltic area no attempt is made to glamorise the police they are truly down to earth harsh at times and unforgiving anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigations br br this is not a pleasant film not one to relax you there is not much feeling of optimism in it the police seem to be involved in a losing battle tomorrow there will be more bashings more murders more family break ups and more distressed children let's face it this is the world we live in br br as days go by anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating the only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character benny a 12 year old from a broken family anne has her own way of patching things up she turns a blind eye to benny's shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can i was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce benny's father it set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs after all the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving children br br well cast but not my idea of an evening's entertainment
<START> a remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the women lawyers association wla of kumba in southwest cameroon in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence in this muslim culture where men have always been sovereign over women according to sharia law one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children after 17 years of failed efforts leaders of the wla began recently to score a few wins and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories br br the leaders of this legal reform movement are vera ngassa a state prosecutor and beatrice ntuba a senior judge court president both play themselves in this film which may contain footage shot spontaneously though i imagine much of it if not all consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera four cases are reviewed and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film br br two cases involve repeated wife beating with forcible sex in one case another involves forced sex upon a 10 year old girl and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child age 8 by an aunt one of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce we follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials the outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children the perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and or fines the divorce is granted br br the aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender neutral when it comes to enforcing the law also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties including those found guilty are treated this is a highly important and well made film of interest is the fact that one of the directors ms longinotto also co directed the 1998 film divorce iranian style which dealt with related themes in tehran in broken english with english subtitles my grade b 8 10
<START> this is the worst thing the tmnt franchise has ever spawned i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was deuce even though i liked the original cartoon br br there's this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are it's atrocious many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didn't bother me so much so that i didn't even remember her until i read about the show recently all in all it's miserably forgettable br br the only okay thing was the theme song guilty pleasure they call it nananana ninja
<START> there's a major difference between releasing an original intense edge of your seat scary gore fest and doing like filmmaker eli roth and his team have done with cabin fever and simply acted like it the film follows five college graduates into a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after the other succumbs to this mysterious fast acting flesh eating disease it's not long before the friends turn on one another and can barely stand the sight of one another much less want to be in the same vicinity as them as gross as it all sounds there's a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked in the hands of a less cocky filmmaker unfortunately what we end up with is poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting a hackneyed script so profanity laden as to leave the viewer tuning out the dialogue and several incomprehensible subplots that motivate little more than in one instance an on screen appearance by director roth this is sloppy film making in several ways avoid this time devourer
<START> feroz abbas khan's gandhi my father a film that sheds light on the fractured relationship between the mahatma and his son harilal gandhi for a story that's as dramatic as the one this film attempts to tell it's a pity the director fails to tell it dramatically gandhi my father is narrated to you like that boring history lesson that put you to sleep at school now the film aims to convey one very interesting point the fact that gandhi in his attempt to be a fair person ended up being an unfair father this point is made in the film many times over and one of the examples given to make this point is that scholarship to england which gandhi twice denies his son instead of showing us how exactly harilal dealt with this betrayal and what went on in his head the director just moves along with the story thus never letting us be witness to the growing resentment harilal feels towards his father which is why when we finally see an outburst from harilal it comes off looking like he's over reacting br br the point i'm trying to make here is that we never really get to understand exactly why harilal became the rebel that he did we never really understand why he turned to islam and then back again to hinduism the thing is we never really understand harilal at all and that's because the director of this film is too busy focusing on mohandas karamchand gandhi and his role in the freedom struggle a story most of us are already familiar with to put it simply gandhi my father promises to examine the strained father son relationship but it doesn't so much as show us where the cracks in this relationship first set in we understand harilal had to live with the burden of being gandhi's son but show us why that was a burden to begin with show us incidents of their early conflict for example it's not enough that gandhi merely says he's opposed to harilal's early marriage tell us why this opposition it's not enough that kasturba blames her husband for the way her son turned out for constantly shuttling him between schools in gujarat and south africa for making him relocate every time gandhi needed to relocate words are not enough show us how these incidents shaped the character of harilal gandhi what's more instead of sticking with the prickly theme of this tenuous gandhi versus gandhi relationship the film goes off on too many tangents thus diluting the impact of the central theme this was never meant to be a film about the struggle for independence and yet on many occasions that's exactly what it seems like because the director feels almost obligated to take us through all the main events leading upto that historic moment even though much of it has no relevance to the film's basic premise the stormy father son relationship so you see the problem with this film is not that it's a bad film but it's certainly a very confused film what happens to harilal's children after his wife's death does he ever have relationship with them where do they suddenly vanish after that one scene in which we see them with the mahatma and kasturba none of these questions are answered in a film that's basically meant to be about relationships in the gandhi family the film version of an immensely popular play directed by feroz abbas khan himself gandhi my father is a disappointment no questions asked cinematically it struggles to translate the filmmaker's ambitious intention to the screen practically every single scene in the film opens and closes with fade ins and fade outs never quite seamlessly leading into each other on the positive side there is inherent nobility in the film which you recognise the filmmaker makes every effort to deliver a balanced narrative trying hard not to take sides never once judging either father or son painting neither as the villain what the film does do however is make clear the fact that gandhi was a difficult patriarch whose ideals may have shaped the nation but evidently alienated his family of all the actors in the film it's only akshaye khanna who really shines in the role of the luck deprived harilal gandhi it's a wonderful performance and it's not easy since the role covers virtually the entire lifespan of the character but akshaye brings a rare concoction of innocence and despondency to that part and succeeds in making harilal a pitiable figure just watch him in that scene in which he discovers his wife's dead and you'll realise how much he conveys through body language alone darshan jariwala meanwhile who plays gandhi senior adopts a caricaturish approach to playing the mahatma in his later years but it's the way he humanises the man in his early years as a barrister in south africa that is the actor's best contribution to that role the abundantly gifted shefali shah plays kasturba the woman who's meant to be torn in this father son conflict but if she's unable to bring across that feeling of helplessness then it's really not so much her fault as it is the fault of a rickety script much effort's gone into the making of this film and that's evident throughout but the film suffers from that inevitable flaw that is eventually what you'll remember about it when you leave the cinema it's just so boring director feroz abbas khan's gandhi my father is a sincere effort yes but also a film that could have done with a much tighter screenplay what we learn from the film is that gandhi and harilal made each other very unhappy and with this film the director makes us too
<START> now don't get me wrong i do enjoy christmas movies i love its a wonderful life and i really enjoy the versions of a christmas carol with george c scott and alistair sim but this particular movie is awful i think the i love life song the ghost of christmas present sings is especially painful albert finney sings fairly well in annie i don't know whats wrong with him in this movie but it sounds as though someone is trying to sing through a mouthful of dead gerbils the only thing that saved this movie for us was shutting the sound off and watching the dance numbers accompanied by the south park christmas cd
<START> every once in a while someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and asks what's with snitch'd i know immediately they have a case of barely hidden amusement horror you see i was the cinematographer on the film br br let me clarify some points regarding this interesting life experience br br originally snitch'd was called one hard hit i met james cahill in july of 1999 a day after i wrapped triangle square a great little 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades it fell eternal victim to the fine print of sag's notorious experimental feature contract but i digress br br i though i was on a roll and when james asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in 16mm with a shooting budget of about 25 000 not wanting to break pace i took it after all clerks el mariachi i too believed the myth back then br br let's just chalk it up as film school for many involved myself included snitch'd was shot over two weeks in august 1999 in aliso viejo and santa ana ca cahill taught drama at a high school in the latter city yes he is a drama and english teacher consider that while watching the film or even observing the use of apostrophe in title hence the locations and cast br br of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of l a 's channel 2 morning news weather girl vera jimenez and of greater impact the debut of eva longoria who had just arrived in hollywood and was as eager as i to get a film under her belt i must say her professional dedication focus and let's do this attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom yet to come br br snitch'd suffered from poor optics few lights or electricity several boom operators du jour and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication none of that overshadows the actual content which speaks for itself br br anyway by 2003 the film was sold to distributors at a net loss i understand who inexplicably had no photos of eva on the box by then she was a rising working name but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic latino gangster to lend credibility to snitch'd since cahill's other passion is antiquarian book dealing it appears to confirm he believes you can in fact judge a book by it's cover as so many have picked up this dvd based on it's sleeve one year later eva now on a soap and i met james for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted split second which i think has never seen any play despite festival intent br br 6 years later i was hired to shoot another cahill film titled juarez mexico i though he had worked out the process my participation was contingent on casting script and crew control and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies for what it was a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in juarez despite claims here and elsewhere the film has never appeared in any festival or venue although cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the dvd release of two studio pictures on the same subject virgin of juarez and border town
<START> contrary to my principles let me first come up with a conclusion because i have just seen this piece of art and still am under strong impressions the reader is asked to excuse my stronger vocabulary br br well this movie is absolutely horrible and i would never bother to write a single word about it if it were not for the fact that 44 minutes made me sick to death which rarely happens to me the fact that i paid for that does not exactly makes me feel better as well as the fact the movie deserved the high user rating here br br so what is wrong with the movie it has a fashionable title 44 minutes one first thinks about 15 minutes which is by the way a much better movie but still bad in my book and indeed the two can be compared to some extent but as luck would have it the things they share are their worst characteristics they both feature mr oleg taktarov who with his strong russian accent obviously meets the popular expectations and prejudices his purpose is to appeal to the cold war mind ah do we miss the good old times now i don't imply that he is a bad actor i am yet to judge his true performance but he is simply not a true individual here he is more like an archetype how anyone can still indulge in such things is completely beyond my comprehension we can recognize modern american xenophobia here the point in the movie when taktarov explains to his companion that romanians are not germans and that they are in america is truly laughable are we to assume that the greatest desire of the wretched duo is to become true americans br br then there is the media issue yes it seems that the most of what we learn comes from cameras interviews and reporters the director should have made us feel the rhythm of the presumed 44 minutes instead he bores us with interviews throughout the movie like in a cheap tv show trying to reinvent the wheel in 15 minutes the issue of media is the central one the point is presented in a way a teacher addresses an obtuse student but that deserves a separate comment we are focusing on 44 minutes now so i have been trying to identify the purpose of this movie what is it to provide good time for the audience to glorify weapons to glorify police portray violence oh yes the officer gives the bible to the underage delinquent so it must promote peace and understanding after all i don't think so but don't ask me i only know i didn't enjoy any of this br br ah michael madsen i admit i am a big fan i hoped he would be a bright point but i was wrong it's not his fault though br br as the final note comparing firepower to willpower at the end of the movie was one of the worst lines i have ever heard br br to summarize on the scale 1 10 i give it a pure unadulterated 1
<START> since their nasty divorce from the disney company with disney keeping the miramax brand the weinstein company seems to specialize in above average movies which are then under promoted and seen by few the flock is a prime example br br a story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping track of registered sex offenders this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than an entire season of law and order svu br br richard gere gives his best ever performance as the soft spoken agent worn out by the task claire danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role instead of the junk she normally gets stuck in and she makes the most of playing the novice the cinematography pacing editing all of it is first rate and i saw no trace of the attention deficit disorder camera jump around or excess camera cuts that others complained about the subject is handled with restraint but it's still a tough subject and might make you sick br br fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes herein shown in abundance which will shock even the jaded then came the supreme court decisions which simultaneously tied police hands as the rights of sex perverts were opened up and america was turned into a shopper's paradise for sexual perversity both willing and unwilling each such step was met with praise by liberals who celebrated the warren court's ill deeds with glossy covers on time and newsweek everyday liberals also praised the court's action and mocked those who disagree in 2007 how many americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women can be subscribed to and delivery of it is subsidized by the discount periodicals rate by the us post office just one part of the problem a problem that can tare anyone's family to shreds br br richard gere is a liberal but he gives his best in his performance here perhaps in his maturing age he's gained a measure of wisdom
<START> i liked the quiet noir of the first part the acting of pacino and cusak especially their scenes together the moodiness of the setting and the juxtaposition of the old pol and the idealistic youth was effecting i wish bridget fonda had more scenes in the movie she was an earnest and appealing character the film went off the rails for me when the assistant mayor starting snooping around the mafioso to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly didn't want him meddling in nobody in their right mind would meet a mafioso on an abandoned dock in a junkyard here the story became implausible something that i don't understand why did the cop and vito have a shootout if the latter was delivering info that could bring down the corrupt judge
<START> another good stooge short christine mcintyre is so lovely and evil and the same time in this one she is such a great actress the stooges are very good and especially shemp and larry this to is a good one to watch around autumn time
<START> the secret of kells is a film i've been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the cartoon saloon in kilkenny i'm here to tell you now it's been worth the wait the cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as i'd feared the whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination i particularly love the animated illuminated book where the little figures come to life on the page the characterisation is superb i love brendan gleeson's voice as the stern abbot and i especially liked the voice of the sprite aisling the forest is a triumph such a beautiful place the story is well realised a mix of fact and fantasy and really draws the viewer in to cheer on brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the book i'm a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway so the subject is close to my heart but all the people i know who've seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that it's a lovely little film i will definitely buy the dvd when it's released and would like to say well done cartoon saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project may there be many more coming back in here to say that i bought several copies of the dvd as soon as i could and gave them out at christmas everyone loves it and i wish them all the luck in the world at the oscars such a joy to see this nominated
<START> this comedy is bound to be good from the get go east meets west and east doesn't want to lose west doesn't know what losing is like it starts a little slow but it grabs you very soon and it doesn't let go this is definitely worth seeing
<START> this adaptation of pearl s buck's film is certainly a classic a true hollywood epic it has all the things a great hollywood film has birth death happiness sadness exhilaration despair and so on there is only one thing that irks me i know it was a sign of the times but neither of the two main characters are played by asian actors paul muni was a great actor and he does an admirable job as wang lung the owner of a farm in china luise rainier plays olan she does not even look chinese i think she tried to get the role but they should have put anna may wong in the role i know why they didn't and ms rainier is very good in the film but they hardly tried to make her look authentic stillm its a great film especially if you read the book i did in high school decades ago its a must see just look beyond the casting i think you can
<START> i don't remember the last time i reacted to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin timberlake's in edison i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish destroy the screen readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism timberlake is horribly miscast in fact casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in patton or nathan lane to play jesus but that is almost beside the point br br timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role i used to have problems with ben affleck's acting talent but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian mckellen or dame judi dench with his metrosexual lisp read lithp his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like the 25 clichÃ© expressions for actors he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly and no matter how you slice it i do not and will not buy his role as an amateur turned crusader for justice journalist it simply will not fly br br however timberlake alone isn't to blame for his failure director david j burke puts him not only in the essentially primary role but also places him aside morgan freeman kevin spacey john heard dylan mcdermott cary elwes and i'm surprised he was as good ll cool j i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlake br br there is an upside to this of course the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief a pleasure if you will freeman and spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so called hero dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh air br br but enough of timberlake bashing words aren't enough in this particular case to do the trick edison is a very very run of the mill corruption story it's plot ranges from clichÃ© to simply preposterous i do however admire the motivation behind making it which i interpret as an homage to films like serpico or donnie brasco or maybe even chinatown don't get me wrong edison is not even in the same ballpark as these films but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence perhaps to justify my sitting through it br br the script in and of itself features some surprisingly bad writing yes it has some decent interchanges but any conversation between piper perabo who is wasted here and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a dawson's creek episode it's your typical far too glib for reality let's impress the audience with how well we articulate and fail dialogue this dialogue mind you is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments sometimes it feels like edison wants to morph into a music video where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds read slow motion br br thinking about it edison is a curiosity it's sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesn't work in film as in most art if one thing is off the whole thing feels off directors must make tough choices david j burke missed the mark here some of the scenes play well in and of themselves but as a whole they don't seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture and it's not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with
