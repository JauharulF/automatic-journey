<START> jack lemmon and walter matthau began and ending their career together remember best as the grumpiest of old men as well as the oddest couple to have ever made us laugh lemmon and matthau were one of hollywood's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years not as raunchy as pryor and wilder instead they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern marx brothers routine such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that marx chaplin and keaton were so famous for in the odd couple lemmon and matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos the physical comedy is as unique as chaplins the joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another not your typical guy film it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime the chemistry between lemmon and matthau is entertainment enough although this movie isn't for everyone this is a great comedy
<START> i have to vote this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance that she happens to see this review takes pity on me whisks me to hollywood and involves me in her freaky funny world but in all seriousness it was good first episode is obviously finding it's feet but it's got that silverman weirdness running all the way through it it's not a laugh out loud sort of comedy but that's good thing too much has a laughter track to it and this wouldn't be right with cues when to laugh it's to the audience to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdness of it all i can easily see this as being the bizarro drew carey show with it's weird characters and incredibly strong central character well worth a watch look forward to the following episodes a very good chance from the usual comedy out there br br ps sarah call me
<START> the idea is a very smart title the film has a serious tongue in cheek feel to it but it is so subtle you don't know how to read it are these guys doing a full blown comedy or is there something else going on the little dialogue the film has isn't very delicate and this adds to the power of the film if all the sound was switched off from the film it actually wouldn't take anything away from the film the physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it on its own carries the entirety of the story br br i is a blessing and with the blessing the emotion is followed by shame i first say this film as part of a black film festival after watching the film i was so impressed by the work but then i asked myself what next where can someone else see this work the common association of art without purpose isn't to be found here you can see the intention in the design from the start to the finish the usage of african music the style the casting everything seems planned and for a reason the character development is amazing the casting i think is the strongest aspect of the film the characters are easily defined within 2 minutes of the 6 minutes of actual film br br we need to see more of these kinds of films there really needs to be greater support for the development of short films across the board
<START> it's funny when you stop and think about it fright film fans tend to a deep and abiding affection toward those who scare the daylights out of them the texas chainsaw massacre may give us nightmares but who among us the faithful didn't feel a very real twinge of love for gunnar hansen in brutal massacre or for ken foree forever and ever the resolute hero of the original dawn of the dead his cameo in the remake made me want to stand up and cheer as did tom savini's cameo i kid you not and brian halloran and well you get my drift if not just stand downwind these are some of the heroes of horror to see this many of them gathered together in a single movie is almost unheard of at least to this degree to my knowledge if only the writer s had been up to such a monumental task maybe someone else somewhere along the line will try again as long as it's not another half hearted effort like brotherhood of blood for instance
<START> when i saw this movie i was amazed that it was only a tv movie i think this movie should have been in theaters i have seen many movies that are about rape but this one stands out this movie has a kind of realism that is very rarely found in movies today let alone tv movies it tells a story that i'm sure is very realistic to many rape victims in small towns today and i found it to be very believable which is something hard to find in other rape centered movies i also thought that tiffani theissen and brian austin green were awesome in the parts that they played i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have a bit of a harsh reality to them i enjoyed it very much
<START> shintarÃ´ katsu best known for the zatÃ´ichi films again stars in this third and final movie in the kenji misumi mostly known for lone wolf and cub directed saga of hanzo 'the razor' itami feature the big dicked one battling ninjas rapeing 'ghosts' and uncovering shady goings on at the shogunate treasury the hanzo 'plot' was kinda getting stale and repetitive what was once novel in the first film was not any longer fortunately this one was better then the second thanks to having more humor i'm just glad that they choose to stop at the one trilogy i'm looking at you lucas br br my grade b br br dvd extras merely trailers for all 3 hanzo the razor films br br eye candy aoi nakajima unleashes both tits mako midori just her left one
<START> so has it really come to this are we as consenting adults to blame for the next generation of cinema goers lack of cinematic understanding and celluloid capability concerning the wayans and co latest addition to the moving pictures scenario little man this united kingdom p g parental guidance anyone under the age of twelve must be accompanied by a responsible adult certificated movie is the epitome of what has now developed into the worse case of dumbing down since cigarettes were wiped out from pictures of movie icons of the 1950's br br the predominantly under twelve's audience here who some without grown up supervision too sat there obediently taking it all in oblivious to their subject and the partly grown up features that little man portrays in part at least too movies in general can do better than this poor attempt while this nonsense is getting them in while they are still young and fresh the biggest fear for the future of cinema is that a child's ignorance just might carry on through to a grown up bliss cinema deserves more than this and so do its ever growing and in the literal sense too audiences this blatant cash cow feeds on the ever impressionable minds of the young br br there is no cinema experience here no open eyed wonder no awe inspiring respect to the magic of movies' there is nothing but bewilderment and contempt for the lack of substance originality and its delivery of mind less tedium and parody of everything that is so now ultimately wrong with the hollywood machine for the sake of a quick buck we must endure our future cinema audiences to the likes of this archetypal disaster movie br br will this have the likes of hitchcock fassbinder leone kubrick and schaffner reeling in their graves money they all liked no doubt but talent and exuberance for perfection and quality and to a vast degree respect for their profession and audience they were never short off we are seeing once again with the works of the wayans clan another clichÃ© of bad taste while the likes of white chicks 2004 were in no doubt a stab at the bourgeoisie of american society the irony here is that the two leading protagonists played yet again by the wayans brothers are so much undercover that all recognition is non existent this makes for a better movie too and it is the actor terry crews that gives white chicks its substance and personality not the wayans br br yet again with their pastiche of 1970's blaxploitation movies as with the 1988 movie i'm gonna git you sucka this to can be seen as a comical and amusing movie with heavy weights as isaac hayes jim brown bernie casey and the gorgeous actress ja'net du bois the point being that little man has absolutely no persona of any kind what so ever he is shallow and narcissistic with no appreciation or value toward his followers he quickly dives in takes your money and before we know it has hidden himself within the cogs of commercialism there is no recognisable effort as to where our money has been spent after scary movie 2000 things could only have gone up but alas they did not no great pondering of artistic value and no doubt that the instalment from these intrepid movie moguls' next movies shall be straight to video one can only hope br br the wayans seem to have created a movie genre all by themselves to a certain extent they have bludgeoned to death the movie parody they have watered down each and every avenue and with their inevitable style they have slowly destroyed the reputation of the last one hundred years that cinema have given us may the ghosts of movies past be ever so humble in their judgement as their growing audiences so far seem to be for when the bubble bursts may they be as understanding too
<START> aside from a few titles and the new sherlock holmes movie i think i've watched every movie guy ritchie has directed twice needless to say i'm a big fan and revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why this movie is a very different approach from ritchie when you look at it comparatively with lock stock and snatch revolver sets us up for a psychological thriller of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the mercy of a set of foes he didn't expect and a guided walk for redemption that he didn't know he needed along with seeing andrÃ© benjamin of outkast fame strut his acting ability other standout acts are ray liotta playing the maniacal mr d macha and mark strong playing sorter the hit man br br after being sent to prison by a tyrannous casino owner macha jake uses his time in solitary to finesse a plot to humiliate macha and force his hand in compensating him for the seven years he spent when he wins a card game and amasses a decent sum from macha jake finds himself on the brink of death as he collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable disease that's left him with three days to live a team of loan sharks however have an answer for him and a ticket to life only if he gives them all the money he has and relents to working for them all in a ploy to both take macha down and show jake how dangerous he has made himself to himself along with having the air of death loom and a pair of loan sharks having a field day with his money jake also has to deal with having a hit put out on him which introduces sorter a hit man under macha's employ the depth with the story comes when jake realizes that some co convicts he spent time with in solitary may very well be the loan shark team out to take him for all he has by crafting all of the unfortunate events that jake seems to find his way into when faced with this reality though zack vincent pastore and avi show jake just how twisted he has become from being in solitary having only the company of his mind and his ego then makes it so that their actual existence is elusive even to jake the movie unravels to a humbling process for both jake and macha as they both come to grips with their inner demons br br the style of the movie is top notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represented and the characters it includes although a lot of nods at ritchie's previous films are here it still has a presence of its own from the dialogue the sets and the experimental take on the gangster genre it's also a great trip on humility and recognizing when you can easily let your ego or a preset notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should the characters are well crafted in this movie with all sides being fleshed out and true to ritchie fashion they're all tied in by some underhandedness that throws a wrench in everyone's affairs i could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuances but i don't want to take too much away from it if you haven't seen it yet br br it may take a few sittings to get through all the intricate layers but it's a great movie and it should be seen if you're lucky and you haven't seen the watered down us release see if you can get the original uk version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take i saw it with my crew around early 2006 and we're still talking about it with little things we've picked up on today it has garnered its cult status and it's well deserved as the film where ritchie stepped out the box and broke his norm a bit br br standout line fear or revere me but please think i'm special we share an addiction we're approval junkies
<START> may seem far fetched but there really was a real life story of a man who had an affair with a woman who found out where he and his new wife were staying and she killed the wife making it look like a murder rape br br in her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him so she quit her job in wisconsin and moved to minnesota br br last i heard she was in a mental institution security prison br br she was still wearing the engagement ring that she has purchased for herself and had told everyone that he had bought it for her br br the events took place in a small town in wisconsin and the murder happened in minnesota br br there even was a feature story in people magazine spring of 1988 i want to say on page 39 i remember this as i was in college at the time and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the security hospital
<START> 18 directors had the same task tell stories of love set in paris naturally some of them turned out better than others but the whole mosaic is pretty charming besides wouldn't it be boring if all of them had the same vision of love here's how i rank the segments that might change on a second viewing br br 1 quartier latin by gÃ©rard depardieu br br one of the greatest french actors ever directed my favourite segment featuring the always stunning gena rowlands and ben gazzara witty and delightful br br 2 tour eiffel by sylvain chomet br br cute visually stunning thanks to the director of the triplets of belleville story of a little boy whose parents are mimes br br 3 tuileries by ethan and joel coen br br the coen brothers steve buscemi hilarious br br 4 parc monceau by alfonso cuarÃ³n y tu mamÃ¡ tambiÃ©n children of men feat nick nolte and ludivine sagnier funny br br 5 place des fÃªtes by oliver schmitz feat seydou boro and aissa maiga touching br br 6 14th arrondissement alexander payne's election about schmidt wonderful look for the pathetic side of life is present here feat the underrated character actress margo martindale hilary swank's mother in million dollar baby as a lonely middle aged american woman on vacation br br 7 faubourg saint denis tom tykwer's run lola run frantic style works in the story of a young actress natalie portman and a blind guy melchior beslon who fall in love br br 8 pÃ¨re lachaise by wes craven feat emily mortimer and rufus sewell plus a curious cameo by alexander payne as oscar wilde br br 9 loin du 16Ã¨me by walter salles and daniela thomas simple but moving story from the talented brazilian directors feat catalina sandino moreno br br 10 quartier des enfants rouges by olivier assayas clean a sad story feat the always fantastic maggie gyllenhaal br br 11 le marais by gus van sant feat gaspard ulliel elias mcconnell and marianne faithful simple but funny br br 12 quartier de la madeleine by vincenzo natali feat elijah wood and olga kurylenko br br 13 quais de seine by gurinder chadha br br 14 place des victoires by nobuhiro suwa feat juliette binoche and willem dafoe br br 15 bastille by isabel coixet fabulous director of the underrated my life without me feat miranda richardson sergio castellitto javier cÃ¡mara and leonor watling br br 16 pigalle by richard lagravenese feat bob hoskins and fanny ardant br br 17 montmartre by and with bruno podalydÃ¨s br br 18 porte de choisy by christopher doyle with barbet schroeder mostly known as the director of barfly reversal of fortune and single white female br br i could classify some segments as brilliant and others as average or even slightly boring but not a single of them is plain bad on the whole i give paris je t'aime an 8 5 10 and recommend it for what it is a lovely mosaic about love and other things in between
<START> while listening to an audio book cambpell scott is the reader i was so excited to hear his voice and that brought back my disappointment that six degrees was canceled they never seem to keep the good shows on air long enough to capture an audience that can connect with the shows story what a shame and shame on th network for not giving this show a full seasons chance this was an excellent show to watch with a great cast the network gave men in trees a second chance witch is also a great show but they took invasion off and that also was something totally different to watch not the same old same old themes why can't the networks get it right
<START> who would've imagined hal hartley creates a filmic corollary to syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style the fusion is highly entertaining br br having not seen a hal hartley film for about a decade i approached this one with some caution his brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog the director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life often in the region of long island new york or in new york city itself that were offbeat and insightful br br my initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a spy thriller to my pleasant surprise hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue it works in more ways than one might imagine hartley's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks along with a singular cinematographic style br br moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides hartley has brought all his skills to something new a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as syriana truly he is coming into his own the cast does a fine job of interpreting hartley's vision and style fans of parker posey will see her in full bloom here still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before
<START> i would not hesitate to put this adaptation of 'death trap in a top 5 list of the best stage to movie adaptations ever caine and reeves an underrated actor who never really got a chance to do more than soggy romances and superman play off each other extremely well here even dyan cannon who i normally don't care for is perfectly cast in a role that exploits her annoyance value as an actress br br i'm not sure that comparisons of deathtrap with sleuth another brilliant stage to screen adaptation featuring michael caine are valid or even fair yes the two stories have a lot in common but sleuth is as much about class warfare as the battle of wits and the house in sleuth is set is at least as much a character in the movie as the two actors the house doesn't really have an equivalent in deathtrap and deathtrap isn't so much a battle of wits as it is a pointed vignette about how people are no damned good and never as smart as they think they are and deserve everything they get i'll just say that both movies are superb examples of the genre and well worth your time and money this is america after all you don't have to choose br br i won't give away the twists and turns of the plot but i don't think it matters anyway i've watched the dvd eight or nine times in a dozen years and still enjoyed the chemistry and the timing and the mean scary moments when things go all pear shaped it's all done so well that the ride becomes more important than the actual destination br br anyone who likes black hearted comedy and suspense in the hitchcock style of film making will probably enjoy deathtrap immensely
<START> ok if you're looking for another bastketball diaries this is completely the wrong film br br i revolves around two brothers max the younger has a major cocaine addiction adam the eldest is a doctor this movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible it however does not it shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present most of the movie focus is on max and his parting ways eventually adam can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well perscription drugs br br this movie has almost no climax doesn't descend into what cocaine really does to you has boring and low budget scenes and the acting of the eldest brother adam is horrific br br i have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards it is not a heart wencher if you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs rent if not buy 'the basketball diaries' and notice the difference br br try to avoid this movie but if you think you will enjoy try and see for yourself
<START> oh if only i could give this rubbish less than one star there were two mildly amusing parts in the whole film and that is it one was where a line or two from the song don't worry be happy was sung by the slugs and the other was where roddy fell of the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs apart so that everything else he landed on on the way down hit him in the groin that is it there was nothing more amusing than that at least not for me anyway doctornappy2 is not right in saying 'fans of the completely terrible shrek might enjoy but wallace gromit fans will probably turn away in disgust ' as i loved shrek 1 2 and 3 and i also love wallace and gromit you see what it boils down to is that if an animation is done extremely well then it is definitely worth watching this however was about as far from done well as you can possibly get the continuity mistakes were too big in number some were pointed out by the makers of this site others were not i won't point out all of the others but here are a few more to see when the young daughter leaves at the start of the film the catch to the cage door comes down and the hook part of it that is on the right clearly goes back around behind the round knob thus effectively making sure roddy would not be able to get out and yet he does just by simply kicking at it at one point the ruby falls down roddy's back and gets pushed straight up into the the air by rita all the while the ship is moving forwards in the next scene roddy has caught it again this is impossible seeing as how the ship is moving forwards the only place when the ruby was ejected out from under the back of roddy's shirt the only place it could have landed was in the water not in roddy's hand there was a third one i wanted to point out but for now i have forgotten it br br too many for want of a better word 'jokes' were repeated in one way or another there was not enough time to establish any sort of connection with any of the characters the characters were hollow shallow and empty and the whole film left you wanting wanting to watch 85 minutes of anything else paint drying or grass growing are two superb options
<START> my siblings and i stumbled upon the champions when our local station aired re runs of it one summer in the 1970's we absolutely adored it there was something so exotic and mysterious about it especially when compared to the usual american re runs petticoat junction green acres you get the idea it had a similar feel to the avengers not too much of a surprise since it was also british and in the spy adventure genre br br i would love to see it again now hopefully it holds up i've mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it so i began to wonder if i'd imagined its whole existence but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it hopefully it will find a new generation of fans
<START> this film is hardly good not great at all a few memorable scenes and the unlucky choice of pairing norma jean with an actual actress jane russell has it all working for her marilyn's lesser woman and or actress one can only wonder why this is considered being one of the highlights of her lame career 3 10
<START> your average garden variety psychotic nutcase deliciously essayed with unhinged glee by stephen sachs knocks off various dim witted young adults to use the term very loosely in dayton hall university which is being closed down for demolition featuring dreadful acting by the entire cast daphne zuniga makes her ignominious and inauspicious film debut here as debbie a bimbo who has her head crushed by a car a hefty corpse tally of 10 okay make up f x by matthew mungle a few bloody murders baseball bat bludgeoning chicken wire strangulation your standard drill through the head bit that sort of gruesome thing a downbeat surprise twist ending which was later copied in intruder a creepy score by christopher hellraiser young a slight smidgen of gratuitous female nudity and endearingly incompetent direction by jeffrey obrow and steve carpenter who also blessed us with the power and the kindred this entertainingly abysmal slice'n'dice atrocity sizes up as a good deal of delectably dopey and drecky low grade fun
<START> i'm an admirer of hal hartley's films especially 1997's henry fool fay grim is a sequel to that film and has a similar style and sense of humor the plot however is completely different fay grim played brilliantly by the iconic parker posey tries to track down her missing husband's notebooks and finds herself amid conspiracies and espionage the supporting cast most of the folks from the first film as well as jeff goldblum saffron burrows and a much welcomed return from 90s indie darling elina lowensohn is excellent and the film has lots of surprises the director claims this is part of a star wars like trilogy serving as the empire strikes back of the series if this is true i can't wait to see the third installment i just hope i don't have to wait 10 more years for it
<START> plants are the most cunning and vicious of all life forms informs one dopey would be victim in the seedpeople a silly flaccid remake of invasion of the bodysnatchers day of the triffids and about a thousand udder moovies and why are seeds moore dangerous than plants one might ask because according to the same dolt seeds can chase us yes i can remember one horrifying incident when the moocow was just a calf being chased all the way home from school by ravenous dandylion seed yeah right unfortunately the monsters in this seedy little turkey kind of look like shaggy little muppets some of which roll around like evil tumbleweeds others which sail about on strings there's not even the tiniest inkling of terror or suspense to be found here for reasons left unexplained the seed monsters are knocked out by 50 volt ultra violet lights even though they can walk about in the daylight which has about 1 000 000 000 000 times more uv energy as you can see not much thought was put into this cow flop the moocow says go weed yer garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here 8p
