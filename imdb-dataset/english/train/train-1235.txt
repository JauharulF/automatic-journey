<START> discovery channel animal planet must be ashamed of themselves this fantasy is modeled after the walking with dinosuars series even though this is 100 fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way even mixing the fantasy dragons with t rexs and the extinction of the dinos added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say sci fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show br br on its own the show is about an 7 5 10 far as entertainment goes but the way in which it is presented i have to give it a 1 10 don't get me wrong i have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong i can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real br br i also think this weakens the great walking with dinosuars series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini series
<START> i just can't agree with the above comment there's lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for it's effective use of silence what's more it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way not pulling any punches in what it shows yet not dwelling and over sensationalising the subject matter it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art house cinema and deserves a place amongst the canon of 'different' horror films like the blair witch project and the original ring both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on it's definitely worth seeing if you're interested in the edges of horror cinema
<START> the tv productions at the 2000's start were between weak and bad before marks like alias lost prison break desperate housewives or monk the tv didn't have the right hit yet which could capture the attention and the interests of the 2000s' viewer titles like relic hunter mutant x the lost world sheena or even baywatch hawaii weren't encouraging for you to watch and follow or at least weren't that captivating and interesting all the time as what preceded them special unit 2 was no exception in fact it's men in black meets the x files' spoof as if these were the special unit 1 but even according to this brilliant formula it didn't work well it was promising at the time there was some saturation out of the supernatural cases after a decade of many x files already so the natural spirit to lampoon it naughtily too imagine mulder as womanizer however special unit 2 wasn't the strongest in this or a strong when it comes to make a comic sci fi show it was highly ridiculous where for instance every sexy situation must turn into ugly disgusting one it enjoyed that bad taste sickeningly michael landes was non charismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian his chemistry with alexondra lee as well as any supposed sexual attention was all languid sure the show got a funny look but overall it was unfunny work it's clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main idea among evan katz 's other works as a co writer and a co producer like seven days before or 24 later this must be a low point despite the distinctive personality it managed to be a silly jest for most of the time therefore if that was there goal so they made one of the silliest indeed and truly it would be one of the rarest times to be thankful for the cancellation of a show after 19 episodes of it only
<START> the early career of abe lincoln is beautifully presented by ford not that anyone alive has seen footage of the real lincoln but fonda wearing a fake nose is uncanny as lincoln with the voice delivery walk and other mannerisms exactly as one would imagine lincoln to have been ford in the first of three consecutive films he made with fonda is at the top of his form perfectly evoking early 19th century america the story focuses on a pair accused of murder that lincoln defends and the courtroom scenes are quite well done the supporting cast includes many of ford's regulars this was alice brady's last film as she died months after its release
<START> in all honesty this series is as much a classic as television goes as the original poem is to the world's literature far from being crassly exploitative it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western culture's defining texts br br i was moved by the plight of odysseus and his followers touched by the drama of the fall of troy which was felt but not seen intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals it should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous cgi creatures flitting around on their ankle wings or poorly cast fashion models in bikinis as in homer's work they act through mortal agents or rarely are represented by classical statuary br br it's a pity it's not available in dvd especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the odyssey that one can find in video stores
<START> this movie is a perfect example of a film that divides people into 2 groups those who get the joke and those who don't people usually attack what they don't understand this film has a comic style and charm that has been unparalleled since it's a great comedy and a great romance it's a perfect date movie a perfect movie for someone who wants a good lighthearted laugh and if your perspective is too tense maybe this movie isn't for you and you may need counseling it is an injustice that paramount has kept this film on the shelf since the early 80's having never seen the light of day on dvd yet they feel an urban version of the honeymooners is a good idea i find it odd that my two alltime favorite romantic comedies have never been released on dvd the other being gene wilder's the world's greatest lover which fox has sat on since the early 80's as well yet from justin to kelly is in nearly every video store in the country there is no justice in the world maybe those who took the time to bash this will enjoy from justin to kelly i'm sure that one is watered enough for them to get sometimes with age people lose their sense of humor or sometimes it just goes stale and they find comic satisfaction in reruns of full house
<START> for starters hobgoblins tries to ape the more successful gremlins that's bad enough but they don't even try to make anything that closely resembles a movie here instead it's more like a bargain basement everything must go clearance of embarrassing scenes inappropriate sound fx acting as bland as unflavored tapioca and a script that takes everything humans hold sacred in their motion pictures and throws 'em down the old tube aroo br br the plot grrrr meddling kids track down gremlin like creatures from movie lot before they kill people by projecting their fantasies sound cool does it well see that wall on the other side of your room run right at it top speed face first see that is cooler than this movie br br you dare to doubt quick name something else one of the leads has been in other than this what other scripts have the writers done since hobgoblins name another rick sloane directoral effort how many hobgoblins action figures do you have see thank you br br i cannot believe i took so long to write about such a horrible film i'd rather write about more important things like the separation of church and state economic restructuring in europe that kind of thing but no hobgoblins it is and it is bad bad like your grandparents' wallpaper bad as pink flamingos on your lawn bad like underwear that says home of the whopper and i think we'll stop there br br well mike and the robots fight valiantly but try as they might they can do only so much with hobgoblins before they realize that yes the director does need kicked in the shin br br real real hard br br one star for hobgoblins seven stars for the mst3k version
<START> one of the finest films ever made why it only got a 7 6 rating is a mystery this film is a window into the world of the black experience in america should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10 i recommend watching it with the long walk home as a companion piece if you think whoopi goldberg's work is about homer and eddie or hollywood squares think again don't miss this movie which should have won the oscar and read the book too
<START> the british 'heritage film' industry is out of control there's nothing wrong with filming classic novels but why must they all be filmed by talentless nobodies this film rips the guts out of orwell's tough novel turning it into a harmless fluffy romantic comedy 'aspidistra' may not be orwell's best work but no one who reads it can forget its superb depiction of poverty orwell emphasises not only the cold and the hunger but the humiliation of being poor in the novel london is a bleak grey cold heartless city and comstock prays for it to be blasted away by a squadron of bombers but this film irons out anything that might be in any way disturbing and creates instead a jolly nostalgic trip to charming 1930s london in which everything is lit with shafts of golden sunlight and even the slums of lambeth are picturesque and filled with freshly scrubbed urchins and happy prostitutes comstock's poems about the sharp wind sweeping across the rubbish strewn streets seem completely out of place in this chocolate box world worst of all is the script's relentless bonhomie ancient jokes and clunking dialogue it's so frustrating because richard e grant is the perfect person to play gordon comstock and the film is packed with great actors but it's all for nothing this film made me so angry britain's literary history is something to be proud of for its richness complexity and power and what do we do with it we employ bland nobodies to turn it into soft centred anodyne pap for people who want to feel that they are 'getting some culture' while they drink their horlicks and quietly doze off
<START> i agree with jerry it's a very underrated space movie of course how many good low budget ones aren't underrated if i remember correctly the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation but not rip off of 2001 because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man who had somehow been turned into a computer and like hal they tried to disconnect his mind but not the mechanical parts of him and as with hal it led to disaster there is at least one funny moment when the christopher cary character who can't find any food finds the abandoned pet bird there's a kind of ominous moment but then the obvious thing doesn't happen after all
<START> every once in a while the conversation will turn to favorite movies i'll mention titanic and at least a couple people will snicker i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by that very movie and they're too embarrassed now to admit it br br i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time expecting to simply enjoy the story again i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years i cried again in all the same places it brought me back to 1997 when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall yes even more than star wars and today many people won't even admit they enjoyed it folks let's get something straight you don't look cool when you badmouth this film you look like an out of touch cynic br br no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults some of the dialogue falls flat and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly however none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film br br leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful leo is one of the fine actors of his generation wait 'til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy kate winslet was so strong in this film the movie really was hers and she held it together beautifully br br james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic the sinking scenes were horrific just as they were that night how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me i was utterly transfixed br br this film is one memorable scene after another titanic leaving port in southampton rose and jack at the bow flying iceberg right ahead the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean the screams of the doomed after she went down and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears br br the music which has also been a victim of the film's success was a key ingredient james horner's score was simply perfect and the love theme was beautiful and tragic too bad celine dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many br br i confess i am a titanic buff as such i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it in all its beauty perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i've had such an interest in the ship all my life however i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy the film was made with such humanity br br another reviewer said it better than i ever could open up your hearts to titanic and you will not be disappointed
<START> revolt of the zombies proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea doesn't necessarily make lightning strike twice br br the halperin brothers responsible for the horror classic white zombie made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled close ups of lugosi's eyes from that previous film there was a court battle with the white zombie film's rights owners who didn't want the halperins to be able to use the word 'zombie' in this title that word was the only thing that could help this film because as everyone knows bad films can make much more money simply by having the word 'zombie' appear in the title knowing what victor halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting it seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle the zombies here seem not to be true walking dead but simply hypnotism victims br br wanna create a mind controlled army of zombies be ready to crack a few eggs including your own br br the lame plot man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend whom she loves jealous this sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mind control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isn't worth spit br br this includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments i've ever seen you'd have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming the acting isn't even good this movie makes the racially insensitive king of the zombies which appeared on the same double bill dvd i bought seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic it makes the atomic age sci fi alien zombie cheese fest invisible invaders seem like a serious drama this is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a korean film fan twitch south korean films are often known for their use of melodrama the credits list the ironically named company favorite films i'm not sure whose favorite film this would be but they're obviously an idiot br br not recommended for fans of zombies romance or classic films
<START> it's a colorful slasher movie that's about it br br it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies but i never care for such things figuring out who's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway br br the death scenes were inventive and gorey bringing back memories of 80's horror movies like friday the 13th br br another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious br br people who don't like slasher movies won't like this movie as simple as that i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same br br mb
<START> i don't know where to begin this movie feels a lot like one of those cheap saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties sort of like captain power or the power rangers it's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding secret agencies and villains br br the acting is so bad that it's not even funny the direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity it seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot br br perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents car for some reason even though the device is clearly stated as being remote detonated the bad guys decide to chase her down on their motorcycles as she drives away this chase carries on all the while with the bad guys doing ludicrous and completely pointless bike stunts standing up on the bikes doing wheelies and so on at one point a crash happens and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike we see the bike clearly cgi thrown over the agents car but the rider has vanished then a few seconds later the rider and bike return apparently unscathed by the crash at this point even though the car has an explosive device planted in it the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving past then blow up her car which was also clearly done with cgi sound confusing it is and so is the rest of the movie br br i might point out that when i say cgi we aren't talking about lord of the rings type cgi here we're talking the cheap cheesy power rangers type cgi actually i think it would have been done better on power rangers br br why savini and todd did this movie i will never know i can only assume they did for money as a favor to someone or because they were blackmailed into it probably the last one
<START> i think that people are under estimating this incredible film people are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 1 10 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have stephanie beaton this is the reason why i think that it deserves the 10 10 for the pure entertainment of the film br br the general view on this movie is that it has bad acting a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cant be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this but i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece that has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining
<START> i sat through this turkey because i hadn't seen it before and because the premise sounded like it had potential it was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence at the height of the storm the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving in fact when the characters move outside the house bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops at that point whatever credence the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film too bad all hurricanes aren't like this one it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the sunshine state
<START> this is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie the acting is excellent considering the script the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding the gore is well done and used sparingly look out for the excellent barbed wire death the action is punchy when used it's true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times but compared to other movies on the same or bigger budget it's hardly noticeable at all overall this is recommended trust me it's better than it appears 8 10
<START> although well past the target audience i've always had a soft spot for ya fiction so i was naturally intrigued by the return of nancy drew to the screen br br this is not a bad film the central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously so young audience members will not be upset br br what i really appreciated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience br br emma roberts is great as nancy drew and hopefully we'll see her again in another mystery
<START> i watched this on an 8 hour flight and presumably because of the pressure and the altitude i actually found it mildly entertaining emphasis on the mild br br the actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies her fiancÃ© falls in love with someone else she decided to make sure they don't get together but eventually she lets them do it sadly the actual film wasn't as good ok there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on i think the whole gay but not gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it wasn't really very funny br br in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me but it was a close call
<START> this is very much a television version of the tale the film starts out like an episode of 'xena ' with little meaningful dialog or character description it does get a bit more substantive after a while but all characters are still cartoonish br br salma is the exotic beauty richard harris is an evil and sexually repressed frollo fiending to bust a nut up in salma the other characters including quasimodo are quite forgettable br br its also a sorta liberal version of the story frollo is a suppressor of enlightenment ideals like the abbot in 'name of the rose' and quasimodo is a champion of liberty the shadowy side of the quas character is ignored though he does pour liquid led on people he is really only an outsider in that he looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than the average person br br perhaps the film is intended for children but i doubt it considering frollo flogs himself bloody to amend wanting to spank his monkey a mostly uninteresting and forgettable but not awful and sometimes entertaining rendition of the tale
