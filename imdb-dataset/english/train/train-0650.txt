<START> this is one of the few movies released about a what if type of situation that made me think it was amazing to hear them speak to each other and reminisce about all the wonderful and not so wonderful things that happened between them i actually think that there is a very good possibility this occurred like the movie implies and they actually made peace with each other those are good memories for every fan to hang onto and to ask what actually happened between them would be selfish what an amazing movie this was the comedic aspects of the movie were wonderful to think that they were together to patch things up between them in such a way is a comforting thought to people who wish they had a chance to clear the air with someone they didn't get to to see john as such a caring laid back character was refreshing from hearing all of the trash that was spoken about him
<START> this is one of my all time favorite movies and i would recommend it to anyone on my list of favorite movies mental list mind the only ones on par with it are movies such as the lord of the rings series spirited away and fly away home br br i can really relate to the main character jess at the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls she really sucks you into her life i also certainly can't fault any of the protagonist's acting or anyone else's in the film br br the soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules the movie is never boring the romance is really cute and didn't make me blush tooooo hard one thing that really made it though was the indian factor jess' parents are indian and there are many colourful indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else the indian people are also hilarious essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it br br feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film they're funny they're refreshing and they make you feel good
<START> the drug years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini series or other kinds of tv documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on tv it's actually not long enough in a way all of the major bases in the decades are covered and they're all interesting to note as views into post modern history and from different sides but it almost doesn't cover enough or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time for example the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business unto itself of shipping mass amounts of drugs partly the marijuana later cocaine is really well presented but there are more details that are kept at behest of how much time there is to cover br br overall though the documentary does shed enough light on how drugs pop culture government intervention the upper classes and lower classes and into suburbia all felt the wave of various drugs over the years and the interplay between all was very evident nobody in the film except for the possibility of small hints with the pot goes to endorse drugs outright but what is shown are those in archival clips about the honesty of what is at times fun and then tragic about taking certain drugs the appearances of various staunch ridiculously anti drug officials does hammer some points down hard with even in such an overview of the drug cultures and america's connection as a whole as there is really only one major point that is made a couple of times by one of the interviewees the only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not 'just say no' because as the war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought it is really just to come clean on all sides about all the drugs and the people who may be hypocritical about them as for example oxycontin continues on in the marketplace br br is it with the great interest and depth of a ken burns documentary no but for some summertime tv viewing for the young i e my age who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago as well as for the 'old' who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks careless times and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years earlier propagated and advertised it there are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased which is not totally untrue but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social political and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving for better or obvious worse for enough of a fascinating view
<START> if you're researching ufo facts then this video is very important the 'meat' of the video is the comments made by buzz aldrin he is without a doubt from the best of america trained to be objective honest and factual in his reports many astronauts from america of all eras have reported some kind of contact or ufo observance and there are videos from some of those missions at the very least something has happened that requires further objective ongoing investigating i think this testimony from buzz aldrin shows that it is possible that other worlds may be interested in our progress like all supposed documentary video this one may be slanted but it does contain further information and opinions from an accomplished american hero those don't come along every day so the fact that some people aren't interested in details should not detour your from viewing this video if nothing else it is interesting and i recommend you watch with an open mind
<START> pushing daisies was a wonderful show much like dead like me and wonderfalls you can tell was created by bryan fuller i can understand how people who don't have much of a love for theater cinema musicals and the like would be annoyed this is not a typical television program and the fantastic is too much for some these people seem to need some a little more linear and muted tone to keep them happy this program explodes with color winks at old movie scenes hums with incredible music and talented performances there is nothing random about the choices that are made from costume to leitmotif the story takes many twists and turns but all very accessible because the conversations are about love honesty courage loss and so many other things we face every day the only unfortunate aspect was the ending of the show and that was rushed because pushing daisies was canceled don't approach this as a typical tv show think of it as an evening at the theater then sit back and enjoy
<START> wow so much fun probably a bit much for normal american kids and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits very terry gilliam all the way through while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel esquire moments the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid hero with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike's work the layers of meaning and metaphor particularly the anti war anti revenge message of human folly is pretty damn poignant as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films only instead of over the top torture and gore he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi faceted adventure f'n rad and one of miike's best
<START> alien hunter 5 out of 10 is it me or does every movie that starts in roswell new mexico suck take alien mixed with the thing mixed with contact mixed with of all things on the beach the andromeda strain the classroom scene from raiders of the lost ark and a throw in a little stargate to boot br br derivative doesn't even begin to describe this movie of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease james spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable leslie stefanson asks to join himÂ he turns her down aggh br br in fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it i mean if your going to have impossibly good looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an antarctica research base why not go for broke br br with about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie alien hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci fi adventure needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the alien itself is a horribly clichÃ©d artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title br br i also inquired during viewing what is with the children of the corn in space motif note that since jason of friday the 13th fame pinhead from hellraiser and that leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield the characters in the cornfield dress like logan's run extras and i was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them br br that however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant the acting is mostly fine as spader reprises his stargate role while stefanson and janine eser model the latest in antarctic beachwear john lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it br br alien hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper children of the corn in space movie
<START> the john van druten broadway hit is brought to the screen with a maximum of star power in this romantic fantasy about a modern day witch who beguiles a successful manhattan publisher james stewart may get top billing but it is kim novak who steals the show as one of the most alluring witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen the lead pairing is in fact one of the movie's few weaknesses the gray haired stewart seems a bit old for the role and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for novak it's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him as they seem mismatched in temperment and outlook it is one of the story's amusing conceits that witches and warlocks are portrayed as greenwich village beatniks and bohemians curiously the stewart novak pairing would generate a lot more heat in vertigo released the same year as this film but then vertigo had a compelling suspense story and the benefit of alfred hitchcock's direction br br the film's comic moments are mostly provided by the stellar supporting cast including a young jack lemmon as kim's warlock brother elsa lanchester their ditzy aunt and ernie kovacs as a befuddled writer hermione gingold even shows up in a hilarious cameo as a sort of grand witch there's lots to like in this movie wit romance and a great cast that is if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting miss novak i have seen the movie a half a dozen times and i never can
<START> its spelled s l a s h e r s i was happy when the main character flashed her boobs that was pretty tight before and after that the movie pretty much blows the acting is like e list and it's shown well in the movie not to mention it is so low budget that preacherman and chainsaw charlie are played by the same person the whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film the only other reason i liked the movie was because chainsaw charlie and doctor ripper were funny they said many stupid things that made me laugh other than that if you see this movie at blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind lawnmowerman 2 anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated
<START> how the grinch stole christmas was a wonderful little christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy i never did see the reason for a remake not to mention a remake that was made with humans the cartoon was just perfect enough what's the purpose of this film but it also seemed a little odd for jim carrey to be the grinch i mean he's a great comedic actor but him as the grinch it just didn't make any sense to me his performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable the whole story of the grinch and cindy lou who was over done and wasn't needed they actually just destroyed the story period br br all the who's in whoville are getting ready for their best christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly but cindy lou who is curious and worried about the grinch that lives above them and that he's not going to get as good of a christmas as the other who's he kicks her out and decides that he doesn't want christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal christmas all together to show the who's what his version of christmas is all about but soon he realizes that the who's may know that it's a little bit more than what is the materialized version of christmas br br how the grinch stole christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top i really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version at least in my opinion the make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done not to mention that how the grinch stole christmas was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring jim carry but at least this version makes you grateful for the boris karloff version that is played every christmas br br 1 10
<START> actually it was pretty funny in a god how the hell did this movie get made kind of way if you life making fun of movies which i kinda do go ahead and watch it but if you're actually thinking is this a good movie eff off br br this movie sucked from the very beginning scene with the worst acting i've ever seen in any movie usually they get five minutes into it before you realize this movie might suck but no you know right off the bat this movie talks about edgar allen poe never tried to explain it though to people who haven't memorized poe's life story so i don't know if any of what was said is fact br br this movie is about a writer ethan poe hookin up with his cousin ann they're both descendants of edgar allan poe or are they apparently people give a what their ancestors did this guy ethan poe is actually ethan usher who is supposed to be descendants from the story the house of usher that was written by edgar allen poe ann's brother shows up sometimes to try to rape her ann's also being stalked at one point in the movie by three different people on the same street seriously three they're like right behind her glaring at her and she doesn't even realize the characters that are being murdered throughout show up at the end to try to save the day but they can't at the end ann shoots ethan while he's trying to kill her best friend of course before she shoots him she has to scream out nevermore this movie should be seen nevermore
<START> previous commentator steve richmond stated that a walk on the moon is in his words not worth your 7 i ended up paying a bit more than that to import what is one of the worst quality dvds i have yet seen of this film or any film in existence even when you ignore the fact that the dvd is clearly sourced from an interlaced master and just plain nasty to watch in motion the film has no redeeming qualities save anna's presence to make watching a top quality blu ray transfer worthwhile not that this is any fault of the other actors liev schreiber diane lane tovah feldshuh and viggo mortensen all score high on the relative to anna paquin acting ability chart far more so than holly hunter or sam neill did in spite of an equally lousy script anyway director tony goldwyn's resume is nothing to crow about but pamela gray's resume includes wes craven's most dramatic excursions outside of the horror or slasher genre so one could be forgiven for thinking this is a case of bad direction br br as i have indicated already the sole reason i watched this film is anna paquin in her acting debut she literally acted veterans of the industry with a minimum of twelve years' experience above hers under the table while she is not as far ahead of her castmates here her performance as a girl that starts the piece as a brat and grows into a woman whose world is crashing down around her proves her oscar was no fluke for some time i have been stating to friends that she would be the best choice to portray the heroine of my second complete novel and a dialogue seventy three minutes into this film is yet another demonstration of why this woman could literally act the paint off walls anna aside only liev schreiber comes close to eliciting any sympathy from an audience sure his character spends the vast majority of the film neglecting a wife with an existential crisis but he plays the angered reaction of a man who feels cheated brilliantly i should know even if it is not from the same circumstances here br br viggo mortensen also deserves credit for his portrayal of a travelling salesman although perhaps not to the same extent in a manner of speaking he is the villain of the piece but he successfully gives the character a third dimension yes his actions even after the whole thing explodes are underhanded but not many men would act any differently in his situation nobody wants to be the other man in this kind of messed up situation so viggo deserves a lot of credit for giving it a try here unfortunately these are all participants in a story about a woman who feels trapped in a stagnant marriage where tovah feldshuh tells us that the mills and boon archetype of women being the only ones who feel life is passing by simply does not exist either writer pamela gray or director tony goldwyn thought they could just put this line into the film without thinking of how the audience might receive it anna even gets to speak the mind of the audience when she asks diane who she is to be lecturing anyone about responsibility br br that said the film does have a couple of things besides anna going for it mason daring's original music while not standing out in any way gives the film a certain feeling of being keyed into the time depicted that helps where the other elements do not roger ebert is right when he points out that while liev is a great actor putting him alongside viggo in the story of a woman forced to choose between her marriage and her fantasy is a big mistake he is also very correct in that when the film lingers over scenes of lane and mortensen skinny dipping or mounting one another under a waterfall it loses focus from being a story of a transgression and becomes soft porn the film seems terminally confused about the position of its story no matter how many times i rewatch liev's scenes i cannot help but feel he has been shortchanged in the direction or editing one does not have to make their leads particularly handsome or beautiful but taking steps to make them the most interesting or developed characters in the piece would have gone a long way br br ebert also hits the nail right on the head when he says that every time he saw anna on the screen he thought her character was where the real story lay stories about the wife feeling neglected and running into the arms of a man who seems interesting or even dangerous are a dime a dozen to such an extent now that even setting the story in parallel with an event as earth shattering as the moon landing will not help in spite of feeling revulsion at the manner in which her character's story is presented anna might as well be walking around with a neon sign above her head asking the audience if they would not prefer to see the whole thing through her eyes while i am all too aware that it is difficult to control exactly which character your audience will find the most interesting from your cast it is very much as if they did not bother to try with lane and schreiber fans of these two would be well advised to look elsewhere hopefully by now my ramblings about the respective performances will give some idea of where the whole thing went wrong br br i gave a walk on the moon a three out of ten anna paquin earns it a bonus point with one of her best performances and that is saying something
<START> while the original 1932 version with preston foster was good there's no remake more worthy than this 1959 one or more impossible to find anywhere just as i strongly suspect mickey rooney to have had something to do with that never could a mere performance have ever been so masterfully brilliant or a script more thought provoking as well as an improvement upon the original many years after the last of my several viewings of this film in 1970 i read an article in which mickey rooney was recounting a visit he'd made to death row and which had apparently very drastically eliminated whatever sense of personal identification he'd felt with people in similar circumstances the article was about as short as the main character here and didn't cover much other than the extent to which his extreme disillusionment with the quality of the inmates themselves had been emphasized even in language i would not care to explicitly quote here one of my main problems with capital punishment is that of course it is not evenly impartially applied just as many innocent people are far too carelessly thus unnecessarily sent to meet this particular fate another problem i have with it is that it is not applied swiftly enough or for that matter even publicly enough the bible makes a special point in such cases about one of the more important purposes of such as a deterrent being ineffectually obscured minus not only a public viewing but also the direct participation of all as for those who claim to prove statistically that such is not an effective deterrent in addition to having a problem about the reliability of their data i have little if any objectively disprovable doubt many are behind bars now due to the extent that such a deterrent is lacking however i do have a problem about the fact that robert duvall in the apostle had been punished at all for his particular crime or that the only hope of leniency for one such as he would have to be based on a temporary insanity defense as though that would serve as the only acceptable excuse in his kind of case in addition to various other questions concerning the motives of mickey rooney for that particular visit he'd recounted and about the answers to which i can only try to speculate i suspect the main one had been of a decidedly religious nature i don't know exactly when he'd become the professing christian he now makes it a special point whenever possible to emphasize that he is but as anybody should be well aware this particular category of people tends to be the most vehemently out for blood when it comes to extracting an eye for an eye however i have no particular bone of contention concerning that per se just as there's no doubt scripturally speaking that not all and perhaps not even most shall be spared the same ultimate fate at the hands of the lord himself as a result of his sacrifice on the cross however there is a problem for me about the spirit or attitude with which most professing christians emphasize their enthusiasm for capital punishment for contrary to the lord himself who would love to see everybody saved ezekiel 18 32 ii peter 3 9 they seem to go vindictively out of their way to find reasons to condemn what most people on either side of this superlatively ever burning issue cannot appear to sufficiently appreciate is that the lord is as dynamically and elusively soft in nature as he is hard the two sides of his nature appear to be so inherently incompatible as to render him mentally deranged at least by any strictly human reckoning yet regardless of how harrowingly ungraspable this miraculously dynamic blending of the water and oil in his nature surely is there can be no doubt that anything short of it or anything fanatically and characteristically on either one side or the other of this equation falls inadequately and unacceptably short of the entire judicial truth indeed i've seen the most blood curdling thirst for the same come out self contradictorily enough on far too many occasions whenever the categorically anti death penalty advocates are confronted even in the most rationally well balanced ways with the fact that although the lord died for everybody not all are thereby going to be saved after all in order to receive absolution one must to repeat the same term reach out and receive it that is repent luke 13 3 5 could anything make more sense but then what about the lord's command to forgive even in the case of one's enemies of those who despise and persecute you without a just cause or provocation one of the far too prevailing difficulties with this kind of sentimentality as popularly misinterpreted is the way it obscuringly over simplifies the real meaning of forgiveness the act of forgiveness does not in itself mean the same thing as unconditionally excusing the one being forgiven when one takes a clearly sober rationally well balanced view here from the perspective of god's own attitude all it actually amounts to is a fervent wish that the one forgiven will ultimately succeed at finding his way seeing the light and being granted mercy this attitude is of course the very opposite of say that of jonah who actually resented it when god told him that his preaching to the people of nineveh would result in their repentance jonah didn't want them to repent but vindictively desired that they be destroyed how self righteously cold bloodedly like unto most professing christians he was save that even his reasons were undoubtedly better than most i envy jonah almost as much as he would me however minus the repentance of the one being forgiven any forgiveness he may receive from a genuine christian is not going to do him any good in such a case the only one to benefit is the real christian himself
<START> recipe for one of the worst movies of all time a she male villain who looks like it escaped from the wwf has terrible aim with a gun that has inconsistent effects the first guy she shoots catches on fire but when she shoots anyone else they just disappear and takes time out to pet a deer then you got the unlikable characters 30 year old college students a lame attempt at a surprise ending and lots lots more avoid at all costs
<START> very outdated film with awful clichÃ© ridden and mawkish dialog and a very poor construction in addition cassavetes and falk overact constantly a pseudo good movie it takes no time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is the first scene is a total bore filled with histrionics and hysteric exchanges the sound is horrible camera movements are without imagination as is the building of characters no poetry no subtle psychology no interesting shots the actors smoke constantly and we see ads for beer beverages very cheap indeed one exception ned beattie s nice and simple way of playing the hit man
<START> rajinikanth becomes born again after getting a magical power which he can use seven times br br there are several problems with this movie that are obvious to the casual audience the 50ish rajinikanth is still at home with his parents the father of the girl next door thinks that he is a compelling boy 'vaseekaramaana paiyan' rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the movie with his sermons the worst being how women of yesteryears got their exercise through household work yet we are to believe that he is not a theist even though he was well read he wastes six of his seven powers on a stupid kite i can go on but you get the picture br br there are god men there are gods and there is rajinikanth the directory has difficulty fitting rajinikanth into one of these categories initially rajinikanth is just rajinikanth doing what tamil heroes do stand up to villains and in spite of being the oldest getting courted by the prettiest girl in the movie rajinikanth does this well and some of rajinikanth's trademark styles are actually enjoyable baba count is a novelty what makes this movie unbearable is that those few initial minutes are just a preface to an worst book to be ever written even that preface is punctuated with some comedy which are forced and obvious br br the director doesn't explain the purpose of the hero we see that the hero is facing several hurdles from politicians as usual but we can't really root for the hero because we don't know what the hero's ultimate goal is at the end when everyone wants him to be the leader the hero gives another one of his sermons and walks away to become a hermit the director offers no solution to the problem in the climax scene br br a r rehman's score is really interesting either he shows patches of brilliance or he didn't bother to invest himself fully into this movie who can blame him there is one scene where rajinikanth steps into the van of one of the crooks and then throws the knife and starts his baba count the music is very apt for the moment and acts as a catalyst adding further tension the songs are all mediocre no one would bother with the songs from this movie after a few years br br unfortunately 1 is the lowest rank you can assign in imdb this movie has all the elements that justify its rightful place at the nether of imdb's ranking
<START> bottom line best romantic comedy ever this movie accomplishes what all great movies strive for the creation of a world and time that we want to re visit and makes us glad to be part of the human race when i am blue this movie lifts my spirit and makes me laugh and that is still true after many viewings always fresh br br all of the actors are in top form the characterizations are so dead on and the characters mesh so well together that you forget the actor usually difficult to do with matthau robbins and ryan the supporting cast is consistently brilliant fry agae a total pygmy package jacoby saks maher the three theoretical physicists as greek chorus but time doesn't exist durning something we can launch from nj shalhoub whaley robbins' boss and co worker at the service station and curits eisenhower how many comedies have eisenhower br br don't miss this overlooked treasure
<START> i'm going to go on the record as the second person who has after years of using the imdb to look up movies been motivated by nacho's film the abandoned to create an account and post a comment this was hands down the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life the plot was on the verge of non existence and none of the puzzle pieces added up in any way whatsoever the acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing how this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me the only saving grace i could find was anastasia hille's cunning and repetitive use of the f word and brilliant sound design if i were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores i would be up against a difficult decision i'm disappointed that i am unable to give it 0 stars
<START> this movie starts out with a certain amount of promise but in my view begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down that this well meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family's life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories br br i found this movie average at best art direction could have been much better as could have been cinematography the acting was good and so was eva van der gucht's singing
<START> sure we all like bad movies at one time or another and we in fact enjoy them this however wasn't even a guilty pleasure it was just crap some guy vince offer who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk high probably both and thought it was a great idea to make a movie he then proceeded to show his script to equally high drunk individuals overall this movie was so bad predictable and unoriginal i couldn't get through 20 minutes of it before i turned it off it makes you got served look like citizen kane bat man wtf some guy that walks around with a bat real original almost as good as calling him fat man and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit
