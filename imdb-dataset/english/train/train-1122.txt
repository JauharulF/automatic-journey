<START> come on let's get real the knights of christ ordo templi or the knights templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early 12th century the story is so laughable that it's pathetic dolph lundgren just looked positively bored and besides if you wanted to have a real life templar why not just use the knights of christ who are still in existence in portugal at least they should have taken history into account the only redeeming quality i could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or gothic period pieces the acting was bad the storyline appalling the action horrible and the props were okay
<START> br br according to reviewers the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year old college kids about to enter grad school jolly joke br br 1955 the synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet but there it is on the bandstand the ford pony car was not invented yet but there it is playing oldies music the synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970's the pony car at best is from the mid 1960's br br 20 year old college kids josh brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made for tv movie was produced br br the plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their tv's
<START> the movie frailty is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film it has all the trappings of a horror film but this it is not frailty is a film about perceptions of religion and realizing the differences between right and wrong br br in frailty a middle aged father bill paxton and his two sons claim to be doing the work of god it turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called god's hands we watch the father kill the demons in some rather brutal ways while convincing his sons and himself that they are doing the work god and that what they are doing is right he claims that he received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons living here on earth god has given him a list of names and in return for his services he and his sons will be given protection which basically means the police will never be able to capture them we see all of this unfold in front of us in a very disturbing manner but what is really disturbing about it all is the effect that it has on the two sons particularly the oldest son adam adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being that is until his father and a week in the cellar changes all of that he knows that his father has obviously lost his mind and is pretty sure the same is happening to his younger brother fenton fenton the other half of this puzzle takes everything in as if it were his own religion he seems trapped in his father's world of god and demons i suppose this is because he's so young and easily impressionable but everything that happens to these three is rather convincing in fact too convincing br br the events that occur in the film can be looked upon as a vivid hallucination that is being experienced by the three main characters i say this because they each react to the situation in different ways and at one point in the film they each claim to see god dad first sees the murders as his mission his mission eventually consumes him and quickly turns into an obsession with eradicating demons in fact his hallucination is the primary one his orders and the list of names he receives are all a part of this hallucination watch the scene where dad finds the ax in a barn to figure out where i am coming from fenton the younger son is easily impressed by all of this talk of demons and destruction since he is so young it's easy for him to fall into his father's trap adam on the other is very skeptical towards his father's actions br br spoilers br br in a way the hallucination ends when dad is killed towards the end of the movie i will not say how or under what circumstances but i will say that it is not pleasant after his death it fast forwards to the present day the story is being told through flashbacks as seen through the eyes of the oldest son adam in actuality it is fenton that is telling the story not adam as originally believed the story is being told the way he perceived it through his actions and his brother's actions fenton has gone insane and is continuing what his father started by luring the fbi agent into his trap br br since religion is a major theme in this movie the film also plays on how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those that do not have a full understanding of it before dad discovered his newfound mission he himself did not have a clear understanding of religion nor did he fully believe in a supreme being his sons fenton and adam often sang innocent little children's church hymns but yet probably did not have a clear understanding of what the lyrics meant after the revelation of dad's newfound mission they both took off in separate directions adam remained in doubt of there being a supreme being while fenton was gradually sucked into his father's madness br br a very good thriller that will creep the heck out of you do not watch it alone
<START> yeah sure it's cheesy it's not zombie but it's not that bad either it has beatrice ring which is a huge bonus and it's entertaining i had the good fortune to meet fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience as he was never completely satisfied with it it is well worth a search out especially for genre and fulci fans it is a film that is far too often dismissed out of hand
<START> the traditional western is synonymous with wide open spaces clearcut morality inevitable storylines the optimistic faith in a hero's ability to shape his own destiny to escape his past these qualities reflect directly the american sense of self the self shaping dream the pushing of boundaries and frontiers which is why the genre is still alluded to by opportunistic politicians with some noble exceptions eg wellman hawks the western was healthily free of neuroses or real anxiety anthony mann changed all that forever and this first foray into the genre is one of the most violent vivid complex not to say exciting westerns ever made br br the traditional western depends on a hero who exemplifies rugged wholesomeness whatever misfortunes he may have had in the past a supporter of order and right who dominates the film removes its obstacles restores harmony in effect and an obvious villain who often ironically drives the plot forces the hero into certain actions the difference between the two is often delineated as mythically simple as the wearing of white or black hats br br mann's background was in film noir a genre antithetical to wide open spaces and optimism noir was neurotically charged focusing on the dissolution of an unstable protagonist where morality is blurred the hero is as often the villain trapped in an interior labyrinth of his own making a passive victim to destiny noir is about regress not progress the interrogating and denying of modes and signs of representation not the creation and confirmation of them br br winchester 73 is fraught with noir anxiety noir is often considered a psychological genre visualising the traumas of its protagonist's head 73 does this too and is all the more disturbing in that that protagonist is lovely homespun jimmy stewart initiating here his great run of difficult films with mann and hitchcock in many ways good natured and sweet representing right and trying to restore disruptions to the natural order he is also a near lunatic who will stop at nothing to achieve murderous revenge whose relentless quest mirrors ethan edwards in the searchers in its inhuman persistance whose human instincts are frayed by this quest and whose bursts of violence are genuinely terrifying to witness br br as in noir his anxiety has a psychological base unlike most 'healthy' heroes who have outgrown symbolically killed their fathers mcadam's father was killed before he could complete the process his chasing his brother is less moral revenge than an anguished protest against stunted growth the climactic shoot out is not cathartic mcadam staggers back into 'normal' society like he's just witnessed some of the world's most ghastly horrors br br what is most unsettling about the film is that it's not really about a hero or a villain at all but an inanimate piece of weoponry that drives the action 73 opens with the gun of the title privileged on display behind a glass window while its admirers are trapped squashed undifferentiated framed admiring it outside throughout the film human power is reduced to the most arbitrary of signifiers names change lin and dutch mime shooting each other because they've no guns quests lose their moral vitality and their practitioners veer close to madness armies have to ask for help from confederate strangers to fight battles a man becomes worthy of respect only when he mentions his name another man is revealed as a coward when he abandons his fiancee to the indians the gun retains its prestige power wholeness br br it's not the revenge plot which drives the film but the story of the gun this wrenches the film out of conventional expectations and creates an eerie alienating modern feel we become so caught up in the revenge plot that when we follow with the gun another plot entirely we feel slightly bewildered br br this emphasis on the gun symbol of potent masculinity actually allows for a critique of that masculinity revealing pointless elaborate rituals at the expense of society and order brute capitalist greed murderous indian traders who defraud both seller and enemy cowards psychotic killers before returning to its 'true' owner a broken hero thoroughly compromised who has become as murderous as the murderer he seeks the gun is never imprinted with the name of its owner not only because there is no fixed owner but because there is no fixed masculinity an insight anathema to the traditional western br br 73 brilliantly invokes western myths wyatt earp dodge city the cavalry the civil war the wide open west only to undermine them earp has an inflated reputation that is all name but never proven dodge city is no safer against outlaws than anywhere else the cavalry is inept custer has just lost little big horn and the bitter feud of the war is shown to be irrelevant the myth of the open west is a site for a very closed inescapable circular plot which traps its characters refuses to allow them shape their destiny but allowing it to shape them br br the old john ford silhouette of riders on a vast mountain is reprised but signals here not progress but repetition and circularity but for all its deconstruction the film is also tangibly vivid in a way few westerns ever achieve mann's incisive technique intrudes his camera in crucial positions alternating revealing distance with intense examination making the saloon doors and stagecoaches seem thrillingly alive and lived in
<START> this movie is bad i don't just mean 'bad' as in oh the script was bad or the acting in that scene was bad i mean bad as in someone should be held criminally accountable for foisting this unmitigated pile of steaming crud onto an unsuspecting public i won't even dignify it with an explanation of the plot if i can refer to it as that i can think of only one other occasion in some 40 odd years of movie watching that i have found need to vent my spleen on a movie i mean after all no one goes out to intentionally make a bad movie do they well yes apparently they do and the guilty man is writer director ulli lommel but the worst of it is that blockbusters is actually renting this to their customers be advised leave this crap where it belongs stuck on the shelf gathering dust
<START> i had some time to kill before watching football so i saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it i thought i had encountered my version of mentally walking the bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the mummy series and jurassic park it was so bad that i thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup the acting was so bad that i was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end the lead by casper van dien made me long for the high caliber acting of steven seagal in on deadly ground as his line reading was so wooden that woody woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder i also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that i was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat the direction was so abysmal i looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage the fx of the movie was so bad that i thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade z horror flicks from yesteryear what robert wagner tom bosley and geoffrey lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie my warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your iq to diminish with prolonged viewing on a side note i noticed at imdb that sometimes salaries for movies are published i was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies beware and be safe avoid at all costs
<START> that's incredible fidani who he was also a spiritist was one of the cheapest director of all the world this movie stole the original title of leone's duck you sucker but tell the boring story of a pinkerton agent against the killer testa di ferro the improbable gordon mitchell a stuntman all is poor and crazy in this pelicula filmed into the dear landscapes of lazio the story is bad and crazy at the same time fidani was not able and ingenuos at the same time into the story happened some kind of crazy illogical things like the discussion into the sheriff's house and the demential appearance of butch cassidy yes really butch cassidy who is portrayed like an idiot terribles nuit americaine absurd comportaments illogic plot bad acting and a fugace appearance by one of the most rewarded anchorman in the story of italian television renzo arbore ah of course klaus kinski yes is great and terrible but i'm sure he was in it only for money an for playing with iron horses 2 of 10 but don't miss it
<START> q e d was a brilliant tv series and it truly was one of the very few worth scheduling for i suspect that in this era of tivo and recording devices that it would fare much better than it did in 1982 i am eagerly awaiting its availability on dvd br br while it is true that it has some in common with other television shows like the wild wild west the bearcats and the adventures of brisco county jr all of which i am a huge fan of q e d had a much more intellectual quality to it it did not suffer for that however the dialog was witty and the action was high the show ran in the uk as mastermind and it did have something of the bbc feel to it but with better production values than bbc typically had in that era br br i was a nineteen year old lad when this series ran initially and had much too much to do in my life to make time for television i remember my dear mother however calling me to remind me that q e d was on and we would sit on the phone and watch it together wonderful memories br br truly q e d is a sad loss and if it could be done with the same quality and values today i would love to see it make a return
<START> looking for quo vadis at my local video store i found this 1985 version that looked interesting wow it was amazing very much a ken russell kind of film quirky stylized very artistic and of course different nero was presented not so much as evil incarnate but as a wacky unfulfilled emperor who would rather have had a circus career he probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of leading an empire it wasn't much fun and fun is what he longed for klause maria bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth yes nero persecuted the christians with a vengeance one of many who did so at one point one of his henchmen murmurs no one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves he got that right
<START> in carmen saura once again seeks to establish a dynamic rapport between reality and fiction between the actual passions of the personalities in a dance company preparing the choreography for the dance portions of the opera carmen and the scripted passions from the story of the fictional carmen the famous fatal mix of a free spirit read disregard for fidelity and her ability to drive men mad with desire saura used this same vehicle fiction reality in an earlier black and white film bodes de sangre blood wedding but whereas the tensions between the dancers rehearsing blood wedding showed to advantage how they evolved into the fictional characters of the story to be performed through directing their emotions into their roles in carmen the parallel between the petty libidinal urges of the dancers of the troop during rehearsals and the spirit forging to do with the mythic carmen never comes even close to being believable it remains a gadget and for that reason a bothersome distraction one really needs to see blood wedding next to carmen to appreciate the comparison however it hardly matters the melodrama saura tries to impose upon his carmen because the flamenco dancing and guitar music of the rehearsals which are 95 of the film by some of the best known flamenco dancers and musicians more than repays the price of entry a flawed film and a wonder perfect for doing a drill in keats's 'negative capacity' perhaps
<START> this movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites the voices for the animals are wonderful sally field and michael j fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch but the real standout is don ameche as the old faithful golden retriever this movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults humorous and suspenseful and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry happy tears
<START> i have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel jane eyre both dalton and clarke are very believable as rochester and jane i've seen other versions but none compare to this one the best one for me i could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again the last time i saw this one was in 1984 when i was only 13 at that time i was a bookworm and i had just read charlotte bronte's novel i was completely enchanted by this miniseries and i remember not missing any of the episodes i'd like to see it again because it's so good
<START> after just finishing the book the same day i watched the movie i knew what was supposed to happen i had high expectations of the movie because of the rating the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie i have a couple main points for not liking this movie br br spoilers br br 1 the casting jack nicholson barely fits into jack torrence's character also i would have never picked shelly duvall for wendy i pictured wendy much differently i can see why they picked jack nicholson though the grin the pointy eyebrows but he's not supposed to really look 'evil' he's supposed to look normal and he turns evil also they make one of the worst movie couples danny was alright he needed more life though he acted way to droney br br 2 the screenplay they cut out so many things that were in the book and added things some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted changed or handled wrongly some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to seeing the hedge animals the roque mallet the elevator were not in the movie and it was 2 and half hours i was extremely irritated br br 3 the ending the ending was changed completly halorann died jack froze to death wendy never got hurt the overlook didn't blow up the ending was so cool in the book and the movie messed it up so horribly i was apalled hallorann was never supposed to die but jack killed him with an ax if they wanted to kill him at least have jack use a roque mallet you never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie br br there are other things that i didn't like about the movie but there are things that were all right the camera angels were cool the blood coming out of the elevator didn't happen in the book was cool but maybe i was too irritated that the movie didn't go with the book to try to be scared at all i reccomend reading the book before you see this movie i applaud stephen king for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis stanley kubrik any more i would never have done that i would have taken all the rights i could get to yell at him all day i can't wait to see the 6 hour version at least it has the hedge animals br br rating 2 10
<START> remember these two stories fondly and in the first set in the not too distant future we see a young boy preparing for examination day the state i q test the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why the examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth the boy then asks puzzled again why wouldn't he it is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry but their son's i q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial a corker of a concluding scene a message from charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present a nice story with a heartwarming conclusion
<START> guns blasting buildings exploding cars crashing and that's just the first ten minutes br br this action packed film involving a rogue ex cia mercenary who can't seem to die no matter how many times he's shot hence the title is pretty decent br br tough and toothy gary busey usually cast as a villain in these kinda flicks has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued after all he's carrying the entire show which doesn't mean there isn't a lot of terrific supporting roles including william smith luke askew mills watson r g armstrong henry silva lincoln kirkpatrick thalmus rasulala and several other forgotten character actors br br there's enough smaller action sequences to hold up the entire story busey has to free a group of kidnapped american military elites and return a high tech supertank a normal tank with a cheesy add on pasted to the top back to the states br br but does america deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys this question is asked of course like in any film centering on the cia but without getting preachy
<START> '1408' is the latest hodge podge of cheap scare tactics the kind that might make date movie styled horror fans occasionally jump in their seat and scream in your ear but disappoint audiences searching for a little depth and direction br br john cusak plays a writer who's made a career of writing books describing his experiences of staying in rumored haunted hotels despite assurances by patrons and owners that ghosts roam the halls there is little to make him a real believer in the paranormal when he learns of the history of room 1408 at the overlook hotel no wait i mean dolphin hotel in new york city he decides it would make the perfect closing chapter to his latest book but samuel l jackson playing the hotel owner strongly attempts to dissuade his guest with narration of the atrocities that have occurred in theat room since the hotel's opening many years ago the story is simple and we as possible skeptics must sit through jackson's lengthy foreshadowing ramble br br in other words be afraid be very afraid br br of course it would be easy to convince audiences that they've just paid to see an edge of the seat thriller if it didn't take so long to build up to this point and also if what followed was a lot more than cheap boos that become so frequent and arbitrary that eventually you might soon expect them the temperature in the room changes automatically the walls drip with blood the fearless writer can't open the door etc and after nearly an hour and a half of delivering these to audiences promised big thrills you might sit and hope that at least you can be wowed by the ending with suspicions of dream sequences and other derivative time wasters even that fails to quell our doubts that before the movie is over we might finally have something to make the movie a little less than completely forgettable br br despite grand performances as always by cusak who essentially is the entire film most everyone else of note is wasted i e samuel l jackson in insignificant minor roles the true mystery here is how this movie received such a high viewer rating ballot stuffing ghosts
<START> it had to be you is another sign that hollywood is running out of ideas this picture is about charlie hudson a former police officer turned author when charlie's fiancÃ© goes out of town he's stuck with all of the wedding planning he spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets anna penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married the two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate weddings together this is when the plot gets boring charlie falls in love with anna and she has to choose between a safe life or charlie this movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else micahel vartan and natasha henstridge give really mediocre performances which just makes this movie all the more gut wrenching to watch
<START> if you like a syfi soap opera this show is for you as fare as i am concerned it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes i just can't watch it anymore it is boring and slow and for a show that the timeline is based around 100 000 years ago if you base it on battlestar galactica's timeline for arriving on earth they sure seem to have all the same stuff around like the 100 000 year old chevy vans driving down the streets and people watching the 100 000 year old popular name brand lcd t v sets it also goes the same with the rest of the sets as well on the show there is just to much of today's stuff involved in it to not overlook i think they could have done a lot better of a job to get around these issues and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same issues but not nearly as bad as fare as the rest of the show it is not nearly as good as bsg was and it is a poor pre sequel to itÂ
<START> ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other paper back released come from according to 'jake speed' they are based on real people living out the adventures they write about and publish this movie is quality family entertainment moderate amounts of violence and skimpy clothes at the worst the language is is also not a problem and the jokes are funny at all levels this is a 'austin powers' look at 'indian jones' without the over the top antics of michael myers i highly recommend this film for kids in the 10 to 15 range
