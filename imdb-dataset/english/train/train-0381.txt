<START> corny i love it corny just as the tv show was about 40 years ago adam and burt rekindle the same on screen chemistry that never seems to have left they re live old memories plus the actors that play them from the 1960s show some behind the scenes things which are quite interesting to know 1960s tv was corny escapism for so many of us back then and this dvd is no exception if you are familiar with the original tv show the fight scene with the written boofs and bams or whatever is fantastic the movie theater scene shows clips of the villains who passed away at the end frank gorshin makes an appearance he passed away not too long after this dvd was made i believe so it is to his great credit that he came back to again play a villain to adam and burt just as he did to batman robin so many years ago he didn't lose his touch thanks to julie newmar to re living a villain role also in conclusion i think that this dvd is for great memories and i wish to thank both adam and burt for coming back and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original thanks guys
<START> i liked it but then i think i might have been ironing at the same time this reworking of cyrano de bergerac roxanne is an utterly undemanding formulaic romcom rescued from straight to video ignominy on its release by the sharp turn of janeane garofalo playing the frasier of pets she finds herself caught in a love trap when insecurity leads her to pass her best friend uma thurman off as herself when a caller comes a courtin' br br this is an interesting film in the fascinating career of ben chaplin an average british actor he gave the hollywood treadmill a shot with this film he is unremarkable and his anonymity in studio productions is unsurprising on the basis of it although he has appeared in substantial cameos in both the later terence malick films uma thurman does a ditzy turn on autopilot and michael lehmann packages it all together competently icky phone sex though 4 10
<START> it is no surprise that writer director michael powell considered a matter of life and death his and emeric pressburger's spellbinding fantasy from 1946 to be his favourite of their films together released during the aftermath of world war 2 this colourful romantic adventure would have provided just the tonic for a traumatised recovering nation in need of a good uplift br br following a string of other patriotic war films 'the archers' made this one their quirkiest skittish and most patriotic of the lot quintessentially british for upholding british heritage shakespeare beer fair play good manners it is also visibly americanised in its baroque compositions technical inventiveness and a fine multi ethnic cast br br oddly echoing another 1946 classic it's a wonderful life amolad opens on a grand firmament with one of those jolly voice overs preaching about the earth and the heavens and what a big wonderful world we live in br br it then cuts to the inside of a british cockpit badly hit up in flames and with the co pilot already dead it sounds misconceived but the connection is soon made lucid with the events that follow br br clocking in at nearly 5 minutes the rapid fire exchange between british pilot peter david niven and american radio contact june kim hunter is breathtaking in its intimacy resigned to dying peter nevertheless exhausts plenty of vigour charm and outpouring confessions and his warm affiliation with june closes with a mutual exchange of 'i love you ' br br keeping with the magic of the moment peter by oversight of his conductor 71 whose job it was to transport him to the 'other world ' escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach he later encounters june riding a bicycle and instantly matches the body with the voice br br but realising their error the high court want peter sent back and order the french conductor maurice goring down to earth to retrieve him but peter is adamant to live because of june and the conductor's mistake and wilfully guards his corner br br peter's fate ultimately lies with the heavenly court and american prosecutor raymond massey whose jury consists of several deceased war heroes and posh british delegates the surreal trial which dissolves from b w back into rich technicolor once the verdict is announced may well be a dream but the final shot in the hospital validates the predictable outcome br br the abstract frame filling stairway to heaven the american title of the film is used twice the first time in b w when it elevates peter and his enigmatic french guardian upwards crossing giant statues of peter's potential attorneys for the trial including abraham lincoln and plato the second time the softly lit colour stairway provides the setting for what is an iconic image in cinema peter and june frozen side by side their marvelled eyes fixed forward in the frame their fate sealed br br the unlikely affection shared between peter and june never turns mushy or verbose it's treated with nobility and the perception that the couple are already suitable enough to be married and simply need to convince people of their love so it can keep them together br br the french conductor who can freeze time and people's bodies obtrudes many of their key moments together lecturing peter about history and among his mischievous tricks pinching peter's 'top 100 game tricks' book and his coffee cup br br as visually inspired as other powell pressburger collaborations this was the first time they combined colour with b w Â the latter having a cheerful quality when used for the heaven scenes and both are equally captivating br br the outstanding script more than matches the imaginative set design with dialogue that sounds so immediate that is doesn't feel like it was written or performed for the screen amusing and witty powell pressburger's writing deserves equal acclamation with their forte for colour and composition br br made in 1946 a matter of life and death is one of those films that defies it age looking fresh and inventive even in this age where cgi would vamp up its artificial effects probably stripping them of their emotional wonder br br other jarring changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for cutting and the inevitable plea to shorten dialogue so it can preserve the low attention spans of most audiences powell weaves a spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame giving him freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of peter's predicament
<START> this movie is actually worse than most movies i've ever suffered through and i've suffered through a lot absolute nonsense it's got terrible forced dialogue pointless plot developments really drawn out 'spooky imagery' scenes which look more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie 5 10 at best attractive women long boring sex scenes involving said women forget what you know about virgins especially ones with lop sided fake breasts muttered difficult to understand speech from some of the characters and they actually used the masks from killer klowns from outer space during a masturbation scene which should be a saving grace because that movie was pretty funny but it isn't veden fell is the lamest bad guy in the history of film br br absolutely give this one a miss
<START> what an utter disappointment the score of 6 1 here on imdb built up some mild expectations but oh my was i disappointed the first thing that bugs me are those braindead stereotyped university kids yes i know teens can be childish and so on but why are they in movies always portrayed as complete braindead morons there was one character that i thought was alright but he she not revealing it here was killed off way before the end the other characters was poorly executed and even the supposed hero heroine just didn't do it for me on the plus side the plot is pretty good and the productions values a cut above for these kind of flicks the acting was generally not very good rutger hauer stands out in a small role but it all fails with bland and braindead characters you just stop caring about them after 10 minutes 4 10 and thats being generous
<START> this movie was amazingly bad i don't think i've ever seen a movie where every attempt at humor failed as miserably let's see the acting was pathetic the special effects where horrible the plot non existant that pretty much sums up this movie br br
<START> i tried to like this program i really did i even bought the pilot film first on vhs and later on dvd however i couldn't get into this story because its two main characters david bruce willis and maddie cybill shepherd just seemed to in love with themselves for one thing i admit was some clever dialog in the shows which was a key part of the success of the tv program and i did appreciate of lot of that dialog br br basically this was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the '30s and '40s with male versus female you get lots of arguing accusations yelling and screaming a lot of people apparently love that sort of bickering but i hate it so i never got on the moonlighting bandwagon br br only allyce beasley as the hapless aide agnes was entertaining it's too bad she had such little air time shepherd was nice on the eyes and i suppose women would say the same for willis but too much arguing between the two finally turned me off
<START> i wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine it wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic the storyline is different and i am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands directing and acting were awful i had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs although the movie started promisingly it got worse and worse i think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters i still think that it is worth watching as i haven't seen films subjecting gay porn don't keep your expectations high though then you will be very disappointed out of
<START> first off i knew nothing about 'mazes and monster' before i watched it i had no knowledge of the role playing controversy behind it or the fact that it was a made for tv movie when i looked at the cover the updated dvd one i seriously thought it would be another fantasy adventure like 'legend' with tom hank as the nerdy hero from 1980s earth entering a mythical world to save a princess from an evil maze filled with monsters sounds exciting right that is what the cover suggests to you at first glance i was given this movie as a gift obviously under the same premise because my aunt knows i'm into action movies with a medieval myth theme and it has tom hanks one of my favorite actors so i popped this movie in expecting a feel good movie with tom hanks in a 80s special effects world that would be good for a laugh br br no none of this happens now before i continue i will confess i am a nerd but i have no interest in role playing games that is all this movie is about so my interest in the content is lukewarm at best and m m copyright infringement is not even a feel good role playing based movie with lovable geeks that uses their imagination to enter a world of awesomeness no this is an anti role playing movie that must have been made by some religious folk the same people who also think barney is the work of satan i understand satan is a crafty fellow but i don't think he is desperate enough for soul to lull rpg lovers into worship him this movie is thee anti gamer movie this is what i get from this movie it hates rpgs and not only does it make fun of the people engaging in role playing but it makes poor tom hanks a mental patient br br tom had an excuse to talk to a volleyball in 'castaway' poor guy was alone but tom somehow made his insanity fun and you literally saw the volleyball as a lovable character through tom's good acting i wish i watched that movie instead of this in this movie tom is attacked by a make believe dragon creature it looks like a poorly made mascot for a rpg team and has a split personality that is creepy at best tom's acting only exceeds to make you feel bad for his character and nothing else i get that the poor guy lost his brother and is not right in the head because of it so the movie does win points for being intentionally tragic i am not one for films that exploit mental illness and the ending to 'm m' made me feel like cr p luckily i watched 'hudson hawk' afterwards and got a good laugh before my soul was crushed any further yah 'hh' surpasses 'm m' by a lot this is not one of tom's better films in fact it is thee most depressing movie i've ever seen him in even 'saving private ryan' is not this depressing i walked in hoping to watch a feel good movie and i ended up feeling the exact opposite if you want to watch a sad both emotionally and visually movie then by all means watch this if this movie is to convey a message it is this don't play rpgs if you are cuckoo for coco puffs
<START> if the redundancy of getting off the boat on the boat off the bus on the bus is a way to waste time then you should go back to the hollywood films that wrap this part up in one montage in order to get to the money shots and in doing so leave you unconnected and in the cinematic limbo that results from not really showing the realities of life the long drawn out travel sequences actually allow the viewer the same frustration and 'wait in line' feeling the characters must endure frustrating yes vital indeed the limbo of that travel is the key to the 'rootlessness' of this turkish family beautiful film with great acting sad but worth it
<START> up until this new season i have been a big 'little mosque' fan however the new season had absolutely ruined it br br the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad light br br i am neither christian or muslim but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend not any more br br just cancel it and be done with it it's not worth watching any more br br it might still be saved but a lot of change would need to be made br br bring back the old format
<START> ironically although he can do the splits thomas is a complete stiff as an actor br br this film is seared into my memory as one of the most side splittingly cheesy and incompetent movies i have ever seen as such i'm actually rather fond of it br br still the only reason this gets more than one star is that thomas is great shape and it's fun to see his tiny muscular body performing various feats of gymnastic skill on the oddly shaped rocks and poles scattered about the east european country side including the infamous pommel horse shaped well cap in the middle of a village square that thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various insane villagers but let the poor guy open his mouth and try to emote and any illusion that he might have a film career is immediately dashed to bits br br thomas at least had the excuse that he wasn't really an actor everyone else in the film actors director editor camera guys etc is at least as bad or even worse and most of them are professionals so kurt doesn't come off quite as badly as you might think br br i hope poor kurt took the money and ran if anyone ever asks him to perform in a martial arts film again i'll bet that thomas kicks the guy in the face
<START> oh dear we don't like it when our super hero love interest develops a brain do we br br something has happened to people they have lost the ability to enjoy a simple feel good love story comedy kirsten dunst is a revelation funny sexy and real i laughed out loud ooh at least five times and i'm not ashamed to say had a tear in my eye a couple of times too the cast acting and script is great i watch a lot of films right across the board and i haven't seen one in this genre that has been as successful those who disagree please tell me where i can find some i'm sure the book is good too but i think you have to judge it on its own merits
<START> schlocky '70s horror films ya gotta love 'em in contrast to today's boring slasher flicks these k tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula br br this is a b movie about the making of a b movie that went horribly wrong faith domergue this island earth stars as an over the hill b movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home her boyfriend director who looks and acts like gordon jump with an attitude is filming on location and on a tight schedule the ken doll co star discovers a book of tibetian chants that they work into the script to add realism unfortunately realism is something they could have done without br br john carradine having long since given up looking for the 17th gland the unearthly now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate he goes about his daily work but always seems to run afoul of the director br br the horror builds slowly a dead cat here john carradine entering a grave there finally culminating in seven yes seven murders at least there's truth in advertising it's just sad that the ghoul didn't understand that there was a movie being made above him how was poor faith to know that those darn tibetian chants would actually work face it you just can't go around tugging on satan's coat and expect him to take it lying down br br sterno says perform an autopsy on the house of seven corpses
<START> undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups it tells the story of patrick galloway an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in ireland to investigate some weird phainomena the game is set in ireland after world war one so don't expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers all the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate on our hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the left so you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game the graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power p c level design is also cool and atmospheric mostly the game revolves around the covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress thanks to the talent of clyve barker the game has an excelent storyline and plot something very rare for a first person shooter and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent but the game has two main flaws first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of exploration secondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry as far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not frustratingly difficult overall undying is a great game definitely one of the best fps out there
<START> ok admittedly as an orthodox woman who lives in boro park i'm going to be a little biased against this film however it seemed that boaz yakin's sole purpose in making this film was orthodox bashing with our wigs modest attire and separate seating we're a pretty easy target already yakin never made it past the surface the result is a film with more holes than swiss cheese 1 yosi tells sonia off for loving him more than g d or their parents then he deliberately defies his father's order that he not go swimming because of his poor health 2 sonia flips out at her son's bris why would a hasidic woman from monsey have such a strong reaction it's hard to believe that she never attended one before let's face it even reform jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays 3 was mendel sleeping during his chosson classes he's supposed to satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street especially in the middle of the busiest street in boro park 4 sonia and mendel had to have been married for over a year and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other a little clue arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with nor will she be shunned by the community if the marriage doesn't work out 5 if sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly she did not have to go through her lecherous brother in law there are orthodox female doctors lawyers teachers etc sonia came off as more whiny than sympathetic instead of taking control of her life she sat back and waited for things to happen and then complained that she didn't like the outcome that's not standing up to one's environment that's pandering to stereotype frankly i think she got what she deserved
<START> 9 11 hosted by robert deniro presents footage from outside and inside the twin towers in new york on september 11 2001 br br never too grisly and gory yet powerful and moving 9 11 is a real treat anyone not moved by this television show is immune to anything br br 5 5 stars br br
<START> extremely thin 'plot' of satanic rituals or some such mumbo jumbo provides the hokey excuse to thread copious amounts of sex scenes together straight vanilla sex masturbation lesbianism s m bestiality incest and a few other sexual proliferation's all get their time in the spotlight here the problem is the storyline is so dull that the rampant sexuality gets pretty tedious after awhile who knew that a film with an intimate goat girl encounter could be so damn boring well now i do br br eye candy venessa hidalgo shows all helga line provides t a both on display quite frequently women viewers get the occasional penis br br my grade d br br region 1 dvd extras trailers for pick up legend of eight samurai don't answer the phone prime evil sister street fighter also the same dvd holds a second feature movie evil eye
<START> i was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in england i've seen hundreds of films since but i've never forgotten this one although sinatra was playing a not very endearing character he was excellent in the role a lot of people seem to think that he did'nt really come into his own until his role in from here to eternity but in my opinion he was magnificent in concho the other role that sticks in my mind is that of william conrad i'd never see or heard of him before this film conrad plays a terrific part in this film i remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his character also i remember the music that both introduces conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears an excellent film and my only disappointment was that i never ever got the chance to see it again it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth i see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when i saw it was indeed in full color i remember sinatra's blue shirt
<START> an unfunny unworthy picture which is an undeserving end to peter sellers' career it is a pity this movie was ever made
