<START> this is a bit long 2 hours 20 minutes but it had a a lot of the famous pearl buck novel in it in other words a lot of ground to cover br br it was soap operish at times but had some visually dramatic moments too capped off by a locust attack at the end of the film that was astounding to view considering this film is about 70 years old the special effects crew on this film did a spectacular job br br paul muni and luise rainer were award winning actors in their day and they don't disappoint here both giving powerful performances the only problem is credibility as all the asians are played by caucasions and some of them like walter connolly just don't look real i'd like to see a re make of this movie with all asian actors not for pc reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible
<START> even if it were remotely funny this mouldy waxwork of a film would still be soberingly disrespectful stopping just short of digging up the boys' corpses and re enacting 'weekend at bernie's' Â but only just Â producer larry harmon and the director of the frickin' 'ernest' films use holding the copyright as an excuse to crap all over stan and ollie's legacy gailard sartain does a fair ollie impersonation but bronson pinchot wouldn't reach tenth place in a stan lookalike contest even if they were both spot on the film would be no less detestable the less said about the surrounding catastrophe the better makes 'utopia' look like a dignified swan song
<START> that shall be a documentary i saw it which is forbidden in germany and i have to say that it was the worst documentary i've ever seen it is nothing but one big lie from the beginning to the end who can doubt after this trash that all jews were supposed to be killed in the concentration camps
<START> here's a rare gem for those of you that haven't seen or most likely not even heard of this during the 80s dennis quaid was a hot commodity but in the early 90s dennis quaid disappeared from the scene in 1993 he burst back onto the big screen with three movies all of which unfortunately bombed two of those films i liked very much and let me elaborate on one of them br br wilder napalm is a crazy flick about two brothers wallace quaid and wilder arliss howard whom are fire starters yes they have the power of pyrokinetics br br wilder has decided not to use his power anymore for anything not useful anyway after a fatal incident during his youth where he and his brother blew up an abandoned house which killed a man who was inside unbeknownest to them nowadays wilder is a firefighter and is married to the wacky vida debra winger who is under house arrest for guess what arson see the movie to understand this better wilder also hasn't spoken to wallace in 5 years because wallace set his hair on fire during his bachelor party br br wallace loves his pyro power and uses it for amusement he also runs a carnival and is the head clown when the carnival comes to wilder's town wallace decides to reunite with his brother and also to see vida whom which wallace has been in love with vida's house arrest sees its end but wilder is preoccupied so wallace steps in and the fun begins brother vs brother fighting fire with fire br br some great fireball throwing in this flick eat your heart out drew barrymore br br the film also has some really weird yet funny elements like wilder's fire unit sings songs acapella during firefights and after wards jim varney globally known as 'ernest' pops in as wallace's redneck carnival buddy wilder napalm is brilliantly shot and cleverly put together very off the wall and avant guard br br give this one a look
<START> honestly the concept behind masters of horror had something going for it big time horror directors that are now left aside by the industry being given a chance to direct horror again i was all for it from the start that is until i watched some episodes oh boy it's really bad tv not only does it seem like the directors are being given very little budgets to direct their skits but there seems to be guidelines as well like shooting in hd for example to make a long story short it's bad both for artistic and reasons financial reasons i cannot help but compare to the tales from the crypt and the m o h episodes really don't stand the comparison tftc was good moh is bad according to me here are a few keys to explain it tftc was shorter around 25 minutes for each episode than moh 50 minutes per episode i believe it allowed denser screenplays with good ideas reoccurring more often better overview of an episode less chances to let the plot be confusing or boring duration might have been also the reason why the budget was better spent on tftc directors got to have real film music composers composers on moh are if inexistent very bad real actors whereas on moh it's nothing but unknown actor after unknown actor real directors of photography and it can help sometimes real film cameras while moh is shot on hd cameras with very wrongly chosen lens pieces the result of which being that the episodes of tftc looked and felt cinematographic in the sense that there was real actors being casted ranging from michael j fox to tim roth to kyle mclachlan to kirk douglas but there were also film composers behind it of the range of alan silvestri great directors of photography like dean cundey high end screenplay writers and in that sense each tale was a little movie of its own true kind compared to tftc the masters of horrors is quite a lame approach to tv horror it's very hard to stand looking at it if your standards regarding cinematography are just a little above average because it looks the same as any ugly tv serial if not worse it gets boring and even annoying incredibly fast within the first 10 minutes usually the actors are never heard before wannabes except for fairuza balk robert englund angela bettis and a few but even there they are the only famous actors of their episodes the director base for moh was good in the beginning but it's getting worst and worst with every episode now if even the directors are unknown to the world what remains nothing and it's funny how they are starting to have complete unknown directors while they haven't even had say stan winston dick maas william lustig sam raimi eric red robert harmon william friedkin jim muro stuart gordon russell mulcahy if even masters of horror cannot bring dead directors back to life who will maybe a rerun of tales from the crypt will
<START> the title should have been the walker that was only he did walk br br there was nothing on the movie that was good the description of the movie doesn't really comply with the plot br br the only thing that i can get from the movie is that he was a good son but a low life terrible person br br i'm sorry that i expend my money and time on this movie i saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie i stayed hoping that it will better what a mistake i got worse br br if there is a suggestion that i can make to he producer is to re direct his life to another field because making movies is definitely no his cup of tea
<START> this show is awful no comedy no plot no good characters america are you blind give the award to real shows i hate this show along with 30 rock honestly i'm so glad they canceled this show thank you cbs keep two and a half men keep christine keep rules of engagement keep how i meet your mother which really isn't funny but a lot funnier than this this show is a rip off of friends with the same director so thats okay but keep this show gone and never bring it back never ever ever ever the only reason i didn't give it a 1 rating is because it keep my awake instead of asleep those are the types of movies or tv shows that i give a one the only reason i was still awake was because of the audiences laughter and i was looking forward to the next show i really wish this show was funny sorry but my opinion stupid very stupid i don't see why everyone loves it my opinion again but i also find big bang theory kinda stupid my bad smart the class bye bye now i have a smile and it is not from watching your show
<START> every movie critic and metal head hated this movie but i enjoyed it i saw this as a child on tv somewhere and was amazed by the scene where sammi comes on stage and plays trick or treat by fastway br br the movie itself was typical 80's guy gets pushed around by bullies and enlists supernatural help to beat up the bullies but goes to far and has to be destroyed br br matt from melrose place picks on skippy from family ties so skippy gets a record of tony fields from gene simmons to comfort him and all hell breaks lose the highlight being where tony sings lip synchs and dances to a metal song before the shyt hits the fan br br there were a lot of errors and stuff but the music and the overall imagery was enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10
<START> i love westerns i could watch them all day the good the bad and the ugly is my all time favorite i watched silverado for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was being featured on cmt however this movie shiloh falls is without a doubt the worst western i have ever watched the acting was terrible all around they explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing the only good part i can think of is the good looking cantina girl the very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length this movie wasn't even worth the new rental fee i paid at our local movie rental store i felt like i was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing only reason i finished it was because i hate to not see a movie through to the end i turned it off half way through because it was so bad to the director please do a better job if you decide to make another this is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to westerns
<START> like most people i was drawn to buy this film because of the pictures of the mighty bolo yeung plastered all over the box and the assumption from the aforementioned pictures and the title of the film that this film is all about the beast from the east kickin' ass for 90 minutes br br however to my disappointment chinese hercules is to bolo yeung what no retreat no surrender was to jean claude van damme and fearless tiger was to erm bolo yeung maximum exposure on video box minimum actual screen time oh well br br the storyline is pretty basic stuff but it was well done peaceful kung fu fighter played by chen hui min accidentally kills a man and promises never to fight again he then runs away to work as a labourer on a pier where he impresses his co workers with his heavy sack lifting prowess causing them to suspect him to be a formidable fighter dont quite know how that works but never mind meanwhile the corrupt boss of the pier does a deal with gangsters giving them exclusive use of the pier as a result the workers are thrown out on their ear and forced to live on the beach where they unite against their boss the gangster boss and his hulking henchman bolo yeung br br while the film was quite watchable mainly through waiting for the next glimpse of bolo i had a few problems with it firstly the bad dubbing but of course thats a given in old kung fu films but also the film tended to drag between the various fight scenes and as for the fight scenes themselves i found them to be over long badly choreographed apparently by jackie chan badly shot and at times performed by people who didn't seem to have any martial arts ability in fact most of the fights in this film weren't 'fights' at all just people getting beaten up without offering any resistance br br finally the hero played by chen hui min i've never seen any other films with this guy in but at no point was i rooting for him not only did he look wimpy and on the verge of tears at all times but i found his insistence on not fighting infuriating i understood his reasoning but he could have saved a lot of people a lot of pain if he had done earlier what we all knew he was gonna do eventually and fight a bigger mystery was why this entire community of people were pinning their hopes on a guy they've never even seen fight br br really the big saving grace in this film was the presence of bolo yeung not only is he as huge and brutal as ever he has some great funny lines and gives the rest of the cast a master class on how to fight on film the guy oozes screen presence and you can easily see how he became a star the guy scares the life out of me but i'm sure i wasn't the only person to have watched this film who was rooting for bolo all through the end fight br br all in all then a below average kung fu film lifted several huge notches due to you know who i've never met a person who didn't think bolo yeung was great the man's a legend
<START> with a special telescope dr janos rukh boris karloff successfully proves that years ago a meteorite landed in africa containing an unknown but extremely powerful element dr benet bela lugosi form an expedition led by rukh to locate the element unexpectedly rukh discovers radium x even more powerful than radium and very radioactive and karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by just touching them the sparks really fly between lugosi and karloff in this classic science fiction film during the post world war ii era director hillyer used a few standing sets from flash gordon series which was being filmed at the same time and also inserted some footage of electrical machines from frankenstein universal kept the public unaware of the special effects being used in this great classic film karloff and lugosi were at their very best and they both enjoyed working together and will be enjoyed by future generations
<START> i have things to come on d v d and it's very clear compared to my vhs version the audio is fair but can be hard to understand at times br br i liked the movie so much that i searched for a copy of the book and found it it gave details of why some things happened the best things about the movie are the small things that i didn't notice at first such as john cabal playing with a toy airplane at a christmass party like it was a dive bomber out dateing sea power by naming a battleship dinosuar ships sunk by air power an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes swept flying wing planes strong rolls for the women through the entire movie br br there are more see the movie to enjoy them
<START> i have never seen the 1973 older highly rated version i am a nicholas cage fan by the way fine acting as usual this movie probably took all of five minutes to hammer out the whole plot i can see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party if you can't figure out the ending of this drool in the first thirty minutes you will probably find this movie entertaining this is of late the terrible rut that hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror mystery thriller genre unable to give the audience enough credit and write a fresh smart and tantalizing screenplay they dish out some creepy music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final print off to your local theater at least it didn't have the jiggling hand held camera syndrome
<START> netflix should mention this short feature on the info for silk stockings superior in every way to that over produced fluff this had much better cole porter songs and lots more energy silk stockings turned out to be a big disappointment fred was getting too old for this sort of thing though the dances and cyd are lovely i will be on the watch for the garbo melvyn douglas version of ninotchka was peter lorre ill during the making of silk stockings he seems to be very passive in the more active numbers and with less lines very glad that i ran across paree paree by pure accident made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable bob hope as a simple song and dance man' is pure joy
<START> i actually have a fondness for christopher lee but this just wasn't up to his other performances and he was one of the better actors br br the film does not live up to its premise it's not that scary it's overly melodramatic and it draaaaaags every time i thought oh here comes the good part the good part never quite arrived br br the evil ones aren't at all convincing most of the other characters were also lacking in depth br br perhaps if i'd been in the proper frame of mind i might have enjoyed some mstie fication at this film's expense but naaahhh didn't really seem to be worth the effort it wasn't really very good it wasn't really very bad it was just mediocre
<START> okay here's what i think about jack frost i looked at the morphing box for the vhs tape and i thought to myself this looks interesting i rent it and i take it home boy was i right it is interesting they put serial killer's spirits in dreams in walking corpses and inside every day machines but this has got to be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer inside the body of a snowman i liked all the friendly snowman images littering the landscape the pot holder the snow globe etc i like the actor who played jack he put some fun into a killer really not seen since freddy krugger that's right i said it freddy krugger it's that level of cool i wish some of the puppet effects were better the mouth movements could have matched better but i chalk that up to a small budget the cast does a great job there are some great one liners and scares to make any hardcore horror fan jump all and all a great story good effects great dialog and a great cast i give jack frost 9 stars
<START> this movie appears to have designed as a fred astaire ginger rogers film the plot outline dance numbers zippy music and the entire formula is there except for ginger whether it really was originally intended as a re pairing of the team is uncertain but it sure has the look of one of these films instead of the usual sidekicks for fred such as eric blore or edward everett horton burns and allen are used probably since despite being known as a comedy team they could sing and dance quite well this actually shocked me but the team were a welcome addition and some of the traditional fred and ginger numbers were done with either fred and gracie or these two along with george only once at the very end does ms fontaine dance with fred but it's very brief and with a distant camera shot br br and speaking of burns and allen i think i owe it to the team to talk about them in the film i have never been a fan of their show or their movies in general i find gracie's idiot act very annoying and i have given some poor reviews to their movie shorts and full length films however in this film i must admit that they were great not only dancing competently but i actually thought they were funny and filled the hole left by edward everett horton very nicely they were on top of their game and the writers did a wonderful job in this department br br now as for the rest of the film it's all a lot of fun and is entertaining the problem for me though was that joan fontaine was not a particularly good choice for the movie not just because she was acting outside her range after all she wasn't a singer or dancer but because she had the screen presence of a ball of lint because of this the usual balance and great boy girl dialog was lacking there was also a very charming performance by harry watson as a devilish little boy who did everything he could do to play cupid all because he wanted to win a bet and finally i loved the fun house and tunnel of love sequence it is too hard to describe but is so much fun to watch overall i did like the film quite a bit it had a lot of charm and excellent writing unfortunately it also featured a bland performance by ms fontaine that knocks off a point bringing my score for this film to 7
<START> two movies back to back which dealt with indian pows veer zaara and deewaar although veer zara was a love story of a guy who gives everything up for someone deewaar focuses on the main subject itself it is not hidden that many indian pows are rotting in pakistani jails for years for whom neither indian govt has time or sympathy nor the other side i'm sure some of pakistani pows are in india as well but let's focus on the movie full of actors some were stage actors like raghubir yadav rajendra gupta etc amitabh bachchan who plays the role of a major acted well akshaye khanna did his part well there was nothing for amrita rao to do than a few giggles and couple songs i think sanjay dutt's role was most solid even though it wasn't too long he acted really well here and his dialog delivery was also impressive if you compare it to loc which was nothing but a day long movie with story going in all directions if it had a story deewaar is a well directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all actors 7 5 10
<START> it's beyond my comprehension that so much rubbish from norway has been remastered for dvd release and still gems like this don't get a shot at recapturing their past glory i give this a 7 not because it is very good but because it is one of the few scifi films made for norwegian television this film is nothing less than a film historic gem that in so many ways foreshadows the first alien film and my word blindpassasjer was first did ridley scott or anyone in the crew see the mini series however unlikely the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar okay the budget is much lower in the norwegian film but given that it's a really well done piece of work from the desolate age of norwegian movie making which incidentally lasted until the 90s
<START> i have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as i personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film the road side bar scene in russia in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line 50 dollars you drink and talk but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could so i declined to take this speaking part on i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experience and who knows these lines could have ended up there with lines such as i'll be back and quite frankly my dear i don't give a damn had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as 'heavy 1' instead of the name of ryszard janikowski br br as time goes on i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film br br even though i spent a whole day on the set in south wales hot spot barry island no one could tell me what the actual storyline was the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it things could certainly have been worse if i'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films br br still on the positive side i got chatting to rhys ifans during one break i had no idea who he was as notting hill was yet to be released and not an inkling that he might be welsh made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production
