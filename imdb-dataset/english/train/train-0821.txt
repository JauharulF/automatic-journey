<START> excellent film from thaddeus o'sullivan featuring strong performances from a host of british and irish actors the film deals well with a thorny subject matter and effectively captures the hopelessness and grim atmosphere of 1970s belfast surprisingly realistic it does nothing to glorify either side in this conflict on one hand it shows a young catholic father trying to raise his family without getting drawn into the troubles on the other it deals with a loyalist gang who are intent on propagating violence very interesting and thankfully entertaining don't be expecting any laughs though 7 out of 10
<START> this movie has richard pryor rosey grier and others it's a curious ww2 movie and serves as a statement about racism it is worth watching to understand the fact that movies reflect how we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the period of time they portray meaning this is a 70's movie not a 40's movie ww2 still there is some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a dam the story centers on the captain learning that these men are soldiers and not just a service company there is a scene that could be from a civil war movie and not a ww2 movie that reflects what the movie is all about the black lt gives a german women a innocent peck on the cheek and the white capt becomes upset i enjoyed the movie from a curiosity stand point since the stars and the genre were interesting to me
<START> there are some excellent comments and observations on this film i was pleased to note the comparisons to fritz lang's m forget the 50's abortive remake with lightweight david wayne the real villain is not the tortured murderer extraordinarily fine performance by jeffery demunn taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims mostly children he is the objective the real villain is the stifling bureaucratic soviet system drowning in its own corrupted incompetence the frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man rea in his best role since the crying game a facile pragmatist who's willing to use the system to his advantage sutherland always successful in this kind of role a hesitant frightened but determined psychiatrist the incomparable max sydow the bumbling boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor brilliant brit actor john wood and the quiet supporting wife of the driven investigator delightful supporter imelda staunton this is one damn fine film its darkness and bleakness are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt incompetent system which works against success the is no need to dip into gore laden slice 'n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films gore is present it's a ghastly story but it adds to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being the success of the story is precisely that these were acts perpetrated by a person a human like you or i where you and i choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us our children the superb premise of this story is made manifest by an equally superb cast of excellent actors sadly i note that our australian friend didn't like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in aussie dialect well too bad this fine film sure worked for me and everyone else i've talked with who has seen it
<START> with the badly injured tony in an induced coma two things happen tony imagines himself leading the life of a salesman attending a business convention while his family and friends go through hell trying to cope with the possible loss of the big man the dream sequences are right out of an old twilight zone episode as tony finds himself transformed into an average joe trying to deal with a missing wallet and mixed up identities while on a cross country business trip his intonation as a blazer and khaki wearing schnook is more mid american and less that of an italian thug from noo joisey a nice touch the shockingly long haired hippy dippy aj whom paulie calls van helsing at one point has a nice scene with his comatose old man the best moment has the big boys trying to talk about life without tony which immediately breaks down into a territorial dispute vito gets off a line about the new dead gene possibly having been a closet case which is interesting in light of what we are about to learn about vito
<START> a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy director writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock imitation many called it a ripoff with this film and the 2 35 1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera work and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted for tv tapes br br the downside of the movie at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard is the general sleaziness of all the characters including the policeman played by a pre nypd dennis franz who has hair here br br the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit even 25 years after its release the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson if that is really her on the closeups and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies br br there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder the first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it's apparent who the killer is it's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through particularly for males ogling the naked women
<START> i was very unimpressed with cinderella 2 and jungle book 2 but this is possibly worse than both titles first of all i didn't like the animation very saturday morning cartoon only worse in some scenes i liked some of the characters namely thunderbolt and patch but the other characters like cruella were mediocre cruella was truly villainous in the original but she lost her quality in the sequel what she said was nothing at all to write home about and her animation was kind of ugly also her artist companion lars was a joke to be honest with you and roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight the voice talents were very good though especially barry bostwick as thunderbolt with the exception of jodi benson the accent ruined it for me there were some good moments but the whole plot seemed bloated for me and highly suggestive of an extended tv episode all in all a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s disney movies along with jungle book sorry i can only give this a 3 10 it just wasn't my cup of tea bethany cox
<START> i am black american and i loved this soap opera i watched it dubbed in spanish on telemundo almost 5 7 years ago the story was a true story about a black slave who's love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid whimsical way of living br br a lot of us could learn a lot from xica she took what she had nothing and saw her possibilities many would argue that she sold herself out but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children br br it was such an excellent soap opera that i thought it would be released on dvd but it's not being released this soap opera was the best soap opera ever we need for it to be released on dvd or broadcast on tv again it's playing on azteca america right now which is only available in mexico or in the us by paid cable we need it released again to telemundo
<START> jim belushi is terrific as the average joe who gets his 15 minutes in the twilight zone michael cane is the mysterious bar tender who not only listens to belushi's story but has a cure for all of belushi's middle class problems a magic potion to bring about an avalanche of changes in belushi's life br br flashbacks show a 15 year old horribly ashamed of causing his high school baseball team's championship defeat belushi goes on with his pitiful life seemingly happy but always wondering what if for what seems to be several days belushi experiences a different life one of enormous success admired and hated by others in equal measure br br this is not quite it's a wonderful life but some elements are similar and very endearing the ending is predictable but still satisfying watch for a very young cortney cox in a bit part as fatal attraction like other woman a very pleasant film
<START> first time i saw this movie was in the eighties but reviewed now this thriller is still actual some newer movies focus on similar topics but they do not match this french milestone br br a president obviously jf kennedy gets shot in an open car during a public appearance the resulting huge investigation finds the lee harvey oswald figure of this movie guilty but one member of the jury insists in further inquiry he reveals some surprising evidence br br unlike oliver stone's jfk a movie with the same plot this one does not play with emotions but concentrates in a exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits together drawing a new picture of the assassination even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene compared to jfk this movie is more reasonable intelligent and thrilling parts of the plot can be found in a lot of newer movies i had a kind of deja vu sometimes sitting in the cinema br br i comme icare is a must see its unique and brilliant and the music by ennio morricone is wonderful this movie deserves a very good ranking if it was a hollywood production it would be famous for sure br br
<START> the performances of fishbourne who appears strangely funny somehow and short featured ed harris are remarkable unlike connery's who doesn't appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a 80yr old man in fact the screenplay doesn't make sense imagine a 60 min happy ending plot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters it's more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen wrights' schools the more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets the capital punishment is not an issue here although it is a subject from the beginning it sort of fades away without further comment the subject matter and environment could have been good
<START> this review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based br br the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society but according to fred schepisi's partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous australian murder trial it was not granted to lindy chamberlain accused of killing her baby the story suggesting her innocence was unlikely a dingo was alleged to have taken it but those implying her guilt even more so and there was no solid evidence against her but the australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt and the deeply religious chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media and the media themselves of course were anything but innocent in this process so although cleared by an initial inquest they were later prosecuted and convicted although chamberlain was eventually released this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence proving their innocence something no defendants should have to produce br br 'a cry in the dark' is well acted throughout especially by meryl streep who puts on a convincing australian accent at least to this pom's ears and manages keep lindy sympathetic to us while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure the scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking because we believe in the characters as real br br regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story something i can't comment on the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the british popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership's least charitable instincts no legal system will ever be perfect but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary british tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put lindy chamberlain away i'm not a religious man but the bible still contains some killer lines if you'll excuse the pun judge not lest ye be judged is one of them
<START> i bought this adaptation because i really liked anne brontÃ«'s novel when i read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy bbc dramas but i'm very disappointed i never thought it would be as bad as that the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had br br first of all the music and songs seems totally out of place in a period drama sounds as if it's been written for a contemporary horror film and like another commentator i was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors i've seen some scenes filmed that way in north and south and it seemed all right there but in the tenant it's definitely overdone and simply annoying camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively br br most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity none of the characters were properly introduced at first the little boy gave a very good performance he's very cute and the best feature of the film br br spoilers tara fitzgerald's characterisation of helen graham made her appear cold and harsh letting no emotion pass through she doesn't seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way i just couldn't believe markham could have fell for her and i'm not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given i could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband fancy being married to such a virago besides he was the only main actor that sounded right to me toby stephens i found just ok helen graham's brother not very good br br maybe it's difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty besides what is only hinted at and left to the reader's imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the tv adaptation making some scenes both gross and comic like when huntingdon's eye starts bleeding and others far too sexed up for a period drama i mean don't we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas
<START> it seems to be a perfect day for swimming a normal family wants to gain advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this whereas the tide is rising the woman barbara stanwyck takes the car and searches for help br br john sturges' short movie 69 minutes is powerful because of unanswered questions stanwyck finds a guy who could help but there is a price she has to pay for this there is a double question the movie poses how far would you go to help the man that you love and on the other hand observing stanwyck's behaviors towards the stranger does she really love her husband like a good short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer himself
<START> thank god i watched this at a friend's place and did not pay for it the plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a tv show if you have any knowledge of computers or electronics watch out you will feel feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence br br also actress turned much music vj amanda walsh displays the worst acting i have ever seen excluding porn she's lucky that matt lanter is actually decent he's the one that carries the movie br br i hate that i wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie it's a shame that they got to call it a sequel because i was a fan of the original which was actually pretty good
<START> i chose this movie by the cover which was a bad move it wasn't funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious the girl was beautiful but the story and the acting were terrible it had absolutely nothing to do with surfing terrible movie with a surf theme that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers catherine zeta jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a resurgence just becuase she is in the limelight now being married with gordon gekko and all but if you haven't seen it don't waste your time a bad movie with great surfing real surfers and amazing beautiful cinematography was in god's hands
<START> this film describes the experiences of a couple of hit men one of them burt reynolds a prostitute and two drag queens over the interval of a few hours on one night in miami the convergent storylines eventually bring all the people together at one place and time the movie was mildly entertaining but the big problem was that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally under exposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was happening in a few scenes you can actually see where they tried to stretch the developing process to save the images somebody didn't know how to operate a movie camera amazing that this film was even released
<START> domestic import was a great movie i laughed the whole time it was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations the acting was great alla korot larry dorf howard hesseman and all the others did an awesome job because it is an independent film written by a first time writer it doesn't have the clichÃ©s that are expected of other comedies which was such a relief it was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart warming story i heard it was based on a true story if so then that is hilarious and amazing i highly recommend this movie
<START> it is so rare that i get to rate a movie without having some reservation as to whether i should have gone up one or down one but this one did the explosion rate a notch higher or one down because my brain hurt trying to create a plot no this one yeah a solid no brainer one ten
<START> 'flight of fury' is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring action film i don't expect a lot from a seagal film all i expect is to be moderately entertained for 90 or so minutes with some mindless action unfortunately this doesn't even achieve that low expectation the action scenes are few and far between the plot which is totally irrelevant in these films is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout the acting is truly abysmal bordering on embarrassing with seagal and his whispering one expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of 3rd raters i find it hard to believe that anything close to 12m was spent on this dire mess unless 11m of that 12 was seagal's salary i somehow doubt it the one moment of any interest to straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that it's mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the michael dudikoff b movies i've endured br br 1 10
<START> i am an avid b rate horror film buff and have viewed my fair share of slasher pictures so i have a substantial gauge to judge this film by it easily ranks in the upper echelon of the worst horror films the 1980's has to offer it isn't as scary as night of the demons it isn't as gory as re animator and lacks the camp value of there's nothing out there that being said this film has no value keep in mind the movie artwork is for a completely different film the stills shots on the back of the dvd box aren't taken from this film br br violence there is plenty of violence but we've seen it all before a murderer kills nubile students and the occasional facility member by slitting throats and all the other tired methods of murder that horror films utilize br br nudity none br br story the story focuses on francine forbes who wisely changed her name to forbes riley after this film was made who accepts a job teaching at a university people start to die and forbes believes the killer is targeting her is it her new heartthrob with a checkered past or the libido crazed student to be honest it is impossible to care because the script doesn't flesh out any character outside forbes br br acting terrible on all levels this slasher has the feel of a school production high school that is because college students could make a better flick than this forbes showcases a modicum of talent as does seminara as one of the students but everyone else is of the extras caliber of acting
