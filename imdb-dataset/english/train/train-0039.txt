<START> okay i didn't get the purgatory thing the first time i watched this episode it seemed like something significant was going on that i couldn't put my finger on this time those costa mesa fires on tv really caught my attention and it helped that i was just writing an essay on inferno but let me see what hasn't been discussed yet br br a twop review mentioned that tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator yeah 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons especially religious but here's one more for ya on a hunch i consulted wikipedia and guess what dante divided into 7 levels purgatorio excluding ante purgatory and paradise the stuff at the bottom of the stairs and what tony can't get to br br on to the allegedly random monk slap scene as soon as the monks appeared it fit perfectly in place with tony trying to get out of purgatory you can tell he got worried when that christian commercial death disease and sin came on and he's getting more and more desperate because christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him by the time he meets the monks he's thinking hey maybe these guys can help me which sounds like contemplating other religions e g buddhism and wondering if some other path could take him to salvation not that tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a buddhist but it appears finnerty tried that and messed up that slap in the face basically tells tony there's no quick fix as in no you can't suddenly embrace buddhism and get out of here br br tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven but at the conference entrance he realizes that's not going to be so easy for him at first i saw the name vs driver's license problem as tony having led sort of a double life what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people he feels free to have an affair with quasi melfi because he's kevin finnerty he figures out that he can fool some people with kf's cards like hotel receptionists but it won't get him out of purgatory those helicopters the helicopters of heaven are keeping track of him and everything he does br br after reading all the theories on infinnerty though it seems like kf's identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths tony could've taken in his life possibly along with the car joke involving infiniti's that made no sense to me otherwise aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out
<START> greetings again from the darkness stunning photography highlights this disney documentary and provides a glimpse into some of the harshness of animals that live in the wilderness for anyone over 40 disney and mutual of omaha's wild kingdom provided much of our insight into wild animals since our childhood back when there was no channel dedicated to national geographic or nature or animal planet br br what always fascinates is just how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures watching the elephants trudge for days nearly delirious from lack of water is oh so painful but their nighttime battle against the lions is thrilling br br some of the underwater shots are breathless the mama and baby humpbacks are beautiful and watching the great white shark attack its prey is every bit as chilling as jaws the most amazing scenery for me was the breathtaking views of the himalayas i had never seen such detail of the vastness of the range br br don't think most young kids today will be too excited by this one but it surely is one of the most beautifully photographed documentaries i have ever seen
<START> this is one of those cheaply made tv movies were the characters seem to lose all sense the premise of the story the kidnapping of a son by the boy's father is very good but the story just seems to beggar belief whenever the mother is advised not to do anything you know fine well she is going to do it it is a bit far fetched and not worthy of a viewing
<START> when i look for new cars i expect not to be shown boats when i drink fountain coke i should expect that the drink contains coke when i watch a movie that embellishes itself with the name of en excellent scientist i expect that it is in some way relevant to that person or their work this could have been people discussing my grannys' diary the material covered is relevant only in that they vaguely tirade science i fell asleep the first time i tried to watch it the second time i stopped watching it br br i love science documentaries i would rather watch them over the latest blockbuster however this falls far short of providing anything worth your time Â avoid at all costs
<START> invasion of the star creatures would definitely be in the so bad it's good category if the film wasn't quite so sexist or racist that it is such just makes it plain bad br br it has the same kind of hardline stereotypical sexism that you saw in queen of outer space and the kind of racist stereotypes in this instance native americans that you would normally find in thirties forties b westerns in terms of being non funny the same walking through the cave gag is repeated well over ten times during the course of this fairly short movie ray does do one good impression of jimmy cagney but can't make it work for two impressions of cagney in a row nor handle a peter lorre when he tries it there really aren't any production values to speak of as the star creatures make the ro man from robot monster or tor johnson in plan 9 from outer space look like creations of industrial light and magic br br this film was definitely one of a vanguard of what you would have to call early independent cinema not artsy enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of an all night drive in br br
<START> what a great gem this is it's an unusual story that is fun to watch yes it has singing but it is very nicely crafted into the story and is very melodic to hear it was so pleasant to watch i enjoyed it from start to finish br br the movie takes place in england during world war ii it is about an apprentice witch who is searching for a missing portion of a spell that she needs she uses her rough magic to transport her and 3 children under her care to various destinations to find it they are joined by her correspondence teacher who is surprised to learn that the lessons from his school actually work br br although the special effects may seem a little dated at first once you get used to them they become part of the charm of this movie in fact the movie won an oscar for these effects br br the movie is innocent and fun and it's hard not to like the tuneful songs the characters are wonderfully interesting to watch i think anyone at any age could find something to like about this movie
<START> much as we all love al pacino it was painful to see him in this movie a publicity hack at the grubby ending of what seems to have once been a distinguished and idealistic career pacino plays his part looking like an unmade bed and assaulting everyone with a totally bogus and inconsistent southern accent br br the plot spools out this way and that with so many loose ends and improbabilities that the mind reels and then retreats br br kim basinger is there not doing much her scenes with pacino are flat and unconvincing hard to believe they meant a lot to each other there's no energy there br br tea leone on the other hand lit up the screen she was electric and her scenes with pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie but not enough to save al from embarrassment
<START> the movie is about two stories one is a political murder of a call girl the other an upper class political party the crossing point is the public relation character played by al paccino as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening br br if the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama the performance of al is memorable how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man as the godfather as here as a little servant see also donnie brasco br br actually the big young lion has become a tired old one this passing of ages is very moving because it makes the audience ponders about getting old too br br but his slowness is only a make up because he can get back his energy in church scene br br maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on al's talent
<START> these two stars are the only iconic heroes villains i know that got a good tv series so let's compare br br freddy 7 movies robocop 3 movies br br freddy 1 tv series 2 seasons about 40 episodes robocop 1 tv series 1 season about 22 23 episodes br br freddy 2 extra films freddy vs jason freddy vs ghostbusters robocop 4 extra films robocop prime directives dark justice meltdown crach burn resurrection br br freddy 1 upcoming film robocop 1 upcoming film br br who's had more screen time well they've both had 7 movies 1 tv series and 1 upcoming film but freddy wins it thanks to his 2 extra films one being a fan film 17 18 tv episodes br br since this is a comment for the series between freddy's nightmares anoes the series robocop the series i would personally choose robocop
<START> i do not know who is to blame miss leigh or her director but her performance as catherine is almost impossible to watch ben chaplin on the other hand does a superior job against all odds as far as i am concerned his character is entirely too charming and appealing but certainly not shown as greedy enough to put up with leigh's character's silliness chaplin appears bemused by what cannot possibly be understood as leigh's shyness and lack of grace but rather her orthopedic unsteadiness there has to be some element of believability to his interest but as played it is incomprehensible the performances do not jibe maggie smith and albert finney are of course wonderful despite any effort to derail them the supporting cast is also a pleasure to watch what a pity too the leads don't work together because the production is lovely to look at
<START> this movie scared the crap out of me i have to admit that i spent most of the film watching through my fingers but what i saw was really scary i screamed out loud two or three times during the show br br film making wise my favorite aspects were the sound and photography the sound was particularly great and the setting was really creepy beautiful i read somewhere that it's some weird husband and wife team that made it for some reason that makes this even stranger for me br br if you enjoy the jumps and jitters of scary movies than this one is for you very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies curled up on a sofa screaming like little girls
<START> i have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru not one laugh in it ok maybe one little chuckle for the michael clarke duncan bit as the big black bald gay virgin but the rest of it was shockingly un funny on top of being void of any laughs the skits go on forever steer clear of this one if you value your time and money dreadful the worst
<START> so terrific so good i have never seen a man be more funny than eddie murphy in this stand up comedy you will see a lot of imitations more done by anyone br br if you have seen raw 1987 you will have to see delirious it's so funny it's so professional
<START> i'm actually watching this film as i write this if the following comments prove my lack of development as a true artistic film maker then so be it br br but i thought am still thinking as i'm presently viewing that this film to put it mildly is very very overrated again very br br it looks like a really really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources and who didn't pay that much attention to detail br br i don't want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking but well i just don't get it rememeber i fully admit that maybe it's me that's the idiot here not the film maker for not getting this piece of imaginative genius i rented this on a whim because the reviews were very very outstanding br br sheesh
<START> i like this presentation i have read bleak house and i know it is so difficult to present the entire book as it should be and even others like little dorrit i have to admit they did a very good show with the staged nicholas nickelby i love diana rigg and i could see the pain of lady dedlock even through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy i am sorry i think she is the best lady dedlock i am not sure who could have made a better jarndyce but i am ok with mr elliott it is not easy to present these long dickens' books oliver twist would be easier this is a long and if you don't care for all the legal situations can be dreary or boring i think this presentation is entertaining enough not to be boring i just loved mr smallweed it can be entertaining there is always a child jo will break your heart here i think we should be given a chance to judge for ourselves br br i have to say i loved the show maybe if i read the book again as i usually do after seeing the movie maybe i can be more critical in the meantime i think it is a good presentation
<START> quite average even by monogram standards this mystery a remake of the sphinx has an oddball plot which is not unraveled to much effect you'll see through it after about ten minutes the two leads have some nice breezy dialog at the outset but john hamilton is hopelessly dull as the villain perfectly cast lionel atwill originated the role and warren hymer's nitwit shtick is pretty annoying however it's worth sitting through for a five minute appearance by the incomparable mantan moreland as nicodemus the janitor who gets the better of the defense attorney during a hilarious courtroom appearance you've got to hand it to bill one take beaudine he wasn't much of a director but he would always punch up a routine programmer with some goofy vaudeville
<START> my friends and i went into this movie not knowing what to expect but hoping for the best when we came out we were only slightly more informed on what the plot of the movie actually was though not the worst movie i've ever seen i definitely do not recommend spending your money to see it in theaters maybe have a friend rent it for you it's not even worth the rental cost either if you really want to see it br br when a movie is so convoluted that you have no idea what's going on until the last five minutes there's really not much that can be said in its defense the acting was decent more than you'd expect to get from this movie and some of the shots were good but it was all bogged down by a lame plot and poor script br br this movie was actually so bad that as soon as it got out i went and purchased a ticket to see a good movie just to cleanse my mind i recommend that all of you just skip the first step and go see a good movie instead
<START> micro phonies is a classic stooge short the guys are inept repairmen working at a radio station and during some horsing around in a broadcast booth curly's perfect mimic of a recording of voices of spring is mistaken for the real thing leading to a radio contract and a zany musical party the trio's mock rendition of the quintet from lucia de l'amamore is especially entertaining no doubt this is essential viewing for stooge fans br br although the evidence of curly's failing health is visible in his face and voice his performance is amazing and it is probably the last glimpse of the old curly some fans think that a bird in the hand is the last great curly short but his coarse voice and slow movement are just too difficult to watch
<START> this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces the fall of the house of usher dance of death poem is actually quite creepy from beginning to end it is similar to some of the old black and white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example the cat and the canary the old dark house night of terror and so on boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life size dolls that terrorize the guests he dies early in the film or does he and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences i won't go into too much detail here but it is definitely a must see for fans of old dark house mysteries br br watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room br br dan basinger 8 10
<START> after viewing this film i felt the compelling need to vent a bit of my frustration selma blair is a fabulous currently underrated actress and max beesley was rather charming in kill me later the story while not exactly original certainly showed some promise none of that mattered though at all br br i don't know what her deal is but director dana lustig has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director she slowed footage down sped footage up reversed footage used awkward camera angles used annoying color filters made a zillion quick cuts jumped back and forth in the timeline and topped it all off with an obnoxious modern soundtrack of blaring junk i can't remember the last time i saw such an incompetent job of directing a film her ego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of it is crammed down their throats br br there are a couple of good scenes in kill me later which show what could have and should have been unfortunately just when things would start to show promise ms lustig would dig into her bag of film school tricks and jumble things up again it's a shame because blair and beesley had good chemistry and you could tell that the film really had a good heart 3 10
