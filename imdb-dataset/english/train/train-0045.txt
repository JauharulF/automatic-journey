<START> rather nasty piece of business featuring bela lugosi as a mad scientist with yes a renfield like assistant and his mother a dwarf and yes the scientist's wife sounds like a greenaway movie actually lol lugosi gives his wife injections from dead brides why them who knows so that his wife can keep looking beautiful he gets the brides after doing a pretty clever trick with some orchids that makes the brides collapse at the altar after another bride bites the dust a newspaper reporter just happens to be around for the scoop and decides to snoop around for a story she gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and lugosi heaven knows where the police were soon she's off to bela's lair when she meets a sort of strange looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil it all cumulates in a totally far fetched plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist but it seems that the scientist has x ray vision as he foils her plans oh no what will happen i actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure lugosi is great here his hangers on are all very very strange the story is actually quite nasty in some places which makes it all most watchable a fun little view
<START> here's an indie film i really wanted to like but ultimately could not the lack of script boldly proclaimed in the main titles really shows through and kills the picture the story is a nonsensical mess that isn't worth trying to figure out i quickly became bored within 10 minutes then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minutes hoping for the best before hitting the chapter stops to mercifully get to the end even that wasn't worth the extra effort ozark savage clearly tries too hard to be clever lifting its best sequences from evil dead 2 and the matrix as a result there's very little in ozark savage that hasn't been done before and better this film would have been much more fun as a 10 20 minute short but as a feature it just feels padded and forced of course there's no money in shorts so i completely understand the financial reasons that i assume motivated it being stretched out to 75 minutes director matt steinauer shows great promise and i wish him luck
<START> this santa movie starts off strange and i think santa might be a pedo instead of the usual elf toy makers this santa has apparently kidnapped kids from all across the globe and makes them sing a bit like characters from it's a small world i guess there are no child labor laws on the weird astral plane on which he lives it's apparently not the north pole and not on earth none of these kids seem very happy and i kept wanting to see commandos break in and rescue the tykes though i guess for some of the third world kids these working conditions were perhaps an improvement over local sweatshops i sure hope that all they do is sing and make toys br br then the scene abruptly changes to hell where lots and lots of demons dance about like they are in a busby berkeley musical this fun in put to a stop by satan who orders one of them pitch to go to earth to ruin christmas personally i thought this movie already did that the devil and his imps are actually kind of cute like hot stuff from the harvey comics but with cool evil goatees or if you are puerto rican like a vejigante mask with a goatee br br somehow a poverty stricken mexican kid named lupita a group of jerky kids who want to mug santa and some rich kid are key battlegrounds for the devil and santa so if the prince of darkness not donald trump it's the other prince of darkness can somehow make her steal and be bad he'll 'win' what we don't really know in fact as they root her on you get the impression that the film makers intend santa to be jesus as he has all these great powers and fights the devil over kids' souls later santa meets with his friend merlin he asks him to make him a special powder that makes people dream nice dreams considering how much santa laughs in the film like a demented chipmunk i assume he must use this drug a lot he immediately goes to see a blacksmith who makes him a magic key that opens all doors considering he keeps kids as his personal 'assistants' this magic key thing worries me immensely during santa's christmas eve ride you see lupita behave like a little angel one problem down santa then takes time out now to take care of the rich kid whose parents are selfish jerks he gives them some sort of crazy cocktail which magically solves their problems two problems solved this is a rare case where alcohol drugs help kids and solves problems and as for the little muggers he gives them coal frustrated with his losses to santa pitch then tries to steal the sleigh which is pulled by creepy animatronic deer when this fails he destroys santa's stash of 'magic powder' as a result santa can't become invisible to avoid dogs and gets treed uh oh how can santa take a detour to the betty ford clinic if he's stuck up a tree will st nick get down from the tree and get the monkey off his back or will the devils win if you care tune in and see however be warned that the film is bat crap crazy br br technically speaking the film is yecchy while it is in color it's really gaudy the music is mostly done on an organ which along with bad singing from the kids produces perhaps the worst soundtrack i've heard in recent memory and the story is just incomprehensible and very very very creepy devils and a santa that kidnaps kids is just plain creep tastic it's a film you should never show to kids but makes a great film to watch with friends so you can laugh at it from start to finish
<START> when i was over at hollywood video i looked through their clearance out movies and there was demonicus for five buckaroos plus fifty percent off i saw it only once before and couldn't pass up this great deal the second viewing was much better than the first the box is so cool and the music is very good if you haven't seen demonicus yet i recommend that you do or if you rented and hated demonicus do give it another chance as another viewing of it may change your mind if you seen a copy at hollywood video for the price i got it for don't pass it up as it is a great deal br br demonicus is well a very different but entertaining movie believe it or not is like watching a interactive video game with out playing it it has very low budget and actors i'm sure that nobody is familiar with we began the the video game uh i mean film with a guy and a woman some where in italy and there is a cave that actually looks like a rail road train track tunnel and she says don't go in there and what does he do the normal stuff he didn't listen to her he goes in there and find lots of gladiator artifacts and armor and a almost perfectly preserved body of a legendary gladiator named tyrannous where did the chair come from that tyrannous was sitting on and how did his body stay so good and where did the cauldron pot come from so every cave is complete with a caultron pot tyrannous is wearing his armor helmet and has a weapon or two he does the dumbest thing a person could do he puts on the helmet and is taken over by the spirit of tyrannous from there he walks around just killing all of the campers near by to bring back the real tyrannous br br now i said before its like a video game its hard to explain but it just feels like it the music even sounds like video games the acting is really terrible the actors say things like why is he doing this oh he was nuts already and fine since he's nuts i'm going home also the movie also has some major errors like a guy is running and trying to find his girlfriend in the night and is still running in the day time still searching for her with out taking a break br br this movie has some errors but it isn't a classic like werewolf but it is entertaining if you like really low budget error prone movies then you better see demonicus
<START> when i first popped in happy birthday to me i checked the timer to see how long the film was i was amazed at the length both animated and horror films share a common ground attention span of the selected audience and that should be at or right around 90 minutes anything more and you'll lose the bulk of your audience br br this 110 minutes or 20 minutes past its prime was a huge problem for me i'd like to say half of this movie could've been edited out but i would be too generous to say that go ahead and watch it and tell me how many scenes could've been edited even without being a film major br br regardless of the overstayed visit the movie was below mediocre it spent all of its time trying to be this huge mystery on which of the elite 10 is killing off the remaining friends for the most part they not only over do it but they zoom in on a face and pretty much say it's this guy no it's this gal you'll spend more time with the camera misleading you than actually enjoying the movie and don't get me started on the acting br br okay that got me started i had to laugh in the beginning trying to remember if melissa sue anderson played the character that went blind on little house on the prairie later research proved my suspicions correct because all the way through this movie she genuinely looked blind strange as an established actress she should've been the best of the group but turned out the worst the rest of the staff aside from ann bregman was pretty damn bad too but she uh took the cake br br the movie begins with a group of ten friends and one's immediately killed off barely anyone thinks twice of this dear friend's disappearance so they continue on their merry way slowly then more rapidly there are revelations about virginia's anderson the main character past and her psychologist who's a tad bit more personal and on call 24 7 apparently than most shrinks all the while more and more deaths occur br br what's funny is just as the first disappearance the more best buds vanish the less the rest care sure they give a few seconds of air time to say wow that person just wouldn't run off etc but then they're back to their sexual ways and speaking of which it's probably due to the horrid script or maybe it was i who was losing interest at minute 30 but it was really hard to keep up with who liked who of the group as they all seemed to be sexual partners of the next or someone would either be freaked out to the max by another and best friends the next scene see the creepy guy that kept a mouse rat in his pocket Â literally Â and was the most obvious suspect i'm giving the film too much credit and time but how he became part of the elite 10 i'll never know br br but i digress there's a mystery here why are these kids targets why is virginia thinking she's killed someone when it was never proved 'till the end that any of them actually has been slaughtered and why would the trailer and poster claim these killings to be six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see hell even for 1981 most of these had been shown in any of the first two friday the 13th films Â coincidentally enough friday the 13th part 2 was released 2 weeks to the day of happy birthday to me perhaps they're speaking of when they filmed it months prior but were late to the well party br br when the secrets are revealed trust me you'll have to rewind 3 4x to actually get the laughable and incoherent motives and even then put the subtitles on to get all the mumbling victim killer's words even if you get the first time it's an unbelievably outrageous and hilarious finale it's almost worth watching the whole movie again but as a drinking game br br this birthday gathering should be avoided it's a horrible and illogical first draft script Â please please know it takes multiple rewrites before the cameras role it contains either way under acting or extreme over acting and it's 100 unrealistic on how people react in extraordinary circumstances br br side note when i was a kid or say 10 11 years old i loved horror films still do oddly definite guilty pleasures but they are getting harder and harder to watch as years pass we got our first vcr and i taped as many horror films off network or edited versions tv all i remember of happy birthday to me is getting the last 10 minutes on tape which scared me to death Â and obviously gave away the big mystery on who the killer was even though i have seen other clips of this movie i think this is the first full length viewing i've had thankfully this awful movie didn't wound me as a child i am older now and i can take this trash but never again br br side note 2 that said that crazy happy birthday to me song played in the end credits and as a score throughout still creeps me out tremendously i guess this movie or last few minutes did have an influence on my childhood shame on you melissa sue anderson
<START> parasomnia has an interesting premises but the story is poorly done without any tension or even a logical approach the cast in unconvincing even patrick kilpatrick who played great roles in movies like scanner cop 2 open fire under siege 2 and eraser the rest of the cast is unknown and not very good with the exception of jeffrey combs herbert west from the great re animator trilogy but he can play roles like this in his sleep which is a little what he does here the main problem is that the actions of the characters make no sense at all the story is rather dull and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some gory scenes especially at the end br br this could have been so much better i do not get the good reviews on this one it is below average really
<START> i went for this movie believing it had good ratings firstly it is ridiculous that they're releasing a movie originally made in 2001 seven years later in 2008 here in india everything in the movie looks dated even for 2001 the movie looks like its been made on a shoe string budget there is a scene where a taxi hits a man to elaborate how low budget you can get anthony hopkins doesn't seem to know what he is doing in the film he ends up giving a long monologue towards the end if the film had bright sparks during that scene i missed it as i was sleeping on my seat nothing about jennifer love hewitt resembles a devil she wears ill fitting trite clothes and scowls at random kids as for alec baldwin a scene where he goes to meet webster for the first time is not to be missed what a waste of money as anthony hopkins rightly put it go back home and write better
<START> too much of something borrowed grade b br br super bowl sunday is one of the slowest days at movie theaters every year because of this movie studios tend to avoid releasing bigger budgeted films that weekend every few years a studio releases a counter programming female skewing movie 2001's the wedding planner to compete with the big game this super bowl weekend similarly titled the wedding date will try to find success and attract viewers not watching the game br br sick of people feeling sorry for her single woman kat ellis debra messing tv's will and grace hires male escort nick dermot mulrony about schmidt to pose as her boyfriend for her sister's wedding in london her family has been giving her a hard time about her not being married and her ex fiancÃ© of seven years who dumped her without a reason is the best man to make him jealous kat parades nick around her ex to make him see what he is missing but ultimately nick helps kat realize that she can open up and let someone love her br br the film borrows too much from similar wedding movies it is almost a carbon copy of 1999's picture perfect and mixes in scenes similar to the wedding planner and my best friends wedding the movie also has a reverse pretty women theme going for it and knowing her audience the director makes clever references to that and other films br br the wedding date has all the clichÃ©d elements of a typical wedding movie there is the stereotypical overbearing mother holland taylor legally blonde and practically plagiarized wedding speeches by the family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner the twist at the ending has been done before but it was something that wasn't completely expected the real reason why kat was dumped comes as a surprise and changes the direction of the film for the last half hour br br even though the wedding date is predictable it is able to stand on its own debra messing in her first lead role proves she can be charming and funny dermot mulrony has great chemistry with debra messing but most of his dialogue was too corny and unrealistic he is able to make best of what he is given and be able to salvage the character br br by the use of many clever puns often sexual the film is actually funny although primarily a chick flick the film has components everyone can enjoy the feel good story and humor make it the best date movie released in a long time
<START> in the standard view this is a purely awful movie however it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale i can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as i did watching this movie andy griffith's ghost dressed in native american garb dancing sends me into hysterics everytime i wouldn't waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it but if you happen to be laying on the couch at 3 in the morning and it comes on tv check it out
<START> if i could give this film a real rating it would likely be in the minus numbers while i respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible horror films seriously people buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time br br despite it being a horror film there is nothing scary about it unless the idea of seeing how many horror clichÃ©'s you can fit in one movie scares you if the rating had been higher it probably would have made for a better film in the long run br br whoever made this version of prom night you screwed up the actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren't for the questionable scripting this was a terrible waste of a cinema trip i'd sooner go and see one missed call again at least that had some plot
<START> depending entirely on your own personal state of mind when watching this christmas evil can either turn out to become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller or one of the most pathetic and infuriatingly lame holiday themed slashers ever made me personally i'm tempted to opt for the latter because i didn't bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated a cheesy and undemanding early 80's slasher with a nutcase in a santa clause costume butchering people wrong the movie actually handles about a bloke named harry stadling who's obsessed with christmas works in a rubbish toy factory and considers it to be his responsibility to determine on christmas eve who deserves presents and who deserves punishment harry's issues all started when he witnessed santa Â his daddy in a costume obviously Â caress his mommy's naked legs at a tenderly young age after that he just developed into a social outcast much to the irritation of his younger brother who's bound to snap one holi day i fully understand why certain fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie but did it really have to be so boring there are several overlong and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens i can forgive the shortness of gore and outrageous bloodshed but this movie doesn't even benefice from an unsettling atmosphere or unexpectedly demented plot twists with the notable exception of the finale i must admit also i would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazed protagonist would focus himself on lethally punishing the naughty children he doesn't and exclusively kills misbehaving adults how are you supposed to take wannabe controversial and original christmas thriller serious when santa doesn't even commit one miserable child murder that would have made christmas evil a classic whereas now it's just a forgettable and pitiable piece of junk
<START> another fantastic film from a country where due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes has no problems in creating passionate subject matter panahi takes a different approach this time around with a blend of ironic comedy and an endearing non professional cast while still getting across his message of what he sees as being inherently wrong with his country he does so without the need of a heavy storyline it is a positive take on a country in particular its people that the iranian population desperately need the greatest pity is it won't be released domestically the insular paranoid iranian government assert that this fine film maker is only successful overseas because he is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them after growing up amid revolution and watching the academics artists and educated 'disappear' over the last 25 years he shows great bravery in continuing to put his work out there the realism achieved by shooting at the actual world cup qualifier really transports you to the event the fact he shot it on 35mm is amazing as most would only attempt this project using a digital format it looks fantastic his insistence in only using non professional actors also really works in this film fine performances all round after watching many films showing the problems iran has and also the news media reporting the facts we can tend to demonise the people as well as the government this film does the opposite it shows us they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law that maybe a change for the better isn't too far away some call panahi a feminist film maker but i think he just fights for the most oppressed demographic in iran young independent women
<START> i am a kind person so i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 it was without a doubt the worst movie that i've seen in a long time there was very little plot and the deeper interesting areas that were touched upon i e what jesus may really have wanted us to know were glossed over and instead we were given heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted upon our heroine arquette total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more humane to both her character and the audience the acting was barely there and the direction was uninspired and if i saw one more drip of water or dove flying toward the camera i may have started screaming louder than patricia
<START> red skelton was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with ease br br his shows certainly brought a laughter to the american households of years back br br he would begin the show with an opening monologue afterwards we would have a variety of characters remember gertrude and heathcliff in the monologue how can we ever forget san fernando red i remember one episode where as a king red introduced his queen by referring to her as your fatness br br go know that red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life he lost a son to leukemia at age 11 or so his wife georgia died by suicide
<START> i foolishly read the back of the dvd cover of this movie in best buy about a year ago and said to myself seems funny plus it has michael clarke duncan how can i lose i proceeded to pay 15 99 plus tax for it i took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted wooden performances abound all the hilarious and outstanding performances promised never seemed to arrive after 90 minutes i hung my head in shame knowing that i could never get that 90 minutes or 15 99 back i literally almost cried as well because if that was what could be considered comedy i didn't want to believe in movies anymore my friend and i constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was over the holiday season this year i watched it with him because he didn't want to watch it alone this was my next horrible mistake because as i watched i just became angry i began to yell at the movie and i'm not one to talk to movies period everyone i know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they've ever seen my sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends but that could not save this movie even the fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on imdb is astounding the fact that its rating at the time of this writing is 3 6 is a crime against humanity
<START> generically speaking fay grim is a highly entertaining thriller featuring two of the most inexorably enjoyable names in american movies unshakably beautiful and gracefully spunky parker posey and endlessly charismatic and unavoidably hilarious jeff goldblum they have many scenes in the first half of the film in which we see these two insatiable presences volleying off of each other even radiating with charm when goldblum rolls off hartley's shamelessly epic info dumps nevertheless if one were to deconstruct fay grim one would see many instances in which countless scenes could've been squeezed for much more benefit than they have resulted in being br br this sort of filmed in joke is the sequel to hal hartley's henry fool which was made ten years earlier it has title character posey forced by cia agent goldblum to track down the notebooks that were the precious possessions of her missing fugitive husband the predecessor's titular anti hero available within them is information that could concede the safety of the united states fay first makes for paris to get a hold of them but becomes engulfed in a bona fide celebration of espionage clichÃ©s featuring everything from car bombs to ambiguous helpers to following the girl to double crosses to triple crosses br br the primary appeal of it all for me is that it's such a novel approach to the sequel of a movie about a garbageman and a struggling novelist in a small town in the original henry fool posey played a simple woman leading a very simple life hartley's talents do not reach the heights of many of the other independent newbies from the 1990s but i do admire his wild creativity in making an inadvertent nearne sister out of her giving her a terrific predicament as he did to her character's brother played by james urbaniak in henry fool as she is trapped between whether or not she may still love her overwhelming refugee husband and the problematic but forceful plans of goldblum br br hartley however is simply riding on that fragmentary idea his plot though complex and labyrinthine true to the form of the spy film it seems as if to be entirely capricious the reason i was not bored was mostly due to the pace at which the story unfolds not to mention the presence of posey and goldblum the problem with the remainder of hartley's cast is that i cannot seem to become fond of the rest of them it has nothing to do with how obscure they are compared to the relative star power of the two said charm masters but with how they don't seem to hold their own alongside them though saffron burrows certainly comes close most of the scenes not involving posey or goldblum are far too light on their feet stringing us along with info dumps we have no choice but to listen to or else be totally lost in the ensuing sequence of scenes they are shot almost entirely in tiled angles as if hartley is compensating for that implacable feeling of a lack of material br br liam aiken however playing the now teenage son of fay and henry has a certain allure about him seeming wise beyond his years certainly much wiser than any of the adult characters perhaps hartley intended that or maybe it's simply aiken's presence the problem with a hartley film is that you never quite know what was intended and what just happens to be there as scorsese said cinema is a matter of what's in the frame and what's out one has to be able to trust that what we see is a conscious decision by the filmmaker to remain in the finished film
<START> i thought the film was good in parts the start was exciting the first 30 minutes of the film were good the camera angles in the first 30 minutes were strange and i did not like it coz the were they not covering the actors entirely br br i think the last 25 minutes of the film were really not that great from which we expect a lot in case of such films br br the dialoques did not make sense and i don't think they were very witty br br i felt as if they were trying to copy films like phonebooth in terms of dialogues but failed miserably it seemed as if they many of the scenes between the actors were put for sake of it and did not make any sense to the story br br the entire film features only law and caine br br i don't think it was a waste of time its an ok film but not gr8
<START> personally i think this show looks pretty cheaply made some of the actors are terrible they over do it seem fake i can always tell how it's going to end within the first 10 minutes or less of watching because they make it so transparently clear it's not very well written either i love to watch it to laugh at it you know the saying it's so bad that it's good well that saying applies to this show i also like to watch just to see if i'm right when i guess how it's all going to end so far i've been right every time it's like a little game that i play it's nice when you are bored you feel like laughing at something
<START> i hate to even waste the time it takes to write 10 lines on this atrocity hyung rae shim is lucky that bad film making isn't a capital crime or he'd be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster i'm amazed that this film had a 75m budget but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop that shim will hopefully never get to make another movie the rest of the life and therefore not waste any more of filmgoers time i would think the actors would have gotten together and lynched him by now br br with the effects resources available to them a great film could have been made with this budget as usual the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible script and story transformers was another visual feast with a weak script but this makes it look like citizen kane
<START> i passed this one on the shelf a few times looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes with tiny names on the front and wondering if i was missing something the other night it was on one of the movie channels and i tuned in i missed nothing br br i must admit that i only watched the first 30 minutes perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that given the slow plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 i seriously doubt it br br the lead character starts the movie in classic i don't know how to start my movie style with a long tiresome monologue about how he doesn't want to get sued it's not funny it's not even remotely funny others have commented on the san franclisco bit ok a small chuckle the first time he says it then he grinds it into the ground smiling at the camera like it's the funniest thing ever written get over yourself in fact i think the talking to the camera bit was the reason i instantly disliked the film don't assume familiarity with your audience familiarity is earned much like respect br br from there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp i didn't realize he's jewish it's a discredit to jewish comedians to call this jewish humor it's just unfunny humor just because you're jewish doesn't mean you have a knack for the comedy a wasp spalding gray does a better job of self analytical humor than this guy so obviously it's not about ethnicity br br if one of the bits i had seen had worked i might have stuck around but some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with then listing them for five long minutes doesn't make a great movie br br this is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of office space don't let yourself become a victim of target marketing just say no to haiku tunnel
