<START> my favorite jackie chan movie will always be drunken master 1978 followed by this film from 1985 police story in it chan plays a hong kong super cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend brigitte lin so that she can turn state's evidence as the story goes on the gangster sends his goons to dispatch lin but chan takes matters into his own fists and feet while keeping girlfriend maggie cheung at bay like drunken master police story has many of the signature stunts and over the top martial arts action choreography that chan has become famous for climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall in his role as director chan exceeds in excellence giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action while light on the overall slapstick humor of drunken master at heart police story is just that a police story a gritty cop thriller that would be oft copied over the years to come br br 10 10
<START> have not seen this 1958 film in a very long time and greatly enjoyed kim novak playing the role as gil holroyd who is an actual witch and has an aunt named queenie holroyd who is also a witch and gillian also has a brother warlock named nick played by jack lemmon when gillian sets her eyes on shep henderson james stewart who is engaged to a girl he is going to marry gillian performers some magic spells with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride and then becomes very lust full and falls in love with gillian the story tells that a real witch cannot fall in love blush or cry and this begins to prove a big problem between shep and gillian so nick and aunt queenie decided they have to do something about this situation great film to view over and over again and a great classic film from 1958
<START> hidden frontier is notable for being the longest running internet based star trek fan series while the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like starship exeter or new voyages hidden frontier concentrates largely on story and in that regard it does very well indeed br br hidden frontier has no physical sets instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen and the backgrounds inserted digitally one of hidden frontier's greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced one of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming instead of in post production while this does save a great deal of time it's also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post production though it still serves its purpose br br while it may not be everyone's cup of tea hidden frontier is well worth a shot though you might be best to start off watching the third season since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride
<START> i had a personal interest in this movie when i was 17 and just out of high school i got a job at 20th century fox as a member of the laborers and hod carriers union at the end of my first day sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier i was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc for one or two weeks when i arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward san diego just short of there we stopped at an army base called either camp callan or camp hahn once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into camp pendleton the big marine base there on the beach we started building what was supposed to be a japanese pacific island base it took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation which included a water tank gun entrenchments sand bagged trenches and living quarters all this was at very high pay sometimes 'golden time' which was triple our regular hourly wage our food was also first rate prime rib at lunch etc which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home br br once the job was finished i waited eagerly for the movie to come out which was about eight or ten months later then i waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen then it was no more than three or four minutes maybe less of the movie's heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens a bit disappointing but still fun br br in spite of the disappointment i enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since i learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and fox was paid on a cost plus basis which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there bob weverka
<START> cat soup has two hello kitty type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife where anything can happen and does this mind tripping asian short uses no dialog substituting word balloons instead there is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself and make sure no one under 10 is in the room dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes honest perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in and also ride but like practically everything else in this film that silly picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end
<START> a movie about vixen erica gavin who has a mountie husband who she loves but she loves sex too in the course of the movie she gets multiple men in bed including her husband and brother also there's a tame lesbian sequence br br this film put russ meyer on the map and was i believe the first critically acclaimed x rated film ever it was a big hit when it came out unfortunately it doesn't date well br br it is well directed and erica gavin is just great whatever happened to her and it was very colorful but by today's standards it's extremely tame i'm surprised it has an nc 17 rating now there's no hardcore sex and it only has topless females and no male nudity at all also it's sadly pretty dull and the addition of politics at the end was confusing and pretty silly it is worth catching though to see what was considered very shocking in 1968 purportedly i saw the cut version which has an r rating but i've heard only a few seconds here and there are missing br br meyer's next film beyond the valley of the dolls is much better and dates very well catch that instead
<START> i'm not sure if it is available worldwide but if anyone who's deciding what is supposed to be put on videotapes and distributed in video clubs is reading this please please buy it if i wasn't clear get the movie into videostores br br can't be explained must see
<START> the world is facing imminent destruction and a suicide mission is sent to the sun to avert catastrophe by firing a bomb into its fiery heart yes it's solar crisis aka crisis 2050 which burned up a huge chunk of change that's never apparent on screen back in 1990 and returned barely enough to buy a happy meal for each of the cast in japan before going straight to video remember them in a re edited version credited to one alan smithee the plot hook's pretty much the same as sunshine suicide mission to the sun saboteur on board logic cast adrift except that this time they're not trying to reignite the sun but to prematurely detonate a solar flare before it can reach earth with a talking bomb voiced by paul williams who wants to be promoted so the crew will take him more seriouslyÂ given that the cast also includes jack palance at his most dementedly ott charlton heston at his most rigid top liner tim matheson at his most anonymous the original hills have eyes' unforgettable michael berryman you may not remember the name but you do remember that face and peter boyle as the industrialist out to sabotage the mission because er if it succeeds the world will be saved but his share price will go down you'd expect if not a laugh a minute at least a laugh every reel no joy this is the worst kind of bad movie a boring one the fate of the world may be hanging in the balance but the whole film is shot with a complete lack of urgency or momentum at the same unvarying deadly slow pace there's low key and there's walking through it but here the cast don't even do that instead they just stand still looking at screens in near darkness for most of the time you keep on hoping for paul williams' talking bomb to suffer an existential crisis but instead the film just stands there doing next to nothing literally this is one of the most inert movies ever made Â so inert that if clive owen had been cast he'd almost have looked lively by comparison even a poorly explained suicidal repair attempt fails to raise a fritter of interest since it mostly involves yep the cast just standing still looking at screens in near darkness even when the bomb prematurely goes into countdown before being launched they deal with the new crisis byÂ standing still looking at screens in near darkness as if they had all the time in the world merchant ivory films have better action scenes br br things aren't much livelier down on earth where the movie spends most of it's running time with matheson's son chuck's grandson corin nemec trying to hitch a ride to the spaceport across an arid landscape with palance's insane desert artist looking for that note out there while the chicks still dig me while waylaid by rejects from a mad max ripoff and evil corporate suits who track him down so they canÂ release him on a nice beach just don't expect logic if you haven't already guessed that much best moment a ditzy girl in a bar describing jack palance as an old guy with white hair and a face like rotting leather though chucky baby taking out the villain's aircraft with a bazooka fired from the hip from an office window or beating up a barfly who likes his beret are welcome morsels of camp in a film that for 99 of it's running time offers a whole lot of nuttin' richard c sarafian's slightly longer original cut that played in japan offers an additional six minutes but cries out to be cut down to a more manageable 17 minutes the director of vanishing point must have thanked his lucky stars when the re edit gave him an excuse to take his name off the film a film so bad it's not good and painfully unfunny with it
<START> i vaguely remember ben from my sci fi fandom days of the '60s i was doing several interviews bios of obscure actors actresses most notably ben actress fay spain and jody fair who played angela in 1961's the young savages ben was one of the people at a low key sci fi con in chicago about 1970 when i had a nice chat with him and his career and life all these were published in some now long forgotten fanzine of the day wish i still had copies of those interviews but time marches on and any of those people surely wouldn't' remember me at all so many years later ben was a really nice fellow ekeing out a living the cons of those days didn't even pay their guest unless of course they were big name stars and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars at most good to know ben's still alive kicking how 'bout a remake of creature but 50 years older ugly then uglier now
<START> the trailers get you to the movie but the movie just wasn't worth my 8 50 it has some good effects but the storyline yech i like tommy lee jones and will smith as actors they have both done some good films but i wish they hadn't added this one to their resume's to be honest the book is better
<START> intriguing exciting dramatic explosive complex epic words that only touch the tip of the iceberg in terms of the grand story that is lost being told br br from the acting down to the rare visual effects lost is the essential show on television for fans of science fiction fantasy action adventure and lots and lots of mystery br br each cast member is so well chosen and so good in their roles that you either love them or hate them or downright wish them dead br br the visual effects when used which is rare are actually quite well done considering the usual production of shows be it the smoke monster to the polar bears lost is believable in terms of eye candy br br as far as story goes nothing can compare to the vast complexity this show has made viewers like me endure beginning to end continuity is virtually perfect characters are developed and the ever evolving story slowly gives the answers to its questions so many crave br br overall there is practically no flaw in lost it does for dramatic sci fi television what arrested development did for comedy it has set the bar br br i highly recommend lost to those that are patient intellectual and love every moment of the ride no matter how long it takes to reach the end br br see this show
<START> he really lost the plot with this one none of his distinctive trademarks here at all an uninteresting plot and completely terrible acting make this his worst film in my opinion even his trademark gore is gone bar one scene in an operating theatre oh well at least his next film 'nightmare concert' showed that he could still shock when he wanted to
<START> i also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago first i'm going to say that it looks great cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer i just wish the movie had been as good as it looks i would not call this a horror movie putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie there's no mystery there's no suspense you know who did it the entire time br br it's a drama you know what's going on with both sides the entire movie the acting was okay i guess but nothing special br br and the tagline revenge can be deadly really they should have check how many hundreds of horror thriller movies have that exact same tagline br br it pains me to say some of this but i know a lot of the people who worked on this movie and i know they don't want people blowing smoke up their ass so i give my honest opinion
<START> i happily admit that i'm a sucker for a beautiful film and sufficiently inventive camera movements and angles can be enough to keep my interest in a fairly long film not one the length of gojoe though even though it had some of the most remarkable cinematography i've seen since the korean period piece musa however gojoe provides far more than just beautiful images as does musa don't which to imply a contrast it's second greatest strength is superb acting and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophy i must admit to being quite unsure what the point was it was trying to make in the end but it definitely provokes some thoughts along the way vague ones but definitely thoughts p br br one department in which the film could have been better is the action there's a tremendous amount of bloodletting in the film but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic close ups and frequently obscured by objects in the foreground it does create some very intense and impressive visuals but it would have been nice to see some more actual moves something to make it more believable that the villains could just wade through entire armies laying waste to everyone br br still the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful films i've seen for quite some time recommended
<START> the costumes and make up were grand there were some exceptionally funny lines and the role was made for jim carrey carrey did as good a job as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing sure this was mostly a movie for kids but if you are going to spend this much money making a movie you really ought to at least give the story enough body to go beyond that of dr seuss i expected more from ron howard it's worth a see but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a major classic by any measure
<START> another downey must see if you are an obsessed fan like me you have got to see this movie he plays alex finch a 22 year old yale grad who realizes that the life he just came into is the life he left 26 years earlier alex is the re incarnation of louie jeffries a no nonsense lawyer happily married to corrine cybil sheppard louie is killed on their one year anniversary when he is hit by a car he demands to go back only this time in the body of alex finch enter robert downey jr a lot of confusion and a lot of laughs br br although this movie is 15 years old it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as re incarnation and if so how often to you meet the same souls life after life i don't know the answer but i do know that you need to see this movie it is a riot and downey looks so good in a tuxedo this film makes you believe in love and true love never dies it just gets recycled
<START> the treasure island dvd should be required viewing in any film production course it's a textbook example of how not to make a movie watching the movie and then listening to the writer director's commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them call me old fashioned but i think of movies as a means of communication and communication isn't complete if the audience doesn't know what the hell the director is talking about the director's avowed purpose is to make a movie void of hollywood conventions among those conventions alas is consistency of character and clarity of concept the director himself realizes that audiences often don't understand points where he has purposely avoided a hollywood clichÃ© however he never seems to grasp the idea that clichÃ©s exist for a reason they are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly it's fine to avoid them but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea not simply eliminated the film is built on an intriguing premise rich with potential two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of wwii soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them someone with less disdain for the hollywood convention of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea this film certainly isn't it the puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script in particular i'm becoming increasingly impressed by gonzo who plays the lively corpse in a number of muppet films he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet
<START> i am a huge ziyi zhang fan and will go to any film to see her which is what took me to purple butterfly as much as i wanted to like this movie i have to agree with many others who have commented on it it is very confusing and also extremely slow because all of the film appears to have been shot with a hand held camera significant portions of it are out of focus br br the film has very little dialog and what there is doesn't tell you much there are endless scenes of people just standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other with no conversation the way the film time shifts is also very confusing and hard to follow even having read a number of reviews beforehand and having a general idea what the film was about i still had a difficult time understanding what was going on br br i knew beforehand that the movie was not remotely similar to previous ziyi zhang starring films but was looking forward to seeing her in something different but unfortunately i was ultimately disappointed she never smiles in this film although admittedly most of the time she doesn't have anything to smile about i could have done without the sex scenes as they were about as sexless and without any obvious feeling between the participants as you could hope to find
<START> watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of sandler truly a slow and painful death br br 'bought the dvd in the 5 88 bin at wal mart but the thought that keeps echoing in my head is how can i get my money back br br the most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat just does not sink br br best constructive suggestion mystery comedy theatre you know that show on the scifi channel in which some guy and his muppet machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks mystery science theatre immediately spin off a comedy program and feature this flick without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck i fear that viewers may actually begin following sandler with ice picks and chainsaws br br
<START> when i was six yo i learned about a series called los campeones and even if i was just a kid i did everything i need to convince my parents to let me watch the champions and the avengers once every week i think that was the golden age of english series i already own the complete cycle of the prisoner but lasted also a few years later with the tomorrow people the worst witch i just me or this is harry potter in girl of course before as much as i want the campions to be in zone 1 or zone 4 i'm also waiting for dr who pack the whole series in a set of uhm maybe 300 dvd's please i couldn't expend more for it 8 people of tomorrow and several other 'low budget' but great stories to be available within my reached zones i speak and understand english but not all my relatives do including my parents whom introduced me into these great stories i hope someday someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as i originally view them dubbed or subtitled but in the same format i saw them remember zone 1 or 4 are ok with my tv set
