<START> you know that feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a film that's trying so hard to be a serious thought provoking piece of cinema and fails miserably when you can't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen house of the dead struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema br br from start to end house of the dead manages to recreate the feeling like you've just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it's curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept it is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size which they exploit shamelessly whereas the males for their hardcore kick ass attitude i honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture uwe boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie at least then we'll get better actingÂ however not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film it is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as these are zombies pure and simple and no cap'n we must not go there it's evil br br we all know that zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning at best they are a harmless two hours of action blood and closet terror trash yes but entertaining trash not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins according to imdb house of the dead received such bad reviews that no danish cinemas bought the movie if only we could have had the same privilege br br final score 1 10
<START> i watched this movie and hoped for something to get better the entire time what is so great about a guy with no emotion yawn br br you never see alex show emotion for anyone other than his son yeah i know that this is why his son is the only one to cause him to lose his temper if you can call it that i get it br br characters are undeveloped relationships aren't given enough time to be understood in one scene sarah says they won't fall in love and the next time we see her she's talking about how his death really shook her up because they were so close logic synapses abound in this film br br it's like someone watched boogie nights and wrote this part to mimic little bill even the scene where he loses his temper is the same as when little bill shoots his wife down to the facial expression or lack thereof yes william h macy is good at portraying a man without emotion been there done that can you say magnolia br br this movie didn't only lack emotion it lacked substance a good script developed characters and a plot and it certainly lacks my recommendation br br a
<START> how can a director that makes such great films as poltergeist and the texas chainsaw massacre make such rubbish as this i got this film off a friend and he didnt want it back its so bad how this can be classed as horror i will never know br br 2 10
<START> the secret of kells may be the most exquisite film i have seen since the triplets of belleville although stylistically very different kells shares with triplets and the jaw dropping opening 2d sequence of kung fu panda incredible art direction production design background layout and a richness in color that is a feast for one's senses kells is so lavish almost gothic in its layout somewhat reminiscent of klimt wonderfully flat in general overall perspective ornate in its celtic illuminated design yet the characters are so simplistic and appealing and it all works together beautifully you fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them you are so drawn to every detail of the story and to every stroke of the pencil brush what tomm nora ross paul and all at cartoon saloon their extended crews have achieved with this small budget very small crewed film is absolutely astounding the groundswell of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal this film is breathtaking and the buzz amongst our colleagues in recommending this film is spreading like wildfire congratulations to kells on its many accolades its annie nomination as well as its current oscar qualifying run they are all very well deserved nods indeed

<START> i am amazed that movies like this can still be made i watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and i can say that this is one of the best i ever seen never thinked that a movie of 146 minutes can make me think about it on and on br br washington charismatic and intense as ever plays creasy a washed up ex counter terrorist agent who's taken to the bottle once he's assigned to protect young pita dakota fanning in mexico city his emotional and redemptive arc is jump started in the way only an adorable little girl can provide inevitably pita is kidnapped by thugs and creasy decides that most of mexico city must pay the price for daring to take away his character's teddy bear clutching catalyst yes he has become a man on fire br br you must see this movie
<START> in an attempt to cash in on the success of universal's horror films majestic pictures hired several popular actors from the current genre and put them in this effort that realistically speaking is nowhere near as good with that this is still worth everyone's time and it's a heck of a lot of fun to view and in my opinion it's better than most of what is supposed to pass nowadays as horror story takes place in the small german town of klineschloss where the bodies have been piling up completely drained of blood and with suspicious puncture marks burgermister gustave schoen lionel belmore shouts it's vampires but the local police chief karl brettschneider melvyn douglas thinks it's a madman who's responsible and he vows to catch him br br spoiler alert the burgermeister and most of the towns folk think that the local kook herman glieb dwight frye who loves bats and frequently talks to them is the one they are looking for and they chase him until he falls to his death in a cave the one who is responsible for the killings is dr otto von niemann lionel atwill who has created a new form of tissue mass that feeds on blood and he accomplishes this by having some sort of mind control over his servant emil robert frazer who goes out at night to collect the blood dr otto has a pretty assistant named ruth bertin fay wray and an annoying aunt named gussie maude eburne but they have no clue what he's up to but karl eventually become suspicious when one of the murders takes place after herman's death br br frank r strayer was never confused with being james whale but he was a pretty competent director who ended up directing most of the blondie films in that series and with this film he uses the same sets from the old dark house which was also filmed at universal i'm the first to admit that this film is downright clumsy at times but it's practically impossible to resist a film that has a cast like this including frye who is pretty much doing his renfield role only this time he befriends bats and strokes them and keeps them in his pocket for safe keeping one thing that just doesn't make sense is the mind control that dr otto has over emil as the film never explains this and i had a strong sense that this was some sort of nod to the cabinet of dr caligari but on the other hand it's probably just the weakest part of the script there are a few other tidbits that i noticed including the chase of frye to the big caves which is obviously an early shot of the infamous bronson canyon where numerous other films have been made and also wray's brown hair which is her true color true horror film fans will appreciate this more than others but i think this is a fun film to view for everyone and with a cast as attractive as this it's well worth a look
<START> when i first saw the preview for this movie i really couldn't wait to see it the plot seemed good and the setting was great i mean a slasher movie that takes place on prom night great idea and the plot a high school teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students goes crazy gets arrested and escapes three years later on prom night prom night a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable turns into hell however i saw it and was extremely disappointed it was not only the worst horror movie i have ever seen but it was one of the worst movie in general that i have ever seen first of all it wasn't even scary there was not one moment in that movie when i jumped out of my seat also the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull all the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats also there was absolutely no gore its rated pg 13 the scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl he slits her throat and blood splatters on the sheets hanging around them they don't actually show him cutting her throat br br next you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie he isn't mysterious creepy or scary he's just this guy who kills people br br also everything in the movie was so clichÃ© an example is when at the end the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment the detective shoots and kills him also every single thing in this movie was so predictable the victim after seeing the guy with a knife runs for her life hides thinks she gets away and then the killer just pops out and kills her br br finally the sequence of the movie was extremely bad the guy goes into the hotel kills a few people the bodies are discovered someone pulls the fire alarm and everyone evacuates the main character forgets something in her room has an encounter with the killer runs and escapes thats it she and her boyfriend go home the slasher kills the guards patrolling the house finds the girl then gets killed by the detective the movie sequence was so stupid and clichÃ© br br if your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good trust me don't waste your time or money no wonder this movie was being shown in the smallest theater in the movie theater my friend and i along with these two girls sitting in the back were the only ones in the theater that should have told me something about the movie beforehand
<START> according to john ford's lyrically shot fictional biopic of abraham lincoln's life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in the worst way ford's camera has only praising views to reveal of mr lincoln's early life but for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames ford has a unique eye for telling a story the film sings of the life of a hopeful young man henry fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever lincoln to a tee one of his best roles br br the film concerns two young men brothers on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed in classic angry mob style the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them until honest abe steps into the fray he charms them with his humor telling them not to rob him of his first big case and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys lawyer what follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom murder dramas thereafter as abe cunningly interrogates witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing links br br the film plays out like many john ford movies do a tablespoon of americana a dash of moderate predictability a hint of sarcasm that you aren't sure if you put in the recipe or if ford did it himself despite the overtly 'hollywood' feel of the film and overly patriotic banter alluding to lincoln's future presidency the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed if you can take your drama with a grain of salt
<START> a concept with potential and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together but br br rudolph's glowing nose didn't require the explanation offered in this film much like the force in the star wars films didn't need the explanation of medichlorians in the bloodstream but mainly the film left me cold because of winterbolt's over complicated plot to destroy santa he's got the power to put suggestions into people's minds so why does he do things in such a roundabout way breaking the magic of rudolph's nose framing rudolph threatening to melt the frosty family the comedically exaggerated plots of pinky and the brain and phineas and ferb's dr doofenshmirtz which are done that way on purpose and played for laughs seem simple and straightforward compared to winterbolt's which we're expected to take somewhat seriously br br there is a particularly and amusingly strange moment when a character throws her two guns at the bad guy like boomerangs i understand if they don't want to have guns being shot in a family film but then why have guns in the first place
<START> i've bought the feast of all saints and it's not truly a horrible movie but a lot of things could have been better it had a lot of historical value played out by very talented actress actors and it's not an everyday occurrence that actors can play out such a role and have it be somewhat believable there were some parts that were a little mediocre and confusing but i wouldn't say that the entire movie was horrible once you think about that capturing 1800's new orleans and making something out of it it pretty hard and much harder to get actors who can strongly signify those parts but the only big problem i had with the movie was that most of the actors who did play the free people of color were mostly light skinned africans not very universal in casting others who weren't light skinned one of the old creole stereotypes that still exists whomever did the casting could have picked a wider variety when it came to hue despite many creoles are color conscious rather picking actors that looked near white in a sense could have been more thought out the actors did a great job the script could have better written and overall i found the performances were very believable
<START> i think it is a nice movie i think it is a very romanian movie through scenery and atmoshpere i think it was not intended to be sensual sensuality is a result not a purpose i think it is very natural i think it is humane i think it was interesting i think the actors never made me think waw lame acting they are not sean connory co neither is the film a block buster they are like the movie normal ppl that can act i think the movie reached its intention i think it made me feel things or feel them again i think i'm not objective br br i really enjoyed it that i know
<START> when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky and i'll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong while every movie has its flaws the night listener had an exceptionally low count br br if you read the last review it was hard since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done unfortunately if you read more than 3 lines into that same review you discovered the poster's reason for disdain he she does not like the fact that the director is gay or that the production team smokes crack apparently br br so despite the fact that i have never written a review before i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits not the sexual orientation of its director let's go over a quick checklist first 1 great plot absolutely i won't give a shred of it away but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials this is a thriller not a horror and it should be approached as such the story really will amaze you even more so because it's true and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events br br 2 wonderful acting oh yes robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type cast and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of well i'll let you see for yourself br br 3 excellent direction certainly now unlike the other poster to which i referred i actually know something about direction i've been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years of course i really don't think that makes a lick of difference the only thing that matters is if you like the direction but i thought i should simply establish once again that i'm basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant for example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team lol br br patrick stettner's direction was moody and dark and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so sought after feelings of tension and release rather than the messy fast paced camera work and quick cuts we're so often subjected to today some people can truly show you a story through their camera while other's feel as if they have to make the story with the camera i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized which is as an eyeball through which we all see br br 4 lighting cinematography and editing great all around i've already wrote so much and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs so i'll just wrap it up br br in short go see this movie don't listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it especially if they're so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1 4 of the way through their post enjoy the show ben
<START> it is difficult to find any positives in this movie seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort hence we are treated to a full showing of galaxy which is the lamest excuse for a movie in history the police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms more action shots of the two cops a lot less of galaxy would have been the way to go of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched rerun ms albright does excellent looking sexy her acting is first rate ms stabs whom i had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very desirable but seems to lack basic acting talent apart from ms albright this is real garbage
<START> this film came out 12 years years ago and was a revelation even for people who knew something of the drag scene in new york the textbooks on drag performance say nothing of these vogueing houses anthony slide's 'great pretenders' says nothing julian fleisher's the drag queens of new york an illustrated field guide with its flow chart of influence that pulls together julian eltinge minette the warhol queens and the 90s club scene and postdates the film ignores the houses completely even laurence senelick's the changing room the closest thing that we have to a definitive book on drag performance rushes quickly past the film and does not give the background information that one would have expected from it br br i understand from the film itself and various articles i found on the web that this house system goes back decades the major film performance by a house member prior to 1990 seems to be chrystal la beija in the queen 1968 the historical context is the biggest missing part of paris is burning br br the film is valuable because it focuses on a scene otherwise being ignored it is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989 the unfortunate fact that venus xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending but this is not the only film about transsexuals to include a real life murder as we now know dorian corey had a mummified corpse in her literal closet but this did not come out until three years later br br of historical importance but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary film that provides more context
<START> overall the film is ok i think it's better than sepet and much better than gubra in term of its story its sentimental value br br there are a few scenes that makes me touched yes i agree that the boy mukhsin did his acting very good brilliant i can say that his acting is almost natural br br however the song 'ne me quitte pas' by nina simone really 'menaikkan' my 'bulu' 'roma' br br i love the song both the song ne me quitte pas and hujan i just downloaded the song beautiful br br and salute to yasmin the movie's ending credit makes me touched again we can see how yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique way br br i think the movie deserves that grand prix of international jury at berlin film festival br br i give 8 5 out of 1o stars
<START> this film needs to be seen the truest picture of what is going on in the world that i've seen since darwin's nightmare go see it and if you're lucky enough to have it open in your city be sure to see it on the big screen instead of dvd the writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the ideas to come through though hardly perfect joan cusack is amazing and the rest of the cast is good too it's inspiring that john cusack got this movie made and i believe he had to use some of his own money to do it it's a wild absurd ride obviously made without the resources it needed but still succeeds jon stewart steven colbert snl even bill maher haven't shown the guts to say what this film says
<START> saw it at the philadelphia gay and lesbian film fest br br what can i say against my better judgment i liked it but it seemed to me that that acting was a little weak mostly i noticed this from the family of the teen boy i mean the script wasn't stellar to begin with but the actors didn't make me believe the relationships br br the plot is also predictable br br nonethelss i liked it the characters are likable and the plot is not challenging or upsetting it's sweet the characters care about each other and i don't count it as fifty minutes ill spent br br but i don't recommend it
<START> this is my first comment on imdb website and the reason i'm writing it is that we're talking about one of the best films ever 'ne goryuy ' will make you laugh and cry at the same time you will fall in love if you're not a fan yet with georgian choir singing tradition and possibly you will accept the hardships of your own existence and just feel good after watching it what i like a lot about this film is that actors in the non leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and are just as interesting and important as the central character the film is starring vahtang kikabidze who is great but you will remember every single face around him in the film you will find yourself quoting their lines that have become household names for so many russian speaking people a film to live with simple yet deep you will want to watch it again and again
<START> the marquis de sade egypt ancient gnostic cults robert englund in a dual role gratuitous sex and nudity murder and mayhem on paper tobe hopper's night terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun entertaining flick given the ingredients it's not it is a plot less incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment there is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of de sade who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local christian archaeologist and kill her that is pretty much it i think it has something to with the gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness dream sequences and erotic encounters intercut with scenes of englund as the imprisoned de sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery it seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their pretensions were they are buried in the cheesiness bad acting sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads br br there aren't too many good points robert englund is fun to watch as always and the lead actress zoe trilling whilst not very talented is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching night terrors is a chore at least i got to see the movie from which the when you're as criminal as i bit from the australian film certification ratings guide that was on the front of so many vhs tapes from the nineties came from
