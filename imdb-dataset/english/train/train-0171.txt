<START> this is an hilarious movie one of the very best things about it is the quality of the performance by each actor from the largest role to the smallest each character is vivid unforgettable and so understandable it can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve
<START> this is a unique and bold film it's energetic with highly developed characters very good performances br br i love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think br br bret carr dares to look inward ask questions and dig underneath the surface by the nature of the film it practically demands that the viewer look inward as well it can take some courage to do this i can see how some close minded people might find this quite disturbing however i found it thought provoking much more than just entertainment br br bret carr is truly an original filmmaker with vision i am curious to see what he will do next br br watch him
<START> it's hard to believe that this is a sequel to henry fool hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies while henry fool is refreshing witty comical fay grim is slow boring and doesn't go anywhere where has the wit gone i am baffled br br it is 10 years since i saw henry fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory fay grim is painful to watch this is no fault of the actors who are good parker posey or great jeff goldblum the blame lies entirely with the plot the dialog and even some of the filming low budget is no excuse a huge disappointment br br sorry i couldn't pay attention to the plot i was so bored so disappointed if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy henry fool so much the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other there is no continuity in the characters' personalities it's all a fraud to entice fans of henry fool to watch the sequel br br i'm switching this off now henry in some sort of jail with a taliban
<START> the soloist has all ingredients to impress the academy its director joe wright has already authored a best picture candidate the leading actor robert downey jr starred in a widely praised superhero film finally the movie itself is a drama when it was mysteriously pulled from release in late 2008 filmgoers and critics were baffled now that i've seen it i assure you universal didn't just delay this film to promote iron man oscar buzz the soloist is a weak drama with no external conflict that is vastly inferior to any 2009 best picture candidates br br downey and co star jamie fox aren't to be blamed for this mishap joe wright is largely at fault but even he can't save a lifetime story many movies are too complex and alienate viewers this one is unusually simple it's a movie about a newspaper reporter steve lopez downey who befriends a homeless musician nathaniel ayers jamie fox that's it ayers is schizophrenic and doesn't resonate with lopez's traditional approach to friendship the two become friends they begin this movie as acquaintances and are bffs by its end tension consists of moments like this will ayers let lopez take him to the homeless shelter this material would have been better suited as a made for tv production rather than a feature film br br wright includes many scenes of cheap humor to obscure the lack of content lopez battles yard defiling raccoons in what i consider a sub plot do you remember when this happened in atonement or pride and prejudice those films were structured enough to permit an occasional joke but nothing so prolonged ayers' back story is fleshed out when it doesn't need to be worst of all these scenes are not connected and appear at random intervals it's a way of admitting that the main story carries little appeal nathaniel was a violin prodigy with a tough upbringing i was too this is a fabricated attempt to create sympathy with ayers when most of us already have it he's a homeless schizophrenic for crying out loud the movie somewhat conveys humanity's love for music like amadeus and beethoven lives upstairs it isn't as effective as either of those pictures however the entire film is hinged on ayers' schizophrenia it ultimately is how he interacts with everyone else his being a musician is a nice touch but hardly worth including the film doesn't incorporate this characteristic fully into his persona take music out of amadeus or beethoven lives upstairs and no film remains the soloist is more about friendship in general than music nathaniel could be a writer or film critic and few lines of dialog would need to be seriously altered br br this is only joe wright's third film and his first that isn't a romance staring keira knightley let's hope this film isn't an indication of how limited his abilities are there are stylistic nods to his earlier works but the soloist is much weaker than either of them in his defense universal should not have agreed to widely release this picture this film seems tailored for imagine entertainment distributors of changeling i wouldn't be so disappointed with it if had a limited release its poor box office performance may inhibit better dramas from being distributed nationally
<START> haven't seen this film haven't even heard of this film it wouldn't surprise me one of the few truly independent films produced in the last ten years no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution the independent company kino films gave boesman and lena a very limited run with virtually no promotion and the majority of major film critics didn't even bother reviewing it i guess a movie based on a one act one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in today's market and it's the intelligent film lover's loss br br for the record both angela bassett and danny glover deserved ocsar nominations as did the cinematographer but the film received such little fanfare that i can't even blame the academy on that one this is a film that is challenging thought provoking and heartbreaking and it actually requires the audience to meet it on it's own terms taking that into consideration it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment director john berry wisely does not attempt to dress up athol fugard's play sure we're given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots but the film version of boesman and lena remains on the whole a story of two people living in inhumane conditions br br stripped of their basic human rights boesman glover and lena bassett have no one left to attack but each other a third character joins them for awhile willie jonah amazing in a largely silent role but the film's focus never strays from the title characters and what they've become bassett and glover give brave performances as the broken couple performances that simply could not be improved upon vigorously and brutally stimulating both intellectually and emotionally boesman and lena deserves to be rediscovered of home video hands down the best film of the year 2000
<START> john waters has given us a genuinely enjoyable film this certainly isn't without its shocking waters esque moments but it is tamer than his older culty stuff such as pink flamingoes pecker harkens back to john's early mainstream stage in that it reminds the viewer of the same kind of humor that was evident in polyester overall a really fun comedy with some great moments
<START> this was allocated to the fans as the winner takes all match occurred between two separate companies the world wrestling federation and the alliance an amalgamation of former wcw and ecw superstars because the final match to duduce the superior company was a tag team match the wrestlers were confined to tossing opponents from each side of the ring to another each wrestler concludes that in order to debiliate their opponents and to intensify the match interfernce is necessary each wrestler merely pummels an opponent with punches executes a special move and tags in a partner the storyline had previously been tarnished by the subterfuge of vince that a member of the allance would be fradulent and join the wwf it was obvious with that statement that the wwf would prevail overall very innovative storyline but poor execution which is not the scarcity of the wrestlers because the match format is tag team the remaining matches are just revolting br br edge versus test potent big boot by test but this did not display the true talents of both stars br br al snow versus christian good match but superflous to the pay per view br br taji versus william regal the worst match of the night br br immunity battle royal this was an outstandingly fun match to watch but because the main stars of both companies were involved in the main event only a wrestler who characteristically appears on heat and is probably a wcw light heavyweight reject i e the hurricane who is merely hired as an entertainer br br hardy boyz versus dudley boyz the best match of the night jeff hardy executed a swanton bomb from the summit of a cage and through a wooden table and matt was wedged into the cage which appeared to be extremely painful br br because stone cold was the wwf champion rob van dam was the hardcore champion and kurt angle was a mole in the alliance all fundamental stars in the main event on the faction of the alliance were granted work after the match's outcome except for booker t who recently attacked a wrestler on raw and will inevitably be given work shane mcmahon will return to television somehow and everyone desired to witness the downfall and demise of the alliance to see stone cold out of work the wwf has done much better a match in which all tiltes were brought to one faction would have been better and what ever became of casket and iron man matches
<START> here italy i write from venice why cancelated the abc should have given it a chance to build an audience the cast w hope davis campbell scott erika christensen zoe saldana jay hernandez and bridget moynahan is one of the best i've seen in recent we need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless drones i hope that abc will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up please sign online petition to abc http www petitiononline com gh1215 petition html please sign online petition to abc http www petitiononline com gh1215 petition html
<START> julie waters is always marvelous but adrian pasdar is a positive revelation in this wry gender bent comedy about a transvestite who cannot suppress his obsession and the changes he goes through when he's discovered unerringly eschews the vulgar raucous easy jokes for genuine wit and true insight and has an absolute ball while doing it a very nice low key feel good comedy
<START> unfortunately this movie never made it to dvd i saw it when it was first released to the theaters in 1983 and then again when the vhs was released in 1992 when i recently saw a vhs copy at a flea market i immediately bought it i was not disappointed first the obvious claudia ohana is beautiful and a joy to behold but then the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values and decide what is really important to you the movie is about a lot of things it is about how the world bank and large corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capitalist schemes to force them into a debt that they can never repay it is about how our economic system exploits us by forcing us into debt with credit cards mortgage and car payment it is about trying to save an innocence that maybe we have never really had and maybe we cannot really save it is about good and evil and about how hard it is sometimes to tell one from the other it raises a lot of questions but does not give answers i think sometimes this is good for this reason this is a film really worth saving and seeing
<START> this is one of my favorite govinda movies of all time and best film of 1994 david dhawan does a great job in directing this movie he makes it funny and adds family drama govinda is excellent as raja babu and gives a great performance karishma kapoor is an actress i hate this film she is a little less annoying but still annoys in some scenes kader khan is a maestro in acting and yet gives a superb performance aroona irani is terrific as the mother and gives a outstanding performance shakti kapoor is brilliant as nandu the sidekick this film has comedy action family drama and romance a full on entertainer
<START> this movie was more of a passage into manhood for one gay man and how he must deal with everyone his mother is depressed his younger sister is a pain his older sister is somewhat accepting the relationship looks good with his boyfriend exhooker and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy unfortunately the new guy screws around on him and says it really didn't mean anything our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and eventually leaves dumping his new lover and starting over we are left with him starting over and viewing not participating in happiness so maybe things will go better for him in the future the ending was kind of a downer but the whole movie was entirely realistic and so i will let this real ending slip bye with a high rating
<START> what a outstanding movie is this i have not words to describe i don't know how come the rating of the movie is 7 3 it should be 9 3 but anyways no one else can make this movie and the acting by akshay is just outstanding the second half of the movie makes u cry and the movie has a really good unexpected ending which makes the movie perfect you should watch this movie once i think twice well it's up to u anyways i love this movie and it's not just sad and funny but it also gives u a really good meanings and what u should be doing so i think this is one of the best movie in the bollywood history but i know the people has deferent chooses so ya the only thing i don't like about this movie is the music well the background music is good but the songs are not good enough i think the music would be better if a r rahman would be the music director but anyways we can't do anything about that so ya
<START> the last tarzan film starring johnny weissmuller looking surprisingly aged a year after tarzan and the huntress is bad in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better it is obvious that rko tried to make a great farewell for weissmuller shooting in beautiful scenery in mÃ©xico with a top star of that country andrea palma and multiple award winning cinematographer gabriel figueroa and bringing in prestigious composer dimitri tiomkin to do the score although it may have cost less for filming abroad it looks more expensive than any other rko film in the series taking advantage of acapulco beaches and real pyramids as aquatania and with impressive dÃ©cors for all the scenes related to the temple of god balu especially the exterior built on steep rocks kurt neumann should have stayed as director instead of robert florey who gives it a very slow pace neumann had done a fine work with tarzan and the amazons tarzan and the leopard woman and tarzan and the huntress and finished his career directing the classic the fly the year before his death while florey became a television director after a career of few remarkable films if weissmuller looks tired the chimp playing cheeta is not as good as the others but the worst character is benji an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs that have a caribbean air in a location supposed to be africa and shot in mÃ©xico boring and decidedly of dubious taste it was a sad farewell to weissmuller's tarzan
<START> this movie is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage ever it really is surprising that something so completely terrible could be made but if you can stand the mind numbing plot character development and direction you may get a kick out of the soundtrack which is so appalling that it is funny the movie begins terribly and quickly becomes unwatchable someone should give anyone involved with this movie some sort of consolation because their career was probably ruined because of involvement in this movie if you do end up seeing this movie or have seen it already i feel your pain then these words have come too late for anyone else stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste 2 hours of your life then at least you can clean up or something while viewing it
<START> i admit having come of age in the hippie dippy age i am a sucker for these kind of movies i can enjoy some of the schlock of the hippie genre far more than most normal people however this movie is simply awful in every conceivable way br br every trite perception of the hippie silliness is presented as gospel cops kill a young long hair when he peacefully lands a plane this movie is so horrible that it is not even funny to watch as a goof on the excesses of the hippie drone it is like a left wing version of dragnet except without professional actors the only reason i gave it two stars was because there are some obscurities of interest on the soundtrack besides i couldn't find a selection for negative stars br br no actors almost no plot sheeze barely even a script you got it an art movie all this done at root canal drilling slowness dragging out each meaningless scene just to fill up time br br in a bizarre twist of life imitating art the star nonactor of the movie joined a commune in real life and robbed a bank in boston one of his co robbers was killed and he was sent to jail where he was killed in a suspicious weightlifting accident and just think he got to leave this behind as a legacy oy vey
<START> hood of the living dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored lines are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing i find that 95 of amateur movies and 90 of home video footage is better than this film although the similarities between them warrant the comparison hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies hopefully nobody else wasn't my apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is somewhat harsh but i was the dope who read your fake reviews and purchased the movie
<START> lethargic direction ruins an otherwise compelling period story that stars the wondrous zhang ziyi in an excellent role as a woman who joins an extremist group in 1928 china just prior to the japanese invasion of manchuria and reunites with a former lover who is now working for japan every bit of drama and forward motion of the story is sucked dry by director ye lou's somnambulist directorial style characters stand still staring at each other for long minutes saying nothing hand held cameras hold forever on faces showing interminable reactions way longer than they need to edits repeat the same reaction is triple redundancy we know nothing about the characters as the story begins and are given little new information as the story progresses only silence and static shots of lovers who don't speak who interaction through silent dances but share no apparent emotional intimacy a very sleep inducing film
<START> the fallen ones falls under the waste of life wol category i am sad that i am now two hours older was not entertained my other family members also watched this movie and threw demeaning comments at the screen and rooted for the mummy i felt sorry for the actors wagner i have read other negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute slot on tv without any loss of plot it reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is bland with no flavor at all in my humble opinion the 42 foot mummy should have been 8 10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to denigh the facts and want dna samples for evil reasons the heroes are discredited and tossed on there ear by their colleges later after everything was screwed up by the evil people the heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong
<START> made me think about it for days after seeing it that to me is the mark of a great movie eyes wide shut had the same effect on me i am tired of these people requiring these happy hollywood cookie cutter endings i am planning on going to see it again tonight to understand the plot a little better but regardless the emotional messages of the movie were totally felt
