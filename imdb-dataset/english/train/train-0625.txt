<START> this is quite the gripping fascinating tragic story quite good and for the most part pretty accurate considering it is a tv movie rather than a documentary they did create some fictional characters and combine several actual people into one character but otherwise this is a good telling of a very tragic and dark story br br the final moments of the movie depicting the mass suicide murder are almost directly taken from an audio recording made by jim jones this recording was made during the final 44 minutes of the peoples temple's existence it is available in several places on the internet this portion of the film is almost spot on in that regard br br to sum up a documentary this is not however it does cover most of the base elements to the people's temple story
<START> this little film had long been on my keeper list do people realize how stressed out menopausal emotionally abused women as well as the mentally retarded were really treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century all of the pious uptight christian attitudes of that time were deadly to exploring true emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity can you really imagine by today's standards that walt whitman's books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional responses as great as a mans think about that the sensitivity of this movie still gets me and i give credit to the director for capturing this through his eyes
<START> the script for scary movie 2 just wasn't ready to go this is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident to the actors and the audience alike director keenan ivory wayans and many of the actors are funny people and so the movie isn't completely humorless to their credit the film has several funny moments but as a whole scary movie 2 is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original br br the first scary movie was a laugh a minute film it turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold the humor in scary movie 2 is as heavy handed as it is un original they even miss obvious opportunities for parody two of the movies stars are former cast members of beverly hills 90210 and this was a show that was begging to be parodied in the final analysis scary movie 2 is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon the script needed a lot more time to age 2 stars out of 5
<START> one of my best films ever maybe because i was well into the punk scene in the late 70s and went to many of hazels concerts but the film was a good story line and very good acting by hazel and a up and coming phil daniels not sure about his latest project eastenders excellent performance by lots of unknown actors who if you keep your eyes peeled will see them in many of the uk soaps today exp carver out of the bill the more i watch it the more of them i spot well if you have not seen it yet have a night in with the video don't forget to dig out the safety pin for your nose and heavy black eye makeup and shave your head mochanian style enjoy
<START> i watched this movie when i was a young lad full of raging hormones and it was about as sexy a movie as i had ever seen or ever was to see it may not have been a great movie my guess is it wasn't i don't really remember much about it to tell you the truth i only remember the sexual chemistry between crosby and biehn no woman in any movie has ever done it for me as the unbelievably sexy cathy did in this movie i haven't seen it since that first time i caught it on tv in the 70s and i don't think i'd want to see it again since i'm sure it would be a disappointment my hormones aren't as raging and i've become more jaded over the years still when i think back on the shower scene i can still remember how great it felt way back when br br added later after watching the movie again i discovered that it's dangerous to go home again what was once erotic is now pretty tame the older woman younger man thing still works for me just not as much as it once did probably because i'm no longer a 12 year old that older woman is now younger than i am also the amateurishness of the whole thing wasn't perceived by my twelve year old mind br br moral sometimes it's better not to revisit the past
<START> i totally disagreed with those comments which said this is a good movie this is a totally sucked movie i mean sucked s u c k e d the story development is strange mia kirshner changed from an innocent girl to a party fun seeking chick for no convincing reasons at all in addition all the actresses looked way too old for being college students college students looked like about 30 years old you figure out the rest i watched only about first ten minutes and started fast forwarding to look for sex scenes all the sex scenes are lame hasty and most importantly no frontal at all all the sex scenes are laughable considering how many clothes they had on do yourself a favor put it down and save yourself a few bucks conclusion story 0 sex 0 acting 0 score 0 out 10
<START> along with 2 days in the valley i think this is one of worst movies i've ever seen just another of the long line of tarantino rip offs that have emerged since pulp fiction the atmosphere the movie creates is amusing for the first five minutes but then the film makers make the unforgivable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to up the hip quotient you're better off skipping this one
<START> spoilers spoilers from its very opening credits this fantastic movie sets the record straight it's an instant classic it doesn't take long to realize that this movie is big bigger than kindergarten cop' or police academy 7 ' the sheer greatness of it left me speechless as i walked out of the movie theater and proceeded right back to the ticket counter to purchase myself another dozen of tickets br br this is a movie that simply requires multiple viewings the first watching will surely leave you with that strange huh ' feeling but don't feel embarrassed it happens to the best of us the story is so diabolically clever that one has to wonder about the mortality of its authors what seems to be a simple story of an idiot infiltrating the fbi turns out to be an allegorical story that works on several levels and teaches us all about the really important things in life the complexity of the plot structure will baffle you on your first viewing but don't give up not until my sixth or seventh viewing did i only begin to unravel some of the hidden mysteries of corky romano ' and watch out for the unexpected twist at the end otherwise you might be caught completely off guard when it is revealed that fbi agent brick davis is fbi's most wanted criminal corky is not a real fbi agent pops romano is innocent peter romano admits he's illiterate and paulie romano comes out of the closet as a homosexual surprised the hell out of me i can tell you that much br br chris kattan's comedic talents are unmatched as he leads his character corky romano through a maze of totally unpredictable situations reminiscent of john reynolds' performance in manos the hands of fate ' kattan takes on innumerable multiple personalities and tackles all scenes with perfect comedic timing however kattan is not just about comedy he is a master of drama as well as he controls the audience's feelings with the slightest moves of his face his facial expressions reflect life itself in a way for example in the scene in which he farts into his brothers' faces you can see the expression of social injustice and alienation clearly reflected on his anguished face at a moment like that it's hard to find a dry eye in the house br br screenwriters david garret and jason ward are the real heroes of corky romano ' with a story of such proportions it's easy to understand why two experienced writers had to be employed to complete this ambitious project their skillful storytelling and unorthodox structuring makes pulp fiction' look like a mediocre saturday night live skit garret and ward's story is so compelling and alluring that it grips you by your hair swallows you entirely shakes you around and spits you right out at the end of the out of this world experience known as corky romano' you find yourself a different person with different worldviews and different ideas and with only one question on your mind br br why god why
<START> i'll be honest the reason i rented this movie was because i am a huge fan of kyle chandler's most notably from early edition since he usually plays the good guy i wanted to see him as in a different role out of curiosity the plot itself also drew me in a wanna be hitman tony greco a k a mr chandler must kill a person at random before he is trusted with the life or rather the death of a witness who will testify against someone in the family the movies was nothing like i expected it was sick i hated the end if you saw it you'd know why and there were so many unnecessary parts basically it was filthy and made little sense yes it was a mob movie and yes the guns do go boom but there's more to a movie than that this film acted as if it didn't have the time to go into detail just deal with it and understand it the acting really made up for it james belushi was pretty amusing as the rose sheryl lee made angel seem as believable as she could get she surprised me the most and kyle chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to the family if only the script did justice to the actors
<START> i have seen this film only once on tv and it has not been repeated this is strange when you consider the rubbish that is repeated over and over again usually horror movies for me are a source of amusement but this one really scared me br br do not read the next bit if you have'nt seen the film yet br br the scariest bit is when the townsfolk pursue the preacher to where his wife lies almost dead they'd been poisoning her he asks who the hell are you people anyway one by one they give their true identities the girl who was pretending to be deaf in order to corrupt and seduce him says i am lilith the witch who loved adam before eve
<START> i can't say this is one of the best films i have ever seen but then again i can't say it's one of the worst i have ever seen br br ok so it's basically a girl does skating is good at it wants to go to an expensive school can't afford it and has to take a hockey scholarship she has to hide her skating secret from her friends br br personally i didn't like the actress playing katelin she absolutely couldn't cry to save her life just made wailing sounds like a toddler pretending to cry to get it's own way br br katelin was just an annoying person the way she tried to act all nice and helpful to people also the part where the two skaters are calling her names and they say something about her choreographer and she says she 'draws the line' made me cringe br br we all knew where it was going to go with her and spencer classically they didn't like each other and sort of get together at the end was just typical br br overall i think this is a movie to watch if you like skating but if you don't mind the main skater being extremely annoying it's good to kill time basically
<START> this movie isn't terrible really somebody commented that mo is the type of american europeans snicker at but there are those and not necessarily anglo saxon yahoos who do not care for frenchmen and the xavier character isn't going to sway them br br let's consider his stereotypical frenchman attributes br br 1 cynical very cynical check br br 2 reedy underfed appearance check despite br br 3 a great appreciation of cuisine check br br 4 lukewarm work ethic check forget the fact he is supposedly a rich stockbroker from watching him in the film he seems to put in ten hour workweeks br br 5 beautiful wife check despite that br br 6 loose interpretation of the marriage vows check br br 7 big sexual ego which says an american girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner check br br whether mo is a hick or not there's no reason for her to fall for this smug european twit other than the script dictates so br br on the other hand as other male reviewers have i did enjoy seeing karen allen's cute petite body i'll give the movie four stars two of them are for that
<START> it must be the most corniest tv show on the air this is probably a escape for jim belushi and all of his bad movies his brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother i hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use jim has got to retire or something please let them go of the air if i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing i still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running we all know deep down that we want to shoot our tv screens when we see jim's face in conclusion no more please
<START> mann photographs the alberta rocky mountains in a superb fashion and jimmy stewart and walter brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do br br but come on hollywood a mountie telling the people of dawson city yukon to elect themselves a marshal yes a marshal and to enforce the law themselves then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town br br nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the canadian side of the border during the klondike gold rush mr mann and company appear to have mistaken dawson city for deadwood the canadian north for the american wild west br br canadian viewers be prepared for a reefer madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot or to shake your head in disgust
<START> i like musicals but as a dickens fan i hate this one mild spoilers starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse the poor of london coming out to sing fagin and dodger walking off into the sunset not exactly faithful to the novel as i recall dodger was publicly hanged and fagin went crazy in prison end of spoilers br br oliver reed is very weak as sykes doing little more than growling to indicate his evil worst however is mark lester as oliver who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he's really the main character his portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl guess they didn't realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in england br br self respecting dickens fans stick to david lean's amazing 1948 film or the bbc 6 hour adaptation from the mid 80's avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical
<START> this is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in northern england filmed on location in bolton it stars james mason as the father who is the dominant force within his home or so it seems cleverly the film based on the play portrays the complexities of family life the supporting cast is terrific as well with many familiar faces lending support
<START> this movie seems to start in the middle introduces peripheral players as if they were significant and presents main characters without any substance and paper thin and or impenetrable back stories almost nobody has a credible or discernible motivation for their actions in this film the plot rambles and ultimately goes nowhere the dialogue is clunky and trite and the director has little concept of how to get the best from his actors it almost feels like there's a first half of this movie but it never got made br br we're told that a mysterious pyramid has appeared over new york city and that central park has inexplicably become an arctic wasteland yet none of this seems to have caused much of a stir amongst the general population and is only of minimal concern to the government br br we're presented with the evil corporation in eugenics but that's really just a convenient conceit to populate the universe with a couple power tripping minions the whole eugenics is bad double entendre is heavy handed and never really pans out here we're supposed to care about the central characters but we never learn enough about them to know why so much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped that it comes off as a 1 hour 40 minute fatalistic rationalization for rape br br on the ground breaking digitally animated world created here all i can say is that at about the same time as this film was made several other directors did the same thing with more seamless and believable results br br after spending the time to watch this film the most burning question left in my mind was so what
<START> what i loved about the on screen adaptation of the stone angel is that it stayed so true to the novel great film as an avid reader i find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation you can tell the stone angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film br br ellen burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar however i think the canadian actress christine horne chosen to play hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise i haven't seen any of horne's previous work but i will definitely seek it out after seeing her stone angel performance br br i heard the canadian theatrical release of the stone angel is going to happen in spring or summer 2008 i can't wait to see it on the big screen again
<START> this is one of my favourite martial arts movies from hong kong it is one of john woo's earliest films and one of only a few traditional martial arts movies he directed you can see his influences from working under chang cheh in this film the action is good the fight choreography is conducted by fong hak on who appears as one of the bad guys in the movie it stars wei pei of five venoms fame and a whole host of faces familiar to fans of golden harvest and shaw brothers productions the story line is interesting there are a few decent plot twists and the build up of the characters and their relationships with each other is cleverly done this film has only had a vhs release in the uk media asia have released a region 3 dvd and there are versions of it on dvd available from the usa the film is lovely to watch in either it's original language or in it's english dubbed version i highly recommend this movie
<START> this movie awed me so much that i watch it at least once a year at times i find it uncomfortable at times i find it empowering and i always find the characters human and real it is a movie that shows you the gritty reality of life in la starting with the recurring helicopter search lights scanning for the dangers lurking so close to the ordinary lives being carried on by the characters it is also a movie that shows you how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and empower you to make a difference grand canyon reminds you that every action you take whether intended or not has powerful repercussions i found this movie to be similar in many ways to robert altman's film short cuts both had a star studded roster of perfectly cast actors actresses and both movies allowed you to gradually see how the the characters interrelated with one another and affected each other for better or worse grand canyon did a better job of providing a cohesive message hope in the face of despairing reality than altman's film although i found them both intriguing in their own way this film is a definite must see
