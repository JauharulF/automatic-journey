<START> this movie offers nothing to anyone it doesn't succeed on any level the acting is horrible dull long winded dribble they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for complete garbage i can't believe what a laughable movie this was br br and i'm very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit a wowing nc 17 movie the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the oc or something aimed at teens pathetic
<START> extremities is the disturbing yet riveting screen version of a play by william mastriosimone who adapted his own play for the screen about a woman who is attacked in her car one night by a would be rapist on her way home and is terrified when she realizes the man got her purse and knows where she lives after her roommates leave for work the next day the guy shows up at her home and attempts to rape her the story takes a surprising twist when at one point the woman turns the tables on the man and is able to overpower him but when she realizes there is no way that attempted rape can be proved and if the man is arrested he will just get off she decides to keep him prisoner in the house until she can get a confession out of him far fetched maybe disturbing definitely but there's a wonderfully claustrophobic feel about this film especially the middle with just the woman and her attacker that you can't help but feel completely a part of what's going on i did not see the play on broadway but i would imagine a piece like this works better onstage but that doesn't make this film any less riveting an experience farrah fawcett one of the last actresses to do the role on broadway was awarded the role of marjorie in the film version and delivers a taut and deeply moving performance as the victim who refuses to be a victim many critics found fawcett's performance to be one note but for me marjorie is a woman completely numbed by what she has been through and the performance works for me james russo in the performance of his career is slimy and menacing as the would be rapist who finds marjorie to be much more of a challenge than he assumed alfre woodard and diana scarwid co star as marjorie's roommates who come home after marjorie has overpowered the guy and has him tied up and stuffed in their fireplace upon their arrival and it's the arrival of the roommates that take the story to an unexpected level because they didn't see what we saw marjorie go through and therefore think she should call the police and let them handle the guy not for the faint of heart but if you can stand it a gripping film experience anchored by a lead performance that will surprise you
<START> i got this movie from netflix after a long waiting time so i was anticipating it greatly when it arrived my worst fears were that it would be plodding as well as well you know what all the screaming fan girls were babbling about gacktnhyde hawt yaoi love that sort of thing dreading it i was very very pleasantly surprised the movie was surprisingly watchable even if the filming and music did make it feel like someone was going to bust out a pair of nun chucks every two scenes and the acting on gackt's part was quite good hyde being um hyde acted as a quasi romantic friend gang member character that anyone who saw him on stage would hardly be surprised by he's one of my two major beefs with the film itself but the rest of the cast including the child actors in the opening scene were very good at doing what they did which was mostly get shot at and yelled at but my second problem was very minor having to do with the goriness it seemed way too suspense horror to me like every scene where someone is shot they either slump over really most sincerely dead or lay there burbling for a rather long time but sho just takes the shots repeatedly keels over bubbles a lot while he talks and makes hyde cry all in all if you're a fan of any of the actors or just a j film fan it's definitely worth a watch
<START> this is an entertaining history of the fbi but it should be viewed as fiction because that's exactly what it is what else could it be when j edgar hoover personally approved and had a cameo role in the production james stewart is excellent as usual and the supporting cast except for the talentless vera miles is good murray hamilton is especially good in a supporting role as stewart's partner and best friend the fbi accomplishments that the film highlights are undoubtedly all true what is significant is what it leaves out br br one of the most shameful parts of the film is the depiction of the killing of john dillinger it is portrayed pretty much as it happened but no mention at all is made of melvin purvis the chicago bureau chief who headed the operation instead the operation is depicted as if the fictional chip hardesty were running it it has been said that hoover was jealous of the publicity that purvis received after dillinger was killed purvis was subsequently transferred to a remote outpost and shortly afterward left the fbi this is no doubt why purvis was never mentioned in the film but this viewer at least paused to think that if purvis was treated this way what about all the agents who conducted all the other operations depicted in the film were they also completely ignored and replaced by the fictional hardesty br br the film is probably accurate in its portrayal of fbi activity up through the end of wwii however after that point the film would have us believe that the only threat facing the us came from international communism which is no doubt what hoover believed never mind the mafia never mind the lynchings that were still going on in the south never mind that blacks were being intimidated to keep them from voting in much of the south i don't know if the fbi had started wiretapping martin luther king by the time this film was made but if not it wasn't very long afterward that it started br br as i said at the outset this is pretty good entertainment but it should be viewed as the sanitized fictionalization that it is
<START> many of the reviewers have made it a point to note that pinjar is unlike the run of the mill films produced in bollywood while this is true bollywood films in general are geared to a specific audience and should be appreciated for accomplishing their aims in this regard br br however pinjar is an excellent film for those seeking a change from the normal equation based bollywood film set during the time of partition between india and pakistan pinjar focuses on a punjabi girl who becomes the victim of societal and cultural attitudes toward the treatment of women in her time paro the protagonist is forced to choose between a life with a man who has abducted her and the fleeting hope of a life with her family back in indian ruled punjab more than an issue of hindus and muslims pinjar addresses and defines a woman's role as a daughter as a wife and as a mother in india and pakistan in 1947 unlike typical bollywood films which are escapist in nature pinjar is a film that makes its audience contemplate these issues during and after the film
<START> rumor has it that when the nasa technical advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable they laughed for several hours after all unless you are a politician or work crew the shuttle you are not going to get in the shuttle furthermore space cadet camp is in alabama not florida br br the truth is everyone on earth will win multi billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible this film was meant for kids and had to have been written by one because they are not aware of the myriad restrictions and requirements regarding access to ksc ccafs br br this is the most useless film of all time and it was a well deserved flop
<START> every second of the film is gorgeous and that's why it earns a 7 because the plot is not especially devious and thinking back over the last 90 minutes i never really felt any excitement or investment in the characters if anything the luxurious graphics and framing have made certain scenes the car chase for instance more pedestrian than they ought to be not that they don't look lovely and have some very original design and occasionally novel camera angles but they are missing the kinetic movement and close up shots that are part of the language for any normal action thriller the first hour plods along and the dialogue feels very edited and a bit stagey people wait for each other to finish and don't always react in a natural cadence which would be a problem of recording each individual's dialogue separately on rare occasions the emotions in the voices don't quite match those on screen something that should really have been avoided the futuristic architecture is very attractive lots of glass walls ceilings screens lovely smoke mirage special effects and nice looking cars but again it's more an exercise in graphic design having no real impact on the story i'd argue that the whole point of using drawn animation instead of actors cgi is to really push the limits of imagination and design to do that which is too difficult impractical in other mediums although the animation in renaissance is certainly stunning and incredibly well accomplished i never felt like i was seeing something that hasn't been done before br br immortel another french cgi film also suffers from an imbalance of beauty over story pace to be fair some marvellous and engaging french movies also have a languid pace and lingering shots of the look in someone's eyes or the rain on paris cobbles can evoke great emotion but animators need to understand that while animation brings unique strengths it also has weaknesses when compared to real life technique perhaps it would break from the 'noir' rules that the film wants to stick to but i think the film makers also missed a glaring opportunity to explore their future society a bit more the social strata the fascistic grip of the corporations etc br br i have no problem recommending renaissance to anybody who enjoys stylistic design and or animation 'manga' fans in particular but i wouldn't make my other film loving friends sit through it take away the sumptuous visuals and it's a barely average film
<START> if this movie were more about piper perabo's character and less about the bar this might have been halfway decent piper's violet stanford and karen friendly adventures of rocky and bullwinkle both have a virgin kindegarden teacher quality to them that's endearing here's hoping she'll find a better movie to be in
<START> i believe i received this film when i was a young buck i remembered watching it as a child but i could never find the film i remembered good ol rageddy ann andy babette the greedy king koo koo i searched high and low for this movie and still no luck but one day when i was moving out of my childhood home i had found it we were reunited i am 17 years old now i still watch it all the time actually it's one of the funniest and touching movies i have ever seen and enjoyed at the same time and personally i think they should make a sequel mmm yes a sequel indeed now i am even considering getting the captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body
<START> maria braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility she will do everything to make her marriage work including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation and thus beneath the vicey exterior she reveals a rather sweet value system the film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with 'and then i woke up' it is also book ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence i've ever seen but don't let any of that put you off
<START> larry burrows has the distinct feeling he's missing out on something ever since he missed a crucial baseball shot at school that cost the championship he's been convinced his life would have turned out better had he made that shot then one night his car breaks down again walking into the nearest bar to wait for the tow truck larry happens upon barman mike who unbeknown to larry is about to change his life for ever br br the alternate life premise in cinema is hardly a new thing stretching back to the likes of it's a wonderful life and showing no signs of abating with the quite recent sandler vehicle that was click it's a genre that has produced very mixed results back in 1990 was this james belushi led production rarely mentioned when the said topic arises it appears that it has largely been forgotten which is a shame since it oozes charm and is not short in the humour department we know that we are being led to its ultimate message come the end but it's a fun and enjoyable path to be led down the film also serves notice to what a fine comedy actor james belushi was i mean if his style of smart quipping and larking exasperation isn't your thing then chances are you would avoid this film anyway but for those engaged by the likes of red heat k 9 and taking care of business well mr destiny is right up your street along for the ride are linda hamilton michael caine jon lovitz hart bochner jay o sanders rene russo and courteney cox br br mr destiny pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message at its heart 7 10
<START> rich alcoholic robert stack falls in love with secretary lauren bacall he marries her and is so happy he stops drinking however bacall is secretly loved by stacks' best friend rock hudson and stacks' nymphomaniac sister dorothy malone lusts after rock throw in a few complications and the movie goes spinning out of control in a good way br br very glossy movie in beautiful technicolor with jaw dropping fashions and furnishings check out bacall's hotel room at the beginning everybody looks perfect and dresses in beautiful form fitting clothes basically this is a soap opera with grade a production values the story itself is lots of fun and some of the dialogue at the beginning is hilariously over the top the acting by hudson stack and bacall isn't that good but seeing them so young and glamorous is great especially stack when he smiled my knees went weak dorothy malone on the other hand is fantastic she deservedly won best supporting actress for her role she's sexy violent vicious and sympathetic all convincingly br br fun glossy trash don't miss it
<START> while the kiss of the spider woman cast raul julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified latin american country this time he works for a dictator in a fictional latin american country specifically the dictator suddenly drops dead so julia replaces el presidente with a broadway actor richard dreyfuss shooting a movie in the country from there dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator all the while balancing it with his own life br br is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in latin america into comedy well moon over parador does a good job with it no matter what they do in this movie they pull it off it just goes to show why richard dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our era and what we lost when raul julia died definitely worth seeing also starring sonia braga who co starred with raul julia in tkotsw jonathan winters and sammy davis jr br br i agree the first lady is hot
<START> perhaps i would have liked this film more if i wasn't so attached to the characters in henry fool to those who've never seen henry fool i wouldn't worry as hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at tiff the film has lots of exposition and explanations br br this film is very heavy in plot which keeps the film moving there are many humorous moments and the film certainly has hartley's trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue over all a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of hartley who are just beginning explore his work as for the older fans who loved his earlier works like trust and amateur this film could go either way i have mixed feelings about the film and hartley's later films in general what hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other since his late 90s and onward his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter mass media in no such thing religion in the book of life and now terrorism in fay grim i don't know if hartley's talents are suited to such big subject matter or if he's able to do it justice br br strangely enough the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves the only problem is i've seen henry fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film you can tell this film was written long after henry fool was finished without any intention of a sequel somehow the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of henry's books of confessions as a macguffin in the hitchcockian sense fay's motivations for finding henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in henry fool br br i guess i'm slightly disappointed in the film because it's not true to the characters in the henry fool and it doesn't exactly work as a straight ahead thriller there's too much irony and wryness in hartley's approach to such as big topic as terrorism it somehow works and doesn't work at the same time all i could say you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on hartley's work and how well you know hartley's work fans of henry fool be severely warned for a disappointment for the rest welcome to the world of hal hartley and enjoy the ride
<START> with all of the films of recent dealing with the british monarchy is it really time for another answer you bet the young victoria is another contribution to the wave of cinema from britain dealing with the royal family in this case it deals with the early life of princess victoria and events leading up to the coronation of her becoming queen of all england as well as her romance eventual wedding to prince albert the film also deals with the tempestuous lives careers of both england's queen prince as well as several other events that transpire political turmoil etc emily blunt plays a radiant victoria in her youth while rupert friend is her beloved best friend prince albert the rest of the cast is rounded out with the likes of miranda richardson as the dutchess of kent and the always welcome on screen jim broadbent as king william as well as a cast of others that shine on screen jean marc vallee c r a z y loser love directs from a winning screenplay by jullian fellowes vanity fair gosford park separate lies i absolutely went out of my head over the film's visual look by cinematographer hagen bogdansker who gave each frame of film a painterly look with the help of production designer patrice vermette as well as some tight editing by jill bilcock matt garner what i also appreciated in fellowes' script is the use of a game of chess as a metaphor for some of the film's political motivation the characters in the film move about like the pieces on a chess board this is smart well written directed filmed edited acted entertainment and enlightenment that makes for a well spent evening at the cinema rated pg by the mpaa for a few scenes of sensuality some brief violence a little bloody although nothing too gory a rude outburst of language and some on screen smoking
<START> this is a excellent series you will laugh you will cry these wonderful people will be a part of your family the way this family cares for one another and helps each other through their crisis sets a great example of the way we should live our lives there are many good things they do and a number of bad choices but they never turn their backs on family they work through problems michelle the youngest daughter is the cutest thing i've seen stephanie the middle daughter suffers with middle child syndrome and with the help of everyone in the family it's better dj the oldest daughter is growing up whether her dad wants it to happen or not one thing they all share is they miss their mom danny dad joey and uncle jesse love these kids so much and it's apparent in every episode
<START> the only thing that frequently pops into my head while i'm writing this review is i'll never get that hour and a half back to indicate that i'm not just blowing air i'll compare the movie to the other movies of the cube trilogy cube and hypercube cube wasn't great but it was original and that made up for some technical flaws hypercube as a sequel lost the advantage of originality but it came out looking pretty sharp and i even liked it beter than cube the story was better but cube zero in comparison to it's predecessors really isn't worth sh t a complete lack of good fx a very f ck d up script and just plain old bad acting don't combine well example all of the time during the movie i was thinking it would be incredibly stupid if should happen and then it would happen so it's not very original neither my advice don't lose that hour and a half i lost oh and i hope this movie crashes and burns
<START> this is a depressingly shallow naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly improbable relationship between brooks' psychotic film editor and harold his vapid girlfriend the two have zero chemistry together primarily because harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking pretty at this stage of her career but also because brooks' character is neither interesting nor likeable there are 15 static excruciating minutes at the beginning where brooks having just broke up with harold stumbles about his apartment in a depressed drugged out state unbearable br br sappily and unimaginatively bookended by joe cocker's you are so beautiful there simply is not enough material here for a feature film there is hardly anything going on on the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world i'm sure brooks' intention was to shine a white hot spotlight on the affair and in a way deconstruct it but if you're going to do that the writing and acting needs to be far far better than what it is here
<START> as much as i have enjoyed the hanzo the razor movies three is definitely enough 'who's got the gold ' the final adventure for the japanese lawman with the impressive package is a fairly enjoyable piece of pinku cinema but offers little new in terms of ideas whilst taking a big step backwards as far as outrageousness is concerned br br the film opens with the appearance of a female ghost and looks as though it is going to explore supernatural territory something which might have taken the series in an interesting new direction unfortunately after the spook turns out to be nothing but a scooby doo style ruse cooked up by a corrupt treasury official keen to keep people away from the lake where he is hiding stolen gold director yoshio inoue is content to recycle familiar elements from the first two films the result being a rather stale affair br br once again hanzo heads an investigation that requires him to interrogate women through the use of his mighty penis slice up his enemies and abuse his superiors on the way we get wild orgies good natured rape hanzo forces himself on women who wind up appreciating his willfulness and bloody sword fights br br if you've already seen and appreciated the first two films you might as well watch this instalment to complete the set but be warned this is probably the least satisfying one of them all br br 6 5 out of 10 rounded up to 7 for imdb
<START> a damsel in distress is a delight because of the great gershwin songs fred astaire joan fontaine and a terrific supporting cast headed by gracie allen and george burns br br typically silly plot for an astaire film has him as an american dance star in england with burns as his publicist and allen his secretary they concoct a story about his being a love bug with women falling victim to him left and right he runs into fontaine who is being held captive in her castle by a domineering aunt and docile father silly plot br br the great songs include a foggy day things are looking up nice work if you can get it and i can't be bothered now fontaine does not sing but does a brief and decent number with astaire surprisingly good in a few dance numbers with astaire are burns and allen including an inventive and fun romp through an amusement park br br also in the cast are reginald gardiner constance collier montagu love harry watson as albert ray noble and my favorite jan duggan as the lead madrigal singer br br jan duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio who sings nice work if you can get it her facial expressions are hilarious she was also a scene stealer in the w c fields comedy the old fashioned way playing cleopatra pepperday br br much abuse has been heaped on this film because of the absence of ginger rogers who as noted elsewhere would have been hideously miscast the tcm host notes that ruby keeler and jessie matthews were considered yikes two more would be disasters fontaine is fine as alyce and the dynamic allows the musical numbers to belong to astaire with ample comic relief by burns and allen br br fun film great songs good cast and jan duggan in a rare spotlight
