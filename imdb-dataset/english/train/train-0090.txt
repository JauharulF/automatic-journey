<START> this movie might not put the catholic church in the best light but it is telling a story based on true events unfortunately not everything in life including religion are all nice and rosy sometimes people and groups do things that at the time seem like the right thing but in retrospective do not look as great as they once did a love divided tells the story of a family yes it does incorporate religion but really the story is about a family and that family's ability to stay together no matter what is thrown at them this film is also based on true events which is not to say that this story scene by scene is true but if you were to look at news articles from that time period you would be able to see that neither churches handled the incident in a way that was helpful towards the family both churches are at fault here the catholic church for forcing such a regulation on the family in the first place and not responding to the violence that came with it and the protestant church for telling the mother that she should just obey her husband and his priest and not put up a fight in this case both let this family down i believe that the film does a good job in showing this struggle in both the church and the family it in no way shape or form is putting down the catholic church just the opposite it shows how one incident can change the course of that religion's ideas and how one person can have an effect far more reaching then just themselves
<START> this is even worse than the original game of death a jumbled incoherent storyline leads to billy lo falling from a helicopter to the ground below killing him as we're left to follow his younger brother bobby lo so not only do we start out following some bruce lee clone the film kills that one off and has us follow another one thirty minutes into the story the main reason to watch this one is when bobby lo fights a lion which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume jang lee hwang is also the villain who is usually pretty awesome but his screen time is significantly small mainly watched this and the original game of death because they're a part of the bruce lee boxed set it's no wonder they're included with lee's finished works no one would buy them otherwise
<START> the plot for descent if it actually can be called a plot has two noteworthy events one near the beginning one at the end together these events make up maybe 5 of the total movie time everything and i mean everything in between is basically the director's desperate effort to fill in the minutes i like disturbing movies i like dark movies and i don't get troubled by gritty scenes but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy dark literally scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming rosario dawson one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here and no she doesn't get naked not even in the nc 17 version which i saw br br if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch descent take a nap instead you'll probably have more interesting dreams
<START> it is first and foremost a chick flick it is a romantic comedy there is a fair balance between the two this particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet fight scenes i don't think any wires were used or if they were they weren't flat out blatant it isn't a terribly complicated movie so it easy on the brain no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning pretty simple good chemistry between the leads and a fun watch i'd like it if they made brought out the full potential of the girls looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of pretty i'd watch it again with a girl
<START> four years after making his directorial debut with the art house snoozer welcome to l a alan rudolph shows us what he really wanted from hollywood was to be one of the guys roadie is a frat boy fracas complete with barroom brawls horny harpies art carney in a souped up wheelchair and meat loaf at the wheel meat loaf playing travis w redfish is actually a rather charming presence on the screen and perhaps in a smaller role in a better movie he might indeed be ingratiating but zalman king's script is full of stereotypical redneck humor and helpless meat loaf is kept wide eyed and moronic alice cooper roy orbison hank williams jr and blondie all make appearances and all look embarrassed they certainly should roadie is one bad trip no stars from
<START> i just got puzzled why damn fox canceled the season3 although season2 was not as good as season1 which is excellent indeed i like it so much that i even thinking about buying dvd on amazon failed i am a chinese student and it's inconvenient for me to get a international credit card and i just hope fox can bring back da someday somehow
<START> despite reading the initial comments from someone who curiously disliked the film why is the only negative comment very first on the list it was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it obviously the church wanted to stress certain points and portray the prophet joseph smith in a positive manner thats the whole idea and in fact those points were extremely effective we already know joseph smith was human but despite that and all of the horrific negative attempts stirred on by the adversary it showed just how he was able to complete a remarkable god given work i'd recommend it to anyone
<START> the book is so good that at least the opening of this made for tv movie will move you but then as it diverges more and more from the book taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches it becomes boring still from comments i've heard people who have not read the book tend to like it and if it leads even on child to read a wrinkle in time it will have served its purpose the most embarrassing change is to make the happy medium a clone of mary poppins' uncle albert i love to laugh nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny
<START> blackadder 3 is probably the blackadder series that people have least heard of it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it but it is still great a fiery duke of wellington and a fat foolish dr johnson writer of the first dictionary in england make this series one to be reckoned with there are still more hilarious one liners to be delivered in this series and it brings out the humour in a lesser known era in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well known of the lot but rowan atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one and hugh laurie is at his best in this series very good 9 10
<START> return of the jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series and is a fine conclusion to the star wars saga with han solo imprisoned by jabba the hut and the empire building a new death star the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side and only our favourite heroes can pull it off br br the opening sequence set on tatooine we see jabba's palace a pit of slavery and scum and new home to han solo as luke and the gang prepare for his rescue and with luke's jedi powers they have the edge br br we also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end han leia and chewy battle it out on endor desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the death star the rebel fleet led by lando battle with the imperial fleet while they wait for the shields to go down and luke has a final showdown with darth vader an epic end to a classic saga and it's only just of the pace of the first two br br 10 10
<START> when seeing this movie you should take notice to that itÂ´s not a normal movie it has no real story just characters a bunch of gangster characters who come together in a perfect harmony the dialogue is wonderful you can just lay back and listen the movie stands out thats why itÂ´s hard to find a right way of describing it br br thats why the user comments on this movie is so mixed br br i for one love the movie and recommend it to all who love one liners and things that differ from the normal you canÂ´t really put the finger on whatÂ´s so wonderful about it itÂ´s just a comical world where gangsters rule a place of love and danger a movie that you can see more than one time
<START> this series produced at probably the most propitious time following the events of the second world war is on a scale of value that stands far above any individual's presumption to criticize br br the timing of world at war's production in 1974 amounting to some three decades after the events of the war permits an accurate relating of events in a manner uncoloured by residual propaganda and slant the passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the very individuals involved ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers civilians and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable most approaching or well into their senior years the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor may have affected them in the past to have receded away leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did br br the information that these survivors give strikingly reinforced by the postures and expressions they display while telling their part give their stories all the more impact such names as ira eaker adolph galland louis mountbatten albert speer gertrude junge hitler's personal secretary the list is far too long to relate br br today within the lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the hideous price of political ambition are young people who chant the same sort of militaristic and nationalistic war promotion as led to ww2 the dvd series we discuss here ought to comprise the core of a mandatory history subject in schools that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken to heart by those who did not see firsthand the terrible price br br i am almost done watching the 11 disk set having seen most of the series when a local tv channel aired it more than 10 years ago it has lost none of its poignancy to me indeed has become even more of a magnificent chronicle of some of the very darkest days of human times br br the highest possible rating seems unworthy of being applied to this presentation i think the value of this series is beyond counting
<START> now this is what a family movie should be there are few films of recent years that have been targeted at families or children that really are worthy of their viewing public but this is one of them my whole family came away from the film awed entertained dazzled and happy we're still quoting little anecdotes from it here and there the children loved it and so did we hubbie and i are 36 and 32 respectively br br apart from its beautiful and striking animation the characters small as they may be and imaginary as they are are very well developed there isn't one of them that you cannot empathize with the personalities bringing these little creatures to life are well casted voice talents combined with the skill and artistry of some of disney's best animators this is a film worthy of walt disney himself i think mr disney would heartily approve of this new film flick dot and their fellow band of tiny heroes may become as popular as mickey and minnie in our time br br this is one the family leaves the theatre wanting to see again and buy to own on video or dvd i'm eager to see it again to pick up what i might have missed the first time never have i seen my children so quickly and vividly identify with and embrace characters before my daughter is still talking about little dot br br this film is funny heartwarming clever and great fun for the whole family
<START> this film tried to be too many things all at once stinging political satire hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family values promo the list goes on and on it failed miserably at all of them but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end br br although i appreciate the spirit behind war inc it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique rather than simply the poor writing direction and production of this particular film br br there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening reminds me a bit of three kings which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern
<START> it's so sad that romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows as superficial and brutal as the garcea series or the vacanta mare child plays the difference is that mugur mihÃ¤escu doru octavian dumitru and other such sub artisans never presume to claim their shows as art pintilie who 40 years ago made a very good movie duminicÃ¤ la ora sase followed by another one nice enough reconstituirea tries to declare his film lenghts art works but unfortunately he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression as such niki ardelean offers again a sample of how not this being about its only merit
<START> blank check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties the plot is completely pointless its overtones of lonliness are pathetic do you really believe a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this film like buying a mansion for a mere 300 grand the notion let alone the bargain basement price will only be believed by the most gullible viewers please respect your intelligence and don't watch this awful awful film
<START> a solid if unremarkable film matthau as einstein was wonderful my favorite part and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton i loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for robbins to retrieve the birdie
<START> the opening scene of this film sets the pace for the entirety of its ninety minutes the shots are generic conventional and of television movie quality the snow drenched scenery is gorgeous yet the characters held with in it have a similar quality to that of looking at a photograph of such scenery the overwhelming feeling being that of distance some of the editing is fairly high quality and the work of an veteran professional the dialogue however is clunky and artificial having little bearing on 'real' conversations at all seemingly any emotional insight is displaced in favour of swearing which is of course the way in which everyone shows their true feelings the action is slow and underwhelming the overall feeling being one of someone trickling cold water over your head but so slowly that you barely notice yet eventually you feel pathetic and slightly sorry for yourself for being caught in such a incomprehensible situation br br the mixture of genres that the fessenden has seemingly tried to use psychological thriller horror and family drama although commendable suffers from a serious lack of tension and interesting dialogue the way in which the husband wife and child trio interact is particularly unrealistic the themes of family relationships being played out in haunting setting have been covered countless times before by far superior films an instant example being that of the shining 1980 the family unit here are torn by innocuous troubles which are hard to understand or sympathise with considering the relative ambiguity of the script br br the family unit is hardly stalked throughout the film fessenden playing down the thriller possibilities of the narrative in favour of a slow family drama for the majority of the running time the 'stalker' figure otis has few apparent motives for his behaviour and despite being perhaps the most interesting and well acted character is still very underdeveloped the main characters are empty husks of people who it was extremely hard to relate to their relationships with each other being particularly void of any sentiment or feeling although the ignorance of the erik per sullivan's young character by his parents is presumably part of the story surely any reasonable person would question their son if he allegedly spoke to someone who seemingly doesn't exist people can accept this film as intelligent because of its relative lack of conventional aspects regarding creature based horror movies but this film fails in respect of whichever genre you wished to pigeonhole it in you can read deep psychological meanings into every single minute detail of anything if you should so wish to but i think people would be better off over analysing their carpet for some deep emotional meaning rather than these vacuous sub human creations
<START> after harry reems' teenage girlfriend is raped by zebbedy colt the night walker reems becomes despondent and consoles himself by having sex with some lesbians meanwhile colt who carries a cane and dresses like a magician rapes some more women eventually reems decides to track him down and end his crime spree despite being shot on film and marginally nasty it looks like any other 70's porno and is ineptly executed the rape abuse scenes are surprisingly restrained and the attempt to cash in on death wish is laughable r bolla cannibal holocaust plays a cop colt who is usually over the top wigs out in a couple of scenes but he's too well behaved for my money this roughie could have been much rougher
<START> although the beginning of the movie in new york takes too long the movie is a must see for people who like this genre when hannah goes to berlin to visit the older woman who helped her mother during the war the movie gets much much better the movie is a bit like the pianist can not really be compared
