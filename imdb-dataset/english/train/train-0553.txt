<START> this is just a joke of a movie they lost me already at the opening scene spoilerwarning dangerous creature kills other creature in his cage this is watched by a scientist that works there on a monitor and guess what she does well lets go in to the cage to check the stuff out omg how dumb do those writers think human beings are come on thats the same like jumping in a fish tank with a great white shark because it ate your goldfish pretty useless and even more dumber and i will not even talk about the cast because they aren't worth the effort why they didn't fired the guy that wrote that immediately is a mystery to me and this kinda dumbness continues the entire movie only good thing where the cgi that is better then average for these kinda low budget movies br br if these kinda things don't bother you go see it but be warned if your iq is above 60 you will probably hate it
<START> aka demons iii br br made for italian tv although shot in english and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier demons films it was supposed to be simply titled the ogre which is how director lamberto bava had released it br br an american family rents an italian villa for the summer the woman virginia bryant has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon like structure hanging down from the ceiling it glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it it drips what looks like green paint br br of course the husband doesn't believe any of this the villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it br br but then the ogre itself appears in what looks like some kind of 16th centaury costume with what looks like a wolf's head attached to it and it's attracted to the scent of orchids br br the films isn't really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring there's no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool the ogre itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family's jeep cherokee br br the copy of the shriek dvd i watched was defective with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film a flaw i hope shriek has since corrected extras include a short interview with lamberto bava where he explains how this wasn't a sequel etc etc along with some trailers to other shriek dvd releases this is pretty standard stuff br br 3 out of 10 br br
<START> phantom of the mall is a film that fits best in the easily forgotten category it's a pretty lousy variant on the famous story by gaston leroux the phantom of the opera not a bad idea to itself but the plot and production of this movie are way to weak to bring a decent homage to that story on the bright side gaston leroux doesn't has to turn over in his grave just yet it could have been a lot worse br br phantom of the mall has too many useless flashbacks in it and way too many boring sequences to make it memorable also the scriptwriters wanted to give too much draught to the story than necessary and even though there's a lot of mystery getting build up about the character of eric the basic plot is ordinary and dÃ©jÃ  vu spoilers it's about a young couple that brutally gets torn apart because the boy gets killed in a fire that fire was set to his house because he and his parents refused to sell their home in order to make room for a huge mall to be build the boy survived the fire and he has hidden himself in the mall to avenge himself meanwhile he guards his girl who now works in the mall and tries to forget her loss end spoilers this pretty simple but rather effective plot gets thickened by lots of pointless elements and annoying conspiracy theories while it should just be an entertaining horror movie it desperately tries to be an intelligent thriller and that's not what the fans look for there are a few innovative killings but they're not satisfying enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie and besides phantom of the mall could have used at least a bit of humor this entire production the cast included takes itself way too serious br br i'll try to finish with a few positive aspects like for example it stars ken foree die hard horror fans will certainly recognize him as peter for dawn of the dead that's like the horror milestone that yet has to find an equal even though his role in this movie is limited and even completely unnecessary it was good to see him again tv movie fans will also recognize morgan fairchild as the mayor she's a fine actress and an elegant lady pauly shore is also in this but i can't stand him so my opinion about him may be a bit biased and finally a bit of praise for the leading actress named kari whitman she's an extremely beautiful girl and she does have a bit of talent too bad she never made it to the top actually this movie is her biggest achievement and that says enough about her career
<START> the title of this film is taken from a party game called seven minutes in heaven the game was popular among my husband's friends when he was in junior high school in brooklyn ny and he describes it as something like spin the bottle lifesaver relay and other preteen kissing games according to the rules a boy's name and a girl's would be drawn and the chosen ones ordered to get into a dark closet together and to stay there for seven minutes in the meantime there would be speculation among party guests as to whether or not the two had the nerve to hold hands embrace and or kiss each other in the privacy of the closet at the end of seven minutes the game leader would say time's up or knock on the closet door and the couple would emerge from the closet after being quizzed by the other guests the couple would have to admit what they had done during their seven minutes in heaven then other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests had participated the couple who admitted to doing the most would be the winners of the game br br such games have served as social ice breakers for children and teens but they can be embarrassing and intimidating to shy individuals the film has been given this title because it deals with the teens' first experiences with crushes and romantic love
<START> spoilers br br what is this movie offering out of control editing and cinematography that matches up with a terrible plot it is sad to see denzel washington's talents go wasted in trashes like this we are certainly hinted how the mexicans cannot save themselves outside forces needed possibly militaristic american ones and we know the father is a shady character he is a mexican after all unlike the wife who appreciates creasey more because he is american he killed all of them thinking she died and did she of course she won't she is a young kid and you are not supposed to hurt the sensibilities of the hollywood fan the trade off scene was the only thing that prevents me from rating it below the implausibly successful as some critic pointed out 'taken' the nausea of such movies will take time to go it is in the rating of such movies that we have to doubt imdb's credulity 7 7 for a movie like this and 7 0 for my own private idaho go figure mine will be in the range of 3 5 4 0
<START> though structured totally different from the book by tim krabbÃ© who wrote the original 'the vanishing' spoorloos it does have the same overall feel except for that koolhoven's style is less business like and more lyric the beginning is great the middle is fine but the sting is in the end a surprise emotional ending as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully never explicit but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour it is a shame american films can't be as open an honoust as this one where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject 'de grot' stays always within the boundaries of good taste 'de grot' tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years when you'll leave the cinema you'll be moved what can we ask more of a film anyway this film even gives more
<START> this show was laughably bad the writing sucked the dialog sucked the guy who played craig couldn't act his way out of a paper sack being it was on thursday night this was definitely great to watch with some beers cool music bad acting poor writing all came together for my entertainment br br it was a drama unintentional comedy i don't care what happened to any of the characters they were all boring and stupid the first five episodes were the worst since they couldn't reveal who the victim was they had to write the dialog around it which was terrible i mean the eulogy at the funeral was ridiculous actually all the scenes that occurred in the present were utterly horrible br br so let's review everything happening in present time sucked the flashback scenes only the writing dialog and craig's acting sucked the music ruled though
<START> i watched this on the tube last night the actor's involved first caught my attention the first scenes were attention getters some funny some sad good character development i felt that the latter third of the film diverged if it was not for the early part of the movie i would have stopped watching i kept watching wanting to how how it tied together br br unfortunately i feel that it never happened i especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish was that the other shoe br br would i recommend no i think not as other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated 60's jive but it was not too distracting the ending totally turned me off
<START> this is a formula b science fiction movie and the director made no bones about it it is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team everything done is stuff you've seen many times before it is a weak script with no real characters in fact it is full of stereotype characters and situations the director attacks this by just making it a formula movie with no attempt to fool us and that gives this movie a mild appeal but it isn't something you're likely to remember a while it is best seen while you're cooking cleaning working out sort of mindless fun it has its place in entertainment but it certainly isn't something you sit down with friends to watch unless you're all just drunk and don't care the mass rating of 3 2 is probably fair i don't think it is as crappy as most people but i am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular that really eludes me as i see no attempt to even make this a memorable film
<START> being a big fan of corman's horror movies i expected from his western a bit more than i got well i was entertained all right i had almost as many laughs as watching mel brooks' blazing saddles br br see the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the prairie of the old west you can kill time by counting them if there happens to be an otherwise boring scene going on and the horses seem to have gears in them too considered the fast forward chases see also the swinging bar room queens of the traditional wild west saloon doing a number that reminds of a certain fashionable dance from 1920's here decades before the style was invented hope the saloon around them won't crumple br br in the middle of all this mayhem the main actors do a decent job ireland garland and hayes are all truly fine a special praise for them for doing the best they could with the material that seems mostly having been lifted from 'johnny guitar' but doesn't quite impress the same way but there is really nothing wrong with a laughable western like this just like a really bad old horror movie it might fail one way but succeeds to give joy anyway that is one of the reasons corman's work appeals to me and that is why i dare to recommend you to experience this movie if you get the chance
<START> this document truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the united states thought about the september 11th attacks this film was expertly put together and presents this disaster as more than an attack on u s soil the aftermath of this disaster is previewed from many different countries and perspectives i believe that this film should be more widely distributed for this point it also helps in the the healing process to finally see something other than news reports on the terrorist attacks and some of the pieces are actually funny but not abusively so this film came highly recommended to me and i pass on the same feeling
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br mcbain played by gary busey before the name became synonymous with the character in the simpsons is a typically unorthodox cop who gets results but winds his superiors up something rotten avoiding the clichÃ© of his partner being killed at the beginning of the film the plot instead takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to mexico where a top secret american super tank with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities has been smuggled through only to be taken hostage along with the crew by a gang of terrorists br br this cheap looking even by 80s standards boring little action film was a bizarre career move for gary busey after making an impression as the flame haired villain mr joshua in lethal weapon he just goes through the motions with his cardboard character here edgy and zany as ever with 'butthorn' being his trademark put down for the bad guys but without the material to back him up henry silva has presence as a screen villain but he's totally miscast here as an arab leader in a red beret and the awful script gives him some really clunky lines of dull dialogue that make his performance come off as laughably wooden he's just one of a host of action film character actors including l q jones and lincoln kilpatrick who pop up but fail to add anything to the mix after a dull first half without much exciting action things do pick up a bit at the end but it's too little too late and none of it manages the task of being any fun
<START> the larger than life figures of wyatt earp and bat masterson and the specters of george armstrong custer and sitting bull loom over director anthony mann's hugely entertaining first western with james stewart although stewart's quest to avenge his father's murder is the primary story winchester '73 is really an ensemble piece with the eponymous one in a thousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners including a wry trader john mcintire especially great and outlaw dan duryea who's even more despicable than usual the film's conflation of fiction and history produces a breezy pace and an ambivalent tone brilliantly in step with mann's pared down compositionally rigorous film making his themes of psychological unrest and past dictating present faintly underlie this tall tale of good and bad men chasing after a fabled gun but they starkly emerge in a vignette about a husband's cowardice and failed attempt at atonement and are defined in stewart's conversations with sidekick millard mitchell mann's use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns instead of gazing at vistas from afar he incorporates them into the drama as characters that redirect complicate or evoke the human characters' goals just as mountains caves and rapids had to be accounted for in the naked spur here a gunfight occurs amidst the loose rocks and boulders of a small mountain a physical obstruction that fatalistically determines the roles of victor and victim between two equally skilled sharpshooters i would be remiss in not recognizing cinematographer william h daniels's contribution particularly his superlative day for night open range photography not merely an adept outdoorsman mann presents an equally vivid picture of wyatt earp patrolled dodge city primarily through scaled multiple plane staging the shooting contest does not depend on brisk camera shifts or twitchy cuts for effect because mann instinctively knows where to place the camera and how to move it to display the greatest density of information in a given shot nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue relying on the actors' eyes or a well chosen image to convey the stakes one scene in particular serves to explain his attitude mitchell's telling of stewart's motivation to shelley winters which is interrupted by the climactic gunfight that soon enough reveals all light without feeling insubstantial intense without being overbearing winchester '73 seems more modern than its contemporaries and is a joy to behold
<START> i guess if you are into the sci fi and horror stuff it might be interesting the acting was okay but not great the two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen but are played by obviously older actresses who turned out to be twenty and twenty one at the time the plot is okay but the story does jump around a bit leaving one guessing whether you're in boston or pennsylvania the priest seems to use warp speed between the two the catholic church is portrayed as having a secretive sect for investigating events which only happen to those of that faith what if the two girls had been protestant would the catholics of cared therefore some what contrived who knows some day the catholic church might even learn what the bible teaches if you miss this one don't feel you've lost anything
<START> part ii or formerly known as guerilla is also a great achievement but not quite as entertaining as part i because this is where we begin to witness what might have caused the fall and death of che guevara once again i'm impressed by the cause and effect that both parts have in their interconnecting stories we're reminded again and again that the lead character che guevara is an argentine some of the men in fidel's army chose not to take orders from a foreigner and now that che has chosen to leave the comfort of victory to continue the revolutionary in bolivia he doesn't get much respect from his new army and the natives either only because he's a foreigner br br as far as technical goes i think part ii would've been more helpful if before everything else right after the display of the map it would show some highlights from the previous installment just to refresh memory about his characters and what he's set himself on doing to make the audience understand why his methods was successful in cuba but they don't work in bolivia it is clear now in this segment that che is not as charismatic as fidel castro in bolivia he's dealing with a bunch of soldiers whose hearts are not fully in it it's said that the ingredient for revolutionary is love well they don't give a damn that much about their country so it's a tough sell it's excruciatingly painful and difficult for che to get the others to buy into his vision br br i like one particular scene that illustrates che's deteriorating condition a scene in which his horse would not go no matter how badly che tries to direct it and then his temper took the better of him and for a moment there he forgets he's a doctor and he becomes this desperate soldier who's stabs his own horse his army is like a horse that doesn't want to be led but at the same time the film drags it relies on small cameos from familiar faces that you'll recognize just for the sake of brief entertainment and for the most part you get pounded left and right by one obstacle after another but maybe that is the intention of part ii if so then it definitely works standing ovation to the cinematography that gives us a first person view at the moment of che's last breath this movie may not answer the questions of why che guevara was so stubborn why he was so determined he could pull it off even wen the odds were against him and why he deeply wants south america to have the same fate as cuba but the movie che is a story worth telling
<START> in a series chock full of brilliant episodes this one stands out as one of my very favorites it's not the most profound episode there's no great meaning or message but it's a lot of fun and there are some fine performances br br but what makes it really stand out for me is that it is to my knowledge the only twilight zone episode with a double snapper ending the zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story but this time you get a surprise and think that's that but it turns out there's another surprise waiting i just like that so much that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes the other being a deeper more message oriented one
<START> damn i thought i'd seen some bad westerns can't top this one though hell i think i'd rather have my eyes stapled open for a trinity triple feature for cryin out loud i dont think i'll be able to watch ben hur again without laughing my ass off just really bad br br but hey if you like stupid westerns with acknowledged stars in the thing take a peek at shoot out with gregory peck it's just as bad but much funnier 1 10
<START> have no illusions this is a morality story granger is the troubled ex buffalo hunter tempted back to the plains one more time by kill crazed taylor granger can see the end is near and feels deeply for the cost of the hunt on the herds the indians and the land itself taylor on the other hand admittedly equates killing buffalo or indians to 'being with a woman ' while granger's role of the tortured hunter is superb it's taylor who steals the show as the demented immoral 'everyman' out for the fast buck and the goodtimes there's not a lot of bang bang here but the story moves along quickly and we are treated to a fine character performance by nolan the theme of this story is just as poignant today as in the 1800s man's relationship to the land and what's on it and racism considering when this was made the censors must have been wringing their hankies during the scenes in the 'bawdy house' taylor's relationship with the squaw and much of the dialogue although downbeat this is truly a great western picture
<START> the plot of astronuat returns to earth as a mutating monster died out in the 1950s mainly down to the scientific fact that travelling outside the earth's orbit doesn't humans cause to turn in to mutated monsters and that the first film to use this plot the quatermass experiment was the only decent sci fi movie to use the idea so the idea of having the redundant plot return seems doomed from the start alas watching the incredible melting man it seems the plot is the least of its problems br br first of all this is an incredibly badly made movie the budget is in single figures and i'm talking about lira not dollars there is no cinematography to speak of and there's countless editing blunders for example a photographer takes his barely legal model for a photo shoot cut to a shot where the sun is directly behind model then cut to shot of photographer where the sun is directly behind him then cut back to the model where the sun is br br the lack of budget drags the film down in other aspects too according to the trivia page the budget was so low the producers couldn't get any stock footage of saturn so when astronaut steve west mentions how beautiful saturn looks we get footage of the sun actually the sun gives the most impressive performance in the film since the human actors wouldn't be employed by a porn studio if i was appearing in this i wouldn't be scared by the eponymous monster i'd be terrified of splinters from the rest of the cast perhaps we should be slightly forgiving though since the obvious lack of budget manifests itself in things like the actors having to wear their own clothes a general for instance doesn't wear his nice fancy dress uniform complete with medals he wears a denim jacket and baseball cap br br there has to be suspension of disbelief for a film like this to work but it fails on every level the tone is set early on in the film where mr melty murders a nurse and escapes from the hospital instead of the police getting a call saying there's been a murder dr nelson just decides to track down his patient on his own own same as he'd look for a missing cat it's also strange a thoroughly decomposing homicidal monster can walk down the road without anyone noticing but this is typical of a film where horny 70 year olds stop their car down dark roads for a quickie and people nonchalantly mention their wife is pregnant whilst forgetting to tell the police that there's a monster on the loose br br the incredible melting man is z grade rubbish i can certainly understand why people enjoy this movie because it does reach the heights of it's so bad it's good but apart from rick baker's sometimes impressive make up effects it's nothing more than a very guilty pleasure
<START> i am curious is really two films in one half of it is the sexual experimental side of lena and the other half is her curiosity with political socialism whatever the director's intention the two don't really mesh together the director should have just stuck with the romantic side of lena and made a separate movie for the politics there is a bizarre mixture of political war rallies dr king serious political interviews flopping breasts and pubic hair the film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie other than the interesting sex scenes you'll be bored dry watching this film unlike many other reviewers i think the nude sexual scenes are overdone for what it is if you want to see real porn i'm sure there are better choices the pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is i think the cast did a fine job however they played their parts believably there is little of the over the topness i'm so used to seeing in the american films during this time
