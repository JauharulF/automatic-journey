<START> police story is a stunning series of set pieces for jackie chan to show his unique talents and bravery some of the stunts here are among jackie's best and most dangerous the whole mall fight finale is probably jackie's greatest single fight sequence more brutal and less comedic then say project a or drunken master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of the impact br br but unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't hold up to this quality as it is a rather formulaic cop thriller with some comedy elements i always prefer jc in films such as project a where his natural comic talents shine through in the serious confines of some elements of police story it just doesn't work for me having said that though this is still up there with jackies best films due to the incredible stunt work and sheer spectacle br br as usual with hong kong films avoid the english dubbed dvd version as it is truly awful stick with the subtitles br br great stunts ok movie a fine starting point if you've not seen a jc movie before and well worth a watch for any movie fan 7 10
<START> save your money i have been a fan of fullmoon productions for a long time and i have never seen them make a movie as bad as this the casting is terrible the story is even worse and the special affects are worse than any movie iv'e seen sence the 80's this movie is so bad i cant even suggest renting it
<START> does this film suck horrible acting horrible script horrible effects horrible horrible horrible nothing redeeming here for even the most die hard of horror fans a crazy killer stalks students at a college people are showing up dead in the hallways but still class carries on as normal after about the 4th body i would think that they could allow the students a few days break lol this about as bad as it gets folks this film should be shown as a means of torture to criminals you have been warned
<START> ching siu tung's and tsui hark's a chinese ghost story aside from being one of the greatest wuxia pian films ever made is a beautiful and romantic love story as well as an impressively choreographed martial arts film that should belong in every film lover's collection the sorely missed hong kong superstar leslie cheung plays a traveling tax collector who spends the night at a haunted temple while staying at the temple he meets a colorful cast of characters that include the swordsmen yin wu ma and hsiao hou the tree devil and the beautiful ghost lit sin seen played by the lovely joey wong br br to free her from the clutches of the evil tree devil he must reincarnate her body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon br br enough good things can't be said about this film the pacing is perfect with a great combination of romance action fantasy and humor and the feverishly paced finale should leave you with little chance to breathe the chemistry between the wonderfully tragic joey wong and leslie cheung whose legendary career ended much too soon really allows the viewer to feel for both of them indeed the acting on the whole is so vivacious and full of life i would say this is one of the most fun viewing experiences i've ever had much of the credit goes to wu ma in his portrayal of the mysterious swordsman yin his over the top persona of a disillusioned swordsman hell bent on vanquishing evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional hk drama a wonderful score lush cinematography with eye popping colors and frenetic action pieces courtesy of ching siu tung round out this wonderful film find a copy anywhere you can 10 10
<START> this book based movie is truly awful and a big disappointment we've been waiting for this move over a month many film reviewer were hopeful for it also in newspapers and tv it made big sense when 29th april comes many people regretfully noticed that movie is really awful why first of all story was so monotone it has been many indefinite scenes sometimes it's hard to realize what's going on the actresses out of hulya avsar weren't harmonized with their roles especially vildan atasever she acts better in comedy films in this movie a kind of drama she couldn't disposed of her previous role and finally movie is too short just 66 minutes
<START> here let me wave my hands over the keyboard i'll tell you what salad she's going to order over and over works like a charm he's such a genius omg how does he do it my bullshit detector freaks if i even pass this show when i'm scanning channels i have to be very careful these days it's useful far too often so i don't need it getting broken on idiotic crap like this careful with that remote is this supposed to be some fascist propaganda to make people believe in some invisible realm of uberman control and mastery or what why does it exist br br this is the most inane show completely unbelievable and contrived and i cannot understand why it's still on the air so may geeks give so much better shows such a hard time sarah connor chronicles true blood but give this nonsensical drivel a pass shows like firefly if there were any like that fall away after a season but mindless stuff like this that makes zero logical sense just keeps marching on yeccch
<START> if i sit down i will never stand up again that's what the mother the one of the title says to his son when he tells her to get some rest she's just widowed he means that resting is what a woman of his age and in her situation has to do to rest in peace to neglect herself but she's not in the mood for resting not yet she also has a daughter who reproaches her for each and every disasters in her life suddenly the revelation comes sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her daniel craig the brand new james bond when she thought nobody would ever touch her again it is a story that makes you reflect on many things specially on what's a 60 something woman is supposed to do with her life when his husband dies it doesn't look that we've advanced that such in those aspects i mean nobody's surprised when sean connery has a love affair in a movie with catherine zeta jones but what would you think if it was otherwise an old woman a young guy nah you ain't ready for that are you br br the movie has intimist tones all along its length except for 2 or 3 sequences in which that tones breaks and out comes some explicit and foul mouthed dialogs those vulgar touches and the way the son and the daughter find out their mother's love affair pretty absurd you'll know what i mean when you watch it are the only discordant elements in the mother br br my rate 7 10
<START> the acting wasn't great the story was full of simplistic turns and transparent characters it's about the repercussions of the struggle between right wing flemish block voters on the one side and the moroccon people living in the belgian city antwerp on the other side is it a political analysis is it some kind of belgian west side story or modern romeo and juliet the film just isn't strong enough to answer both questions supposing those were the director's questions too still some of the scenes could function as a kind of ken loach film set in antwerp after all this city has been the starting point of the extremist right wing flemish block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures it's very difficult to make a film about this situation and this one isn't successful unfortunately still it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present day belgium the few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt belgium a 10 million people country in the 2000s br br dries van dongen
<START> i read this thornton wilder play last year in eighth grade i was also forced to sit through this weak translation of it on screen let me tell you it's not a terrific play it is easily surpassed but man it deserves a much better shot the acting was really lacking the scenery honest to god looked like it was designed out of cardboard by a group of three year olds as if it couldn't get worse the sound quality is lousy there is this mind numbing 'buzz' whenever an actor speaks and i also couldn't help but notice that the chemistry between george and emily well is non existant the actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there there is no music it is in black and white which would be ok but it brings out the cheesiness of it all the more in any case i think that if you're going to make a point of seeing this movie which i don't really reccomend then don't aim your hopes to high the play as stalwart as it is is probably better
<START> if john thaw had never played morse kavanagh or starred in the sweeney and other productions he'd be remembered for this wonderfully unforgettable performance in goodnight mr tom br br superbly supported by an equally tremendous performance by his co star young nick robinson in his first role and an unobtrusive cast this adaptation of michelle magorian's charming novel is a fitting memorial to his art br br when i read this story of an old widowed norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from london before and during the blitz i found a rather obvious time line error in it and credit must go to the makers of this film for rectifying this error they also must be applauded for not over sentimentalising the tale and preventing what could have been turned quite easily into a mushy mess br br if you keep a cd or video library then this feel good made for tv movie is an absolute must inclusion
<START> mendez and marichal have provided us with a serious cogent and painful analysis of the social spiritual economic and political crisis that 108 years of colonialism have spawned in puerto rico a beautiful island with the most hospitable people i have met and yet because our nation refuses to faces its imperial responsibilities puerto ricans are allowed to wither and die br br the spiritual crisis that the colonial situation of puerto rico has created if undermining families and the basic institutions that sustain any society corruption is rampant to the extent that people are not paying taxes which has led a fiscal crisis for this nation and a sense of cynicism and distrust permeate the island's culture br br fortunately a grant allowed this painful yet powerful film to be produced br br a must see
<START> it's hard to tell you more about this film without spoiling it i enjoyed it because i wasn't expecting what i was seeing but an ordinary sex drama so it's a pscyho sexual thriller in which nothing is what it seems it features emmanuelle seigner no stranger to the genre and to nudity in which her husband polanski had directed her and a creepy performance did i say creepy yes creepy from toreton bernard tavernier's actor it looks like a pascal bruckner meets roman polanski better than bitter moon like a chabrol gone astray or clouzot thriller i have seen someone mentioning les diaboliques but closer to georges franju's les yeux sans visage eyes without a face the godfather of dr phibes and more a gem i am just afraid they will blow this into a hollywood remake like they did with nighwatch and the vanishing
<START> rajkumar santoshi without any doubt has directed the greatest movies and biggest box office hits of indian cinema br br this movie falls short of all expectations as this movie stars two great actors mr amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar and when you have these two actors in the same movie you have to make a magnum opus br br in the later part of the movie you can make out that amitabh bachchan's voice has been dubbed by some other person which was due to his illness br br still the movie did'nt had proper character development plus cinematography was'nt good too and one thing that bollywood should learn is that they should use visual effects only when it is needed and when applied should be done with a high budget the script had so many flaws which gives the viewer excuses to attend his phone calls rather than watching the movie br br the new comer shakes the leg well but could not act well but where the movie loses big time is the storyline screenplay and cinematography br br a talented actor like bhoomika chawla has been wasted in the movie as well as sushant singh br br but every director once in a while in his career makes a bad film br br so watch it only if you are a fan of multi starrer flop movies
<START> i saw this movie on the hallmark channel and thought it was wonderful especially since it was based on a true man pierce brosnan was very good as the loner english man who took on the persona of the half breed grey owl the photography was beautiful br br this movie made me do more research into this character archie belaney known simple as grey owl i want to read as much as i can about him at the time i did not know richard attenborough had directed it but i am not surprised i like all his movies whether he is acting or directing i gave it the highest rating however i would have liked to have seen more in the movie about why he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their house br br you can't go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes
<START> my wife and i found this film to be highly unsatisfying while the plot keeps you interested and busy wondering just what is going on when you leave the theater there are just too many loose ends that make no sense at all spoilers ahead christopher plummer enormously wealthy head of a ny bank has a terrible hidden secret profiting from ww ii deals with the nazis and hiding loot stolen from jews he keeps the evidence including diamonds and documents with the nazi swastika in a safety deposit box in his bank why if he wants this never to be revealed why did he not burn and destroy the documents years ago and the diamonds obviously he does not need them why keep them rather than dispose of them how did the bank robbers find out his secret how did they know to zero in on this very safety deposit box 232 ace detective denzel washington also discovers bank records show sd boxes no's 231 and 233 but no 232 curious he meticulously found time somehow to do an exhausting search of bank records to unearth this one curious fact all the while dealing with a red hot hostage situation and bank robbers threatening to start executing them momentarily wow talk about super powers for a detective br br the bank robbers leave behind millions of dollars in loose currency in the vault they have opened they take only the contents of sd box 232 ostensibly for the purpose of blackmailing the bank president this defies any rational attempt at a logical explanation for what the film depicts as a criminal mastermind or for his henchmen with lesser brains br br jodie foster using her political connections with the mayor of nyc gains permission to enter the bank which is under the control of the bank robbers while holding many hostages she offers the chief bank robber a deal to buy back the documents he now has in hand but he ain't interested so what's his point if any br br my wife was offended by the arrogance of all the players christopher plummer bank president denzel washington ace detective and jodie foster crack trouble shooter for high powered problems br br the last jodie foster movie i saw flight plan was also riddled with holes that made no sense at all i thought i liked jodie foster but i will probably avoid her future films br br now my problem is that i can rarely persuade my wife to go to the movies i cannot disagree with her on this one a waste of money and a waste of time be forewarned a well crafted film fine actors lousy script writing
<START> this was the worst film i have seen for a long time br br not only that it has nearly nothing to do with the other american pie movies the story is obvious flat and absolutely not funny br br the girls are nice though but spending your time watching a cheap soft porno would possibly be greater than watching this film br br this film seems to be a very bad made sex ad made for an audience that is not older than 12 br br i never visited an american college but i would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh about any of the scenes br br save your time do something else
<START> i don't often give one star reviews but the computer won't let me do negative numbers br br the opening titles tell us we're in deep water already although this is a low budget exploitation film there are 17 producers credited no no br br at the beginning of the story abusive husband kenneth comes home to his family in an upscale gated community the house is a pigsty his wife della kim basinger has let the children run amok all day br br ok we're already in deep water ms basinger was 55 years old when the film came out uh are these her children or grandchildren it's christmas eve della drives to the mall a lengthy scene that could have been cut to bludgeon home the idea of eeeeeeevil male aggression rampant in the universe she drives past football players in full uniform playing in pouring rain on christmas eve sure for a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it br br we get some actual suspense in the driving scenes though it's raining and traffic is bad first we see della try to drive and smoke at the same time then later della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time at one point turning completely around to check the cluttered back seat for the charger for the phone br br she wanders the mall sees an old friend from college tries to buy stuff but her credit card is declined gosh maybe her husband is grumpy because he's going broke but that's too complicated for the script to follow br br in the parking lot she runs afoul of the most ludicrous gang in the history of films one white boy lukas hass watching his career go down the toilet one black one asian and one hispanic imagine a company of up with people gone to the bad and you'll have the idea br br although they have a gun she gives them attitude a mall cop comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head firing more than once the parking lot is crowded as can be people everywhere and nobody notices br br della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well lighted safe area she drives to a construction site where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools literally at hand br br major spoiler ahead br br she drives back home the car poops out so she walks through the pouring rain checks on the children goes downstairs and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank range br br the experience with the four punks was supposed to result in personal empowerment for della instead we know that her children will probably spend christmas in foster care or a group home because the state will collect them while she answers to murder one charges the four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self defense the husband different story br br i'm so glad i saw this on cable if i'd seen it in a theater did it get any release i'd have been furious as is i'm just sad seeing talents like ms basinger and mr haas waste themselves on garbage like this br br one very good thing though this was written and directed by susan montford ms montford has not gotten another writing or directing credit since passing this turd there is justice in the world
<START> when it comes to the erotic genre i'm lucky to get through the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to watch this movie is different julie davis i love you don't touch me directed two very strong lead actors kira reed and doug jeffery in this enthralling thriller kira is convincing as kim a sweet innocent romance novelist that gets caught in the web of seduction of doug jeffery's the man a handsome stranger kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role and as actress giving what could have been simply another t and a depth and believability i believe it to be her best performance yet and julie davis' direction is a great gift to erotica
<START> in a time when hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses despair crime drugs and war along comes this film which reminds us the concept of the indomitable spirit if you are feeling beaten down this movie will free your mind and set you soaring we all know how tough life can be sometime we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will get us through that's what this film did for me and i hope it will for you
<START> i read the book 7 years in tibet from heinrich harrer and was fascinated of it then i immediately grabbed the dvd and started to watch the movie i remember the first time i saw it back in 98 i kinda liked it well now i watched it again in full knowledge of the book it is based on and soon i realized how wrong it all was told br br when they enter lhasa the people start to stick their tongues out of their mouths and thewlis and pitt have the impression that its the way to say hello in tibet so they greet back in the book harrer explains that sticking the tongue out is a sign of absolute humbleness and loyalty in tibet and they may do it in front of the dalai lama but certainly not for these two europeans not only the mother but even the dalai lama himself was wearing glasses in the public in the book harrer mentions that no one in tibet wore glasses to that time sorry forgot the reason but its explained in the book too the young dalai lama did but only when he was alone and nobody could see him and what about that mao tse tung lookalike destroying the mandala in front of the young living buddha childish and the tailor made harrer and aufschnaiter tibetan clothes not european designer suits why are so many events that really happened eliminated from the story just to fill the time with a fictional love interest the female tailor that is completely unimportant just like the whole story about harrers son rolf not one word is mentioned about him or even any family member of harrer in the book but that was ok for me because 7 years in tibet is not a book about harrers person its about tibet i'm very disappointed by this adaption of the famous book and i bet heinrich harrer was too 3 stars just for the cinematography
