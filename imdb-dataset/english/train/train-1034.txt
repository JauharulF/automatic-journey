<START> this was a well written tale of the making of the batman sitcom and actually reunites our heroes on a great quest as well as offers their tv shows history unlike the brady's and partridge family documentary movies we not only get a look into the past and present lives of adam and burt but also get to see them back in action filled with kapow's and catwomen and the riddler s batman is back ina well told tale that not only gives us a satisfactory closing to the batman series but fills the modern fan in on all the hollywood tales that about them that haven't been heard in 35 years br br kudos
<START> i love this movie my only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed br br it's true that frank sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but it's also nice that it's not just another frank sinatra movie where it's mostly him doing the singing br br i actually thought it was better to use marlon brando's own voice as he has the voice that fits and i could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voice br br stubby kaye's sit down you're rockin' the boat is a foot tappin' sing a long that i just love he is a hard act to follow with his version and i still like his the best br br vivian blaine is just excellent in this part and adelaide's lament is my favorite of her songs br br i really thought jean simmons was perfect for this part maybe i would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part it made sense br br michael kidd's choreography is timeless if it were being re staged in the year 2008 i would not change a thing br br i find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version but this kept the feel of the stage even though it was on film br br i thought the movie was well cast i performed in regional versions of this and it's one of my favorites of that period
<START> wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller the film has some great drama between the characters and some good creepy scenes the acting is good the characters act like a normal family the wendigo effects are good the deer form reminded me a little of the rabbit in donnie darko br br the film sees a family going to stay at a house for a while but accidental hit a deer a group of hunters arrives and one of the hunters named otis starts to argue with the dad george after the car is lifted they drive off to the house the son miles is a little shook up about the deer but his parents try to tell him that it's natural for things like that to happen that night while he's in bed he starts to see weird things in bedroom the next day they go into to town and miles meets a man at the counter who gives him a little statue of the wendigo when miles shows kim the statue and tells her that a man at the counter gave it him the owner says the she only works there once returning home george takes his son sledding and while there sledding he's knocked off the board and miles is chases by the wind after gaining conciseness they go looking for george they find him outside the house where he tells them he was shot in the hospital kim tells the sheriff that otis may have shot him the shrieff goes to otis's place where he's bashed over the head with a hammer as otis drives down the road he finds that the wendigo is after him br br wendigo is a pretty good thriller that has some chilling moments check this out 10 10
<START> yeti curse of the snow demon starts aboard a plane full of american high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in japan unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the himalayas unlucky really with some dead some alive the survivors have to think about themselves decide to wait it out until help comes however just when they think their luck couldn't get any worse they soon discover that a huge hairy yeti type abominable snowman creature wants to kill eat them all trapped cold starving fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time br br yeah with a title like yeti curse of the snow demon it can only mean one thing that is that someone at the sci fi channel has made yet another 'creature feature' although to give these things a bit of variety the sci fi channel here in the uk are now dubbing them as a 'beast feast' as if that will make any difference directed by paul ziller one has to say that yeti curse of the snow deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time sure it's bad but it's sort of fun at times too the basic premise is alright actually it's a sort of cross between alive 1993 with it's plane crash the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive the excellent gory killer bigfoot another legendary hairy monster exploitation flick night of the demon 1980 which i would defend with my last breath i have to say it's not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as i said it's fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written the character's are mostly annoying american teens there's the expected arguing there's the macho hero the strong female the coward who thinks only of himself so there's no prizes for originality there are some plot holes too if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them how are you going to dig a large hole line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes why did the yeti not kill that bird at the end it had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her the 'there are actually two yeti's running around' twist isn't used to any effect at all either at least there's a good pace about the film it certainly moves along at a fair old pace i never found myself becoming bored with it there's some moderately gory action the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not if they are going to eat their dead mates or not br br the one thing you can always say about these sci fi channel 'creature features' or 'beast feasts' is that the cgi computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious so that proves to be the case yet again the plane crash at the start looks awful the yeti when it's cgi looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it's on a pogo stick there one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm a squashed head a ripped out heart some dead bodies some blood splatter the best bit when the yeti rips a guy in half beats him with his own ripped off legs before biting a big chunk out of them according to the imdb the actor playing the yeti took three a half hours to get into the suit the make up which seems like a long time since it's actually a pretty tatty looking creation apparently the original title was raksha curse of the snow demon with raksha meaning demon in tibetan sanskrit so now you know br br this has reasonable production values considering the usual sci fi channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh bleak himalayas was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm the acting isn't that good i didn't think any of the girls looked that good either which didn't help br br yeti curse of the snow demon is another terrible sc fi channel 'creature feature' if i am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this isn't too bad there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it's not very good
<START> when good times premiered in 1974 it was one the first black family sitcoms it centered on the poor chicago based evans family and their struggles to make ends most of the early episodes focused on the parents james and florida evans and their struggle to provide for the family john amos and esther rolle were the best part of the show they were terrific actors and had great chemistry as james and florida evans they had three kids j j thelma and michael j j was the skirt chasing but well meaning teenage son who made up for his lack of subtletly with artistic talent thelma was an attractive bright girl who was constantly trading insults with j j michael was a near child prodigy who was well educated on social issues and was destined to become a lawyer br br in 1976 the producers made a huge mistake by firing john amos literally killing off his character this really changed the focus and not for the good i might add the shows began to focus more on j j and his buffoon like behavior which angered black viewers as well as series star esther rolle who left after the next season instead of a show that focused on key african american issues that existed in society at the time viewers got shows that were overloaded with skirt chasing and fat jokes br br once esther rolle left the quality of the show suffered even more although it was still watchable it was no longer the great ground breaking show that it once was br br although esther rolle came back for the 1978 season it became obvious that the show was on its last legs all loose ends were tied up during that season and the show quietly faded off the air br br first three season a last three seasons c
<START> i just saw behind bedroom doors and this was the first softcore flick with a solid story behind it that i've seen in a while br br we begin with two neighborly couples vivian and james fenway julia kruis and eric carrington and lillian and gabe harris nicole sheridan and chris gustafson vivian appears to be a housewife james is a lawyer running for district attorney lillian works in real estate and gabe is a successful plastic surgeon got all that now let's get into it br br enter abby played beautifully by porn star chelsea blue she's renting the house across the street from the fenways and lives all by herself at the beginning of the movie james looks out his window and sees abby engaged in playtime with her girlfriend gigi played by prolific pornstress monique alexander and secretly begins to wonder what it would be like to be with her the next day abby gets acquainted with all four of them and appears to be a nice woman who just happens to be living an alternative lifestyle she makes a pass at vivian who seems startled and says to her oh i'm not that way everything seems okay until the plan gets set in motion br br first abby shows up at gabe's office naked asking gabe if she should get a boob job this is where we get our quote of the movie br br tell me about gabe what do you want to know is gabe happily married i'm married there's trouble let me guess your wife stays at home and does everything you ask but she's a good girl yes she's not a bad girl no does that door have a lock on it br br you know what happens next abby gets it on with gabe right there in the exam room after that she puts on a little show in her window for james who comes over and wastes no time in having sex with her what james doesn't know is that the teddy bear on the piano with the flashing red eye is really a camera taping all the festivities it's so obvious anyway abby has sex with gabe again later and this time gigi joins in to make it a three way now that abby has something on both men she requests 100 000 from each in order to buy her silence not only could she ruin james's run for office but she could destroy gabe's practice br br while gabe and james wrestle with their guilt abby finds time to seduce lillian who experimented with women in college that was a long time ago but you wouldn't know that seeing her in action with abby she looked like an old pro br br while gigi goes along with the plan she's seems jealous of all the sex her girlfriend is having it's only business abby says confessions and apologies are sure to follow as is some startling info on abby's true identity it seems she's been doing the same thing to different men in many different places gabe and james use this info to fight back against abby's blackmail br br now on to the sex the sex scenes were pretty good and considering all the women involved in this film except for julia kruis have a lengthy porn background i wouldn't have expected anything less nicole sheridan's four scenes were the best of the movie with the three way coming in a close second monique alexander only got naked once but she was a relatively minor character julia kruis was a major character and got naked the same number of times i suppose since she was surrounded by experienced hardcore pros she didn't have to have as many sex scenes br br to wrap up behind bedroom doors had a great storyline which enhanced the overall grade of the film i consider it tapeworthy br br women a nicole sheridan was good in this film better than her later offerings in fred olen ray's comedies at least she can do drama somewhat chelsea blue was a scene stealer she wasn't that bad as the antagonist i'd give her an a all by herself julia kruis was her usual self i wish monique alexander had more face time in this film though br br sex b solid very solid sex scenes nicole sheridan's performances were almost hardcore quality chelsea blue looked good in her scenes too the two girl girl offerings weren't scorching but they did warm up the screen br br story b i liked the dialogue and the main storyline chelsea blue's performance was good for the genre and i was impressed with nicole sheridan's turn at drama br br overall b this was a nice softcore flick i'm glad i was able to watch this one as i was pleasantly surprised if chelsea blue ever wanted to do more of these she'd be welcome anytime that goes for nicole sheridan too even though she's probably better at doing comedy i don't mind hardcore girls who can act doing softcore films
<START> i have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further br br nothing about this film worked absolutely nothing delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise ex jailbird at the same time her friend hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her she also happens to be sleeping with marlon who is desperately in love with her then there's delmar's brother jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father on the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film so far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life death grief and love in the first half the film simply loses direction br br if the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed for instance why does delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife why is hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly doesn't love her how is it missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight is jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems or is missy the exception has delmar and jethro's mother always been on the eccentric side or is it a more recent development why is jethro so keen on cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room why did moses spend years in prison for stealing a car a relatively minor crime how does delmar manage to end up giving birth to moses' baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex br br these questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered i can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script big mistake losing several subplots especially the hortense and marlon story which adds nothing to the overall film would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the delmar jethro and moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else br br add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all including jorja fox who does her best to rise above the material i'm not surprised that this appears to have been the director's last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story
<START> this reboot is like a processed mcdonald's meal compared to ang lee's very good but very underrated 2003 the incredible hulk br br ang lee's the hulk is a comic book movie for the thinking person the hulk takes some time to appear about 40 minutes but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonist's core he does his best to avoid losing control but as he admits when he does give in to his rage he likes it br br now compare this to edward norton's turn where there is no display of conflict in his personality and he turns into the hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute not 183 not 197 but exactly 200 to this reviewer this felt akin to the introduction of midi chlorians in the phantom menace which tell how strong the force is with one as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test in the 2008 movie all ed norton's bruce banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200 as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist and for the record it is extremely difficult to get one's pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run especially for a physically fit person br br emotions drive eric bana's hulk he has repressed memories of his mother's death and his father's role in his early life on the surface he is calm but there underneath there is significant anger enough rage to fuel the hulk when it is unleashed but the hulk never kills intentionally even his attackers mostly he just wants to get away or close to betty ross jennifer connelly he incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision br br in the 2003 movie the visual effects are there but as necessary the action scenes and there are plenty of them are necessary to the plot unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action br br in his quest to turn it into a fugitive story ed norton loses focus on how bruce banner feels about the hulk to him the hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry and louis leterrier the director picking up on ed norton's cue fails to add any emotional dimension to the banner hulk relationship the story can be summed up as banner is pursued and hulk kicks butt banner is pursed and hulk kick butt repeat as necessary br br the only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version however even as i am a fan of the comics i would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboy's dream but has heart over the comics loyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day br br perhaps ang lee should have read more comics iron man also released in 2008 is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic book roots and has heart
<START> man oh man i've been foolishly procrastinating not the right term there's a long list to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so and news are marvellous labyrinthine spectacle br br for any von trier's follower both rigets element of crime dogville dancer in the dark the five obstructions etc europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual terms everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic you really get the feeling of being inside this imaginary nightmarish time warp taking from the masters of surreal cinema like bunuel bergman till noir films of the 40's with acidic drops of avant guard von trier leads the art film scene as the well intended totalitarian movie maker of nowadays his authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate issues without being irrational hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world br br as utopian as it seems i do believe people like von trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect the day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no longer necessary as a tool for reflection perhaps it could be the start of a new era the age of emotional control over our fears this is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and over br br bravo
<START> dear friends and family br br i guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen then that's their eternal damnation just remember kids birth control doesn't mean oral sex i don't care what the honor student says on the other hand even if the senator's aid quotes himself as a bit of a romantic guy he's still only hitting on a high school girl if she was my sister i'd eat this guys kneecaps br br other than that i found out that mongolians don't kiss the same way the french do and that baseball players named zoo like delicate undergarments br br i think i'd almost rather watch richie rich one more time than suffer the indignity of this slip slap slop thank you and good night
<START> so this was an hbo made for tv movie eh is that an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible acting such a shame to see jim belushi reduced to a role so repetitive shot at survived lies beaten up survives shot at lies and so ad infinitum call that a script as for the brits embarrassing to see timothy dalton's pathetic or was he just taking the p depends how much he was paid i guess attempt at a southern sheriff as for that other brit the bleached blond one what a w er there is a trend towards glorifying these english speaking sic super violent thugs lately perhaps thanks to mr madonna's two movies succeed in entertaining and justify the violence by skillful use of irony and humour like pulp fiction does however this movie discredits and devalues the genre definately one to miss
<START> wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary
<START> i saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from nyc after 30 minutes i said to him you've got to be kidding is this some sort of joke he thought it was good i told him that i thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made what was it supposed to be i asked a propaganda movie made for children the plot is stupid the acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life love or even afterlife of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view need some psychiatric help please if someone tries to get you to stick this in your dvd or video player consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computer it won't destroy your player but it will destroy your evening if they had made razzies in the '40s this would have won in every category ps it also goes under the dubious sobriquet of stairway to heaven
<START> charlotte's deadly beauty and lethal kicks make the movie cooler than it'd be otherwise the story is so poor and charlotte's character dies in such a foolish way that you wonder if this's the ending they had thought of for this movie i wish somebody could tell that an alternative ending exists but i fear it doesn't as for the rest of the cst well i'd say they simply didn't act very well although the blame should be put on the poor script this movie reminds me of rush hour 2 where zhang ziyi dies in absurd way since she had been the only one who had stolen the show during the whole movie i could give this movie 2 5
<START> the summary pretty much sums it all up this is nowhere near as good as the original with a script co written by both stallone and james cameron at the same time he was also writing aliens most of the action was written by cameron and the political aspects were written by stallone br br sly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and rocky 4 and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids depending on your own viewpoint or opinion br br rambo starts off in prison and is visited by colonel trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a presidential pardon he eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by charles napier playing a washington suit trying to pass himself off as former ex forces to placate rambo br br the mission is to find out if there are any missing pows still alive in camps in vietnam rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself he is told it's not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos only br br after a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit meets his contact who turns out to be a cute woman and travels down river with pirates to the camp br br he finds there are still prisoners and rescues one as the 3 flee from half the vietnamese army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pick up point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with rambo almost on board br br rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter it is clear as trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be found br br steven berkoff turns up as a russian spetznatz colonel and rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more vietnamese troops and spetznatz killing many of them rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his base br br he resists the urge to kill napier for abandoning him but destroys the ops centre br br a weak plot and very weak ending as rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man
<START> i remember my parents not understanding saturday night live when i was 15 they also did not understand rock n roll and many other things now that i am approaching their age i still remember and find i understand many of the things my kids love but this is pathetic i cannot say i have seen any by sarah except for a few appearances here and there they were reasonable i do not see her as anything special but this show is just so far below what i expected from her the imdb write up made it sound like potential so just for that i started watching the first episode i turned it off half way through anything else is better that that jokes that are meant for a 5 year old presented on a supposed adult program well sarah this adult is inly moved to turn you off i just cant believe that someone actually financed this insult to comedy only good thing i can say is that there are sooooo many bad jokes deposited here saving other shows from such an embarrassment
<START> i realize that living in the western plains of wyoming during the 1900s was brutal in fact it probably is still brutal today but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly made for tv movie also women's rights were still budding in this nation during this time so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory and still show the realism of the era Â would it make for good viewing honestly i don't know i have thought about this film for the past two days and i still can't seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film yet i can truthfully tell you that it wasn't the greatest i have ever seen from several hodgepodge styles of acting to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character to some of the most gruesome pg rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema it is hard to fully get a good grasp on heartland was it good was it bad that may be up for you to view and decide yourself but until then here are moments i enjoyed and desperately hated br br this film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes scenes where i wasn't sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole i thought the story as a whole was a very interesting historical tale i do not know much about living in wyoming especially during the early 1900s so this film captured that image in my mind the thought of very cold winters no neighbors for miles upon miles and this polaroid esquire view untouched by corporate america it was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience though the television there were scenes that really stood out in my mind like the cattle branding scene the pig slaughtering scene and the saddening homesteader that didn't survive their journey that just brought a true sense of realism to this story director richard pearce did a great job of bringing the view of wyoming to the viewers but i am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the view br br while i will constantly compliment the scenery of this film i had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side rip torn seemed out of place in his role as clyde stewart a loner that somehow finds a connection with conchata ferrell's elinore randall the two as actors have no chemistry at all their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion the pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two veteran actors portrayed it the brave elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her while clyde gives an approving nod when she is done this is love was it supposed to be love i don't know i think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond but with torn and ferrell it felt like two actors just playing their parts other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse knocks on the door for food or shelter the constantly fading and growing compassion that clyde had for elinore's daughter i just didn't believe it the lack of true winter struggle and the entire land scene the land scene especially because i needed more explanation on what elinore was doing why she was doing it and why clyde would build her a house if they were married it was these simple events that if taken the time to explore would have made for a stronger film br br overall i will go middle of the road with this feature there were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of elinore but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation these panoramic scenes which in the span of 100 years have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers while there were some brilliant scenes of realism starring cattle and pigs i just felt as if we needed more depth was a key element lacking in this film which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world but instead left open loopholes and clichÃ©d western characters ferrell carried her own but torn was completely miscast decent for a viewing but will not be picked up again by me br br grade out of
<START> this show is possibly the biggest ugliest most generic steam pile i've seen in children's programming that's actually become successful the lead character johnny while i understand he's supposed to represent an ordinary kid isn't likable or even tolerable the jokes are lame overdone i e the whoa didn't see that coming gag come on that wasn't even funny the first time it's not even cute and lack any form of primitive wit or inspiration and lastly it's just plain ugly to look at while kids aren't especially critical of artistic talent they still prefer eye candy i can't stand watching the show because in a way the art style is just gross hideous in fact just plain crummy br br i just can't stand that this is getting so much airtime while i understand that nostalgia can be a little irrational and i shouldn't be getting my hopes up on it coming back i really miss the old cartoons bring back dexter's laboratory the powerpuff girls anything but this crap i guess it's just wishful thinking though br br simply put i advise you don't waste your time on this show i believe that truly good cartoons are able to be enjoyed by the big kids too and this doesn't cut it
<START> obviously i didn't care for things to come aka the shape of things to come as much as most viewers that means that there is a good chance that you'll enjoy it more than i did at any rate you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of view br br directed by william cameron menzies who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director this is a film adaptation by h g wells of his own novel by the same name in my eyes it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriter br br the film opens in 1940 in a london like everytown war is brewing and the citizens of everytown are worried that it might reach them it does and it turns into a decades long affair that basically destroys civilization wells and menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath we see two pilots one downed coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting we meet a post apocalyptic community ruled over by a would be warlord we meet a man from a burgeoning futuristic society we see the way that technology is changing and finally we're taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa 2036 where the leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moon br br that might all sound potentially very exciting but it just does not work as a film structurally the film is far too episodic with little to dramatically tie it together by the third segment i completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters i had barely been able to sort them out in the first couple segments there's a constant parade of new faces we don't get to learn anything about any of them br br it doesn't help that the individual segments with a couple exceptions tend to be awkwardly directed and edited they are also occasionally manipulative it can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film but maybe contradictorily the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionally br br in fact one overlong section is more like a music video industrial promotional video if features shots of building the futuristic city with lots of large machinery lots of welding and so on at one point a guy who looks like an astronaut waves at the camera through some kind of futuristic glass the music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overblown horror score i can't say that things to come consists of engaging material in terms of drama br br but the common cry in support of things to come is that it is a film about ideas that may be true but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way one it still doesn't make it work as a film that is as a visual and aural dramatic artwork and two there are far too many ideas presented here br br the principle idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations that's a fine thing to make a film about it's also remarkably prescient of world war ii as the things to come was scripted and filmed in 1935 released in 1936 wells has some interesting things to say about war some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film for example the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out or will at any moment the overall message seems a trifle pessimistic wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that cannot be excised although it doesn't preclude progress in fact maybe it fuels progress at least indirectly br br that would certainly be enough for one film however there are many more ideas here the scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film it deals with a complex dilemma one pilot has shot the other down but is now coming to assist him but the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas that is now billowing across the field they can't both breathe the gas without harm a girl comes along they only have two functioning gas masks between them the pilot who was shot down offers his mask as he says he's dying anyway what to do it's not that this scene itself could be stretched out to feature length but the ideas the bizarre complex of both helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a war are enough to build a film on br br another example during the scenes featuring the would be warlord in the post apocalyptic environment there is a nasty contagious disease called the wandering sickness going around it turns victims into something like drunken zombies the usual procedure is to shoot victims on site in an attempt to stave off the disease this material is dealt with as if it were an afterthought it's a great idea and deserved its own film br br similarly wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas that was enough for its own film too it's just impossible to effectively deal with so much stuff in 100 minutes especially when it's supposed to be the crux of the film in lieu of dramatic attraction br br still there are reasons to give things to come at least one viewing if you're at all a sci fi buff this is a historically important film given menzies' background the production and set designs are interesting even if the cinematography seems extremely dated it's also interesting to see how wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his predictions i particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon which was strongly reminiscent of george mÃ©liÃ¨s' 1902 a trip to the moon aka le voyage dans la lune just don't expect too much from things to come
<START> this film is terrible you don't really need to read this review further if you are planning on watching it suffice to say don't unless you are studying how not to make a good movie br br the acting is horrendous serious amateur hour throughout the movie i thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like michael madsen only to find out that it is actually him a new low even for him br br the plot is terrible people who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before even by the standard of hollywood action flicks this is a terrible movie br br don't watch it go for a jog instead at least you won't feel like killing yourself
