<START> i didn't think this was as absolutely horrible as some people apparently do it passes as one of those cheesy horror movies you might waste time with in the middle of the night when you can't sleep although admittedly it's no better quality than that it's true that the acting isn't great i thought marianne mcandrew as cathy beck for example came across as completely passionless but the main problem is that several aspects of the plot didn't really make sense to me the becks are on a trip described by john stewart moss as part work and partly the honeymoon they never had now that's romantic the work part has something to do with touring caves which in itself sounds strange how does being part of a tour group through a cave relate to anyone's work but it gets stranger when we find out that he's a doctor doing research in the area of preventative medicine huh that connection completely lost me bitten by a bat while he's in the cave he begins to transform into what i guess was supposed to be a human bat hybrid although when we finally see him in makeup he looks a lot more like an ape man of some sort and a killing spree starts here's another problem the first killing is a nurse in a hospital at first everyone thinks her death was an accident the second murder is of a young girl who is described as having her throat ripped out the sheriff michael pataki then tells us that her death was similar to the nurse's meaning throat ripped out how could anyone think that was an accident and what's with the sheriff he seems pretty no nonsense until the scene in cathy's hotel room when he takes a swig of liquor and then almost rapes her after which everything seems to go back to normal it's saddled with an ending that left almost everything unresolved and also with one of the most irritating theme songs i've ever heard in a movie even for all that there was something here that kept me watching sometimes pure cheesiness can get you through an hour and a half pretty bad yeah but not as awful as some people say
<START> wow i loved this movie and love judy marte this girl isn't just an awesome pretty face she's funny and really really talented she made me laugh many times just by being very naturally rough with victor who was desperately hitting on her we'll be seeing her a lot in the next coming years and probably also from director peter sollett and co star victor rasuk br br raising victor vargas is one of the best film i saw in a long time very refreshing it's true nice funny well filmed it got it all good story good actors good film direction br br if you like simple slow paced real life urban movies like maybe jersey girl from kevin smith you'll love victor vargas it's better
<START> this is a better than average silent movie and it's still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents however if you aren't yet a fan of the genre i suggest you try a few other films before watching this one that's because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots but despite this it's still a good film and kept my interest br br a nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him the film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief despite this she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life however the rent is due and there's no money so the lady is forced to look for work she becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal unfortunately the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can't make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man's date well like cinderella she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her what to do now given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her well see the movie yourself to see how it's all resolved i didn't like how they handled the husband as it seemed awfully predictable and clichÃ©d however once he was out of the way i do admire how the film also didn't give up a by the numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends br br all in all a very good film worth seeing but certainly not great
<START> i think this is almost all i need to say i feel obliged to explain my actions though i've basically never seen such an armature production and i mean that in all senses of the word although he physical camera work boom mic operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable unfortunately its not the only areas br br unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot this unfortunately has an awful script awful acting and worst of all awful annoying characters br br it's a crime that for the every independent film that gets distribution like haiku tunnel there's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths i don't know who the kornbluth brothers know at sony but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution i'm quite bemused as to why they picked this up br br the only part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title however the reason for that is even a let down i hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it i've seen a lot of films in my time and i'm very forgiving when in the cinema but this was too much i'll never forget 'tunnel' for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema shame it's such a low point
<START> really started the 80s trend of disgusting violence masquerading as a horror film i was the target audience for this repellent piece of trash and i was disgusted then as now br br oh where do we start let's see the setup you can bring people back to live if they died a violent death so that laughably weak premise is the excuse to butcher people in horrible ways because well that's needed to bring them back to life this might have worked if played over the top for black laughs a la re animator or something but no it's played straight there is a whole terrified family in a wagon that gets hunted down one of the few scenes at least where their demise is off screen however just about everything else is on screen there is actually a scene where a young girl walking along is beaten and killed by zombie townspeople who are all filming it and grinning with several cameras then there is a closeup of her face as the filmmakers lovingly and time consumingly reveal in time lapse photography her beaten face being carved down to a skull and rebuilt to look normal again this done of course by a slumming jack albertson as the mortician behind it all he likes to drive around in a ambulance hearse playing old tommy dorcey tunes i guess that is supposed to be cute br br in the end of course even the sheriff is undead and the doctor offers kindly to fix his rotting hands not clear why the sheriff is not out with the other townspeople killing children with glee and slicing their faces off sticking needles in burn victims eyes etc br br i wonder really wonder what people see in a geek show like this to give it any kind of rating at all it's not scary the twists are laughable and overall it's kind of sick it's not even well enough done to see it on a dare or enjoy on a level you might watch a bad hg lewis film it's just god awful trash made for people who get off on this type of pointless gore and made by people slumming for a paycheck br br sad that albertson was even involved
<START> to preface this review i must say that i was i suppose a little curious about this movie however i probably would not have seen it had i not had my arm slightly twisted br br in my opinion this movie shows just how depraved man can be in my eyes the worst thing about this whole springer phenomenon is not that type of people on the jerry springer show act as they do which in itself is eminently reproachable but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them and hear about their lives yes i suppose that includes me to whatever extent it is true if not glorifying that kind of behavior as some might say at the very least we may be subtly corrupting our minds and or desenstizing ourselves to this type of behavior br br but enough soapbox sort of here's the skinny the movie has an r rating and while it may deserve only that i did look away at some scenes so i'm not completely sure i feel that an nc 17 tip of the hat to the other reviewer might be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content a cynic might comment that the movie was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen the plot is very bizarre tying together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks upset who will appear on different springer shows at the end the movie leaves one with some resolvement and springer rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world evidently as seen through his show i agree with him there it is important to know how the world really is so that we can seek to effect positive change having said that let me just tell you the world's pretty bad glance in a newpaper or the news to see that but let's not shell out good money to support the kind of sensationalistic and perhaps formulaic titallition that springer seeks to give us
<START> office work especially in this era of computers multi functional copy machines e mail voice mail snail mail and temps ' is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers' and office space ' and very successfully this latest addition to the temp humor pool however haiku tunnel ' directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth fails to live up to it's predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar br br as the narrator star of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of san franc'l'isco ' it's an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny it is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isn't all that funny br br kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp ' it's a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob shelby warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d'amore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm ' the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position he's nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters he's typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on he's been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that something easy to do' in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him these are important' letters however and by the end of the week kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it kornbluth's days as the fair haired boy are going to be over and quick br br the brothers kornbluth who not only directed but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy where it says if you play it straight they will laugh ' but they didn't and the audience won't because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case plays' funny as in he knows' he's being funny he never is and that's exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being funny ' he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie br br in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn't work it comes down to two basic reasons the directing which if not necessarily bad' is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of josh kornbluth quite simply kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use self deprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it's easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly br br the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project br br shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth's performance if only momentarily but it's still not enough to save the day or the film br br the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he agreed to this ' in any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone's comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right haiku tunnel ' however will doubtfully remain very long amongst them for it's destiny lies elsewhere in a realm known only as obscurity ' i rate this one 1 10 br br br br
<START> a typical clausen film but then again not typical clausen writes directs and play one of the leading roles this is really a great film about normal people living normal lives trying to make the best of it the 4 primary actors were fantastic br br fritz helmut was convincing you believe that he really is sick br br sonja richter plays a nurse that really is an actor but it turns out that she is the best nurse to take care of the old man br br everybody has problems and those who nobody believes in ends up being happy but nothing good comes easy they have to fight to win their life and love
<START> these two men went thru hell and beyond and have produced the movie that conveys the terror that many did not survive this is definitely a movie about survival but not without it's touching moments br br the finest piece of work i have seen documenting the 9 11 01 tragedy of new york city
<START> this is not a boring movie the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character miles berkowitz both film maker and actor here the storyline is simple after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non career the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera the first question is about how true is all that what is written what came by chance both answers yes or no portrays m berkowitz as a low average human beeing if you look for a self fiction about love like this one i recommand you to read some independant comic books chester brown joe matt br br beside of this i felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country france i know american people usually say that the french are arrogant that might be true then etc and for sure the french and the whole world have lots of griefs against america but why so much hate don't think i couldn't like this movie only because of that anyhow
<START> by far the worst movie of all time even yaphet kotto could not save this turkey i have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled the treasure but was changed to sharks' treasure in order to take advantage of the excitement created by jaws i think sharks were in one scene of this movie the fact that they happened to be included in this thriller was supposed to sell tickets didn't work anytime something good happens in the movie the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made gee do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor could they have made it any more obvious the only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing that's cause enough for celebration
<START> tenchu aka hitokiri directed by hideo gosha starring shintaro katsu and tetsuya nakadei belongs together with goyokin hara kiri rebellion to the best chambara movies existing br br its the story about shintaro katsu who plays okada izo working for nakadei who wants to become the daymio okada being the cleaner for nakadei is being treated like a dog and after quite a while he realises what he realy is to nakadei br br but there is so much more in this movie every fan of japanese cinema should have seen it br br tenchu means heavens punishment
<START> i finally got myself set up on mail order dvd rental so i could find movies not available to me in the stores i chose the souler opposite because i love christopher meloni and also like small often ignored films br br this one is such a treat meloni has such charm in this part it's easy to pigeon hole him is you only ever see him as his alter ego elliot stabler losvu in this film meloni is an out of step unattached mid lifer who is hitting the skids in many ways only to find a path to happiness in someone unexpected br br the relationship drawn between barry meloni and tim busfield's character is realistic and not over done i haven't seen busfield since 30something and he was fun to watch but it was all chris' film i became such a fan girl all over again br br it is a bit slow in the beginning i will admit i thought some of the flashbacks could have been edited down but overall this film will delight you male or female as it has an honest refreshing view of relationships today
<START> i don't watch a lot of tv except for the office weeds entourage and e 's soup i think i hold this show in good company br br i love the scathing review of pop culture that this show gives soup also helps me stay on top of what people in the office are referring to when talking about a sanjaya or heidi montag sp br br the best part is that soup shows clips of the highlights of these shows which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments c'mon most people get hooked into watching american idol because of the freak show that are the auditions which is why most people claim to watch and that means i don't have to suffer through the other 98 of these mind numbing talk shows or reality shows for one nugget of funny or shock the only reason why soup doesn't get a 10 in my opinion are sometime the sketches are not that funny and on an even rarer occasion the commentary isn't always up to par but they can't all be home runs either if so soup wouldn't be on e br br joel's quick wit and soup's writing team which includes mchale make for a great show i happen to enjoy the laughing and comments from the crew who are off camera even when they're being blatantly obvious by giving occasional courtesy laughs it's hilarious because it is forced they're obviously being ironic and that's part of what makes this show funny
<START> so yes it is quite nostalgic watching the 1st episode because this is the one episode i definitely remembered i enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the action packed shows we have now this show seems lame but frankly i like the less violent part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones now i thought it interesting that belisario's airwolf and jag have similar theme the lead actor hawke and harm both are looking for an mia relative brother father wonder if robert belisario's personal life mimics these 2 shows' theme br br question does anyone have pictures of hawke's cabin i love that cabin kinda like a dream cabin of mine and that is one of the scenes i remember about airwolf
<START> i happen to be the director's nephew it's taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and i can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies of all time my uncle doesn't even have a copy of it anymore i asked i'm looking forward to bringing him a copy br br currently the film's average rating is 1 9 10 as far as i can tell that should put it somewhere in the mid 30s in the imdb bottom 100 however with only 206 votes it hasn't yet placed br br it's sad that the film doesn't even get the respect of a bottom 100 title br br anyhow i'm giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts best worst gift ever
<START> this film is regarded by some as a classic i've no idea why it is terrible to the point of being laughable the only saving grace with this movie are the delivery of cheesy lines that are so toe curlingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them br br there are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film but so what there is no plot it is set in a theatre with no change of scenery and michael douglas is as depressing as ever my brother once forced me to watch this film because he said i wouldn't believe how bad a film can get he was right br br normally with a film this dreadful i would recommend that people shouldn't watch it but in this case i think people should as it will put every other bad film you've seen in perspective
<START> i opted to see the film at the recent dubai film festival because it had been selected to the cannes film festival's prestigious competition section i was surprised that cannes could be so off the mark in judging quality br br the film some reviewers have noted does not have too much of gunfire but the inherent violence is repulsive imagine killing your enemy competitor in front of your young son or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty there are some hints of the contrasting corleone sons in copolla's godfather that seem to resurface here in this chinese hong kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and cheese br br this film is only recommended for violence junkies there is no great cinema here at best it might be considered to be better than the usual run run shaw production for production values
<START> the first time i saw this film i was in shock for days afterwards its painstaking and absorbing treatment of the subject holds the attention helped by good acting and some really intriguing music the ending quite simply had me gasping first rate
<START> too bad chuck norris has gone to tv he made some good movies before he hit tv this is a typical tv movie intended to pass the time unfortunately it wastes chuck's talent as an actor i hope he returns to the big screen some day
