<START> don't bother a little prosciutto could go a long way but all we get is pure ham particularly from dunaway the plot is one of those bumper car episodes the vehicle bounces into another and everything changes direction again until we are merely scratching our heads wondering if there were ever a plot gina phillips is actually good but it's hard playing across from a mystified dunaway playing lady macbeth lost in the marx's brother's duck soup ah the raven now there's an actor and there is the relative who just lies and bed and looks ghostly or dr dread who's filled with lots of gloom and no working remedies i'm one of those suckers who just has to see a movie to the end quoth the raven nevermore
<START> the author of numerous novels plays and short stories w somerset maugham 1874 1965 was considered among the world's great authors during his lifetime and although his reputation has faded over the years his work continues to command critical respect and a large reading public published in 1944 the razor's edge is the tale of a world war i veteran whose search for spiritual enlightenment flies in the face of shallow western values it was maugham's last major novel and it was immensely popular given that the novel's conflicts are internalized spiritual and philosophical issues it was also an extremely odd choice for a film version but darryl f zannuck of 20th century fox fell in love with the book and snapped up the screen rights shortly after publication br br according to film lore the razor's edge was to be directed by the legendary george cukor from a screenplay by maugham himself and it does seem that maugham wrote an adaptation when the film went into production however cukor was replaced by edmund goulding a director less known for artistic touch than a workman like manner and the maugham script was replaced with one by lamar trotti the author of such memorable screenplays as the oxbow incident tyrone power recently returned from military service during world war ii was cast as the spiritually conflicted larry darrell gene tierney one of the great beauties of her era was cast as socialite isabell bradley the supporting cast was particularly notable including herbert marshall anne baxter clifton webb lucille watson and elsa lanchester both budget and shooting schedule were lavish and when the film debuted in 1946 it was greatly admired by public and critics alike br br but time has a way of putting things into perspective seen today the razor's edge is indeed a beautifully produced film but that aside the absolute best one can say for it is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity as in most cases the major problem is the script although it is reasonably close to maugham's novel in terms of plot it is noticeably off the mark in terms of character and it completely fails to capture the fundamental issues that drive the story we are told that larry is in search of enlightenment we are told that he receives it we are told he acts on it but in spite of the occasional and largely superficial comment we are never really told anything about the spiritual artistic philosophical and intellectual processes behind any of it we are most particularly never told anything significant about the nature of the enlightenment itself it has the effect of cutting off the story at its knees br br we are left with the shell of maugham's plot which centers on the relationship between larry and isabell a woman larry loves but leaves due to the growing ideological riff that opens up between them tyrone power and gene tierney were more noted for physical beauty than talent but both could turn in good performances when they received solid directorial and script support unfortunately that does not happen here they are extremely one note and power is greatly miscast to boot fortunately the supporting cast is quite good with herbert marshall clifton webb and lucille watson particularly so the then famous performance by anne baxter however has not worn as well as one would hope br br with a running time of just under two and a half hours the film also feels unnecessarily long there is seemingly endless cocktail party type banter and indeed the entire india sequence which reads as faintly hilarious would have been better cut entirely an odd situation for this is the very sequence intended as the crux of the entire film regardless of the specific scene it all just seems to go on and on to no actual point br br as for the dvd itself the film has not been remastered but the print is extremely good and while the bonus package isn't particularly memorable neither is noticeably poor when all is said and done i give the razor's edge four stars for production values and everyone's willingness to take on the material but frankly this a film best left power and tierney fans who will enjoy it for the sake of the stars and those whose ideas about spiritual enlightenment are as vague as the film itself br br gft amazon reviewer
<START> it was no sense and it was so awful i think hollywood have a lot of film like that you don't have do watch it people cutter or eater what should i say it made me sick oh my god film is about people that we don't know but feed themselves with humans they have teeths bla bla bla isn't that familiar i can bet on it you saw it in a another movie the cast was so great but i think scenario was really awful and i should say that bradley cooper was totally awesome he's so talented actually i said awful but i think it because of horrible scenes let me explain it did you ever eat tongue but in the film one person did it it was really awful anyway i think film would so good without that awful human eater or cutter scenes
<START> this italian film from the '70's is not even in the class with dog soldiers the howling or even that awful american werewolf in paris but it is fun to watch i'm talking about watching the lead actress a stunning blonde run amok in her birthday suit we're talking about graphic complete nudity it's obvious that she is a real blonde humma humma humma the story is a hoot the sfx are childish and the acting for the most part stinks the only redeeming value of this movie is all and there is a lot the nudity sex scenes tame by hbo standards but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on saturday night ok here's the spoiler there is no werewolf except in the opening scene of the heroine 's ancestor the girl just imagines that she's a werewolf in other words a clinical lycanthrope
<START> what is very french about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters this might require a bit of patience especially since neither is attractive in the typical hollywood definition of such however once the heist kicks in the film rushes forward quickly perhaps at times too quickly but it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you don't look too closely it is all quite believable the kind of film that you know hollywood would have botched up
<START> steve carrel proves himself to be a great leading man in this wonderful original raunchy breath of fresh air i about wet myself at how geniusly hilarious it was br br basically the movie's title says it all andy stitzer is a 40 year old male who works at an electronics store he is a bit of a nerd who loves videogames and comics and has the biggest collection his peers that work in the store with him find out that he's a virgin during a rather sex dialogue filled poker game and then andy has to go through a rather funny as hell odyessy of rude sexual awakenings but always screwing up which leads to him not losing his virginity but he eventually gets lucky in the very end br br leave the little ones at home but take the entire family to see this awesome romantic adult comedy it will have you hooked and cracking up from the very beginning and by the time it is over you will be wishing you wore your extra thick absorbent undergarments only other thing i can say about it is too bad steve carrel wasn't recognized as a leaving man 20 years ago he is definitely gonna win best breakthrough male performance in next years mtv movie awards you can bet your hard earned dollar on that people br br i give this one a perfect 10
<START> okay i know this does'nt project india in a good light but the overall theme of the movie is not india it's shakti the power of a warlord and the power of a mother the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth then things go terribly wrong the interaction between nandini and her father in law the power of their dysfunctional relationship and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie shah rukh khan's performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor it is easy to get caught up in the love violence and redemption of lives in this film and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax the musical interludes are strengths believable and well done
<START> anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie film's protagonist a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet is jake a mesmerizing anthony demarco simply transferring the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image or could the creature be real writer director shelli ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing her choice of using one setting a suburban house adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobia br br brooke bloom and peter sean bridgers are highly convincing as the angry but loving parents however it is the creepy minor characters mrs bender barbara gruen an unhinged babysitter and sam stone ben bode a sleazy real estate agent that linger in the mind jake's closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell
<START> the last hunt is the forgotten hollywood classic western the theme of genocide via buffalo slaughter is present in other films but never so savagely robert taylor's against type role as the possessed buffalo and indian killer is his finest performance br br in the 1950s your mom dropped you and your friends off at the saterday matinÃ©e usually featuring a western or comedy but it was wrong then and now to let a youngster watch psycho dramas like the searchers and the last hunt let the kids wait a few years before exposing them to films with repressed sexual sadism and intense racial hatred br br why did mom fail to censor these films because they featured safe hollywood stars like taylor and john wayne but the climatic scene in the last hunt is as horrifying as vincent price's mutation in the fly br br the mythology of the white buffalo part of the texture of this movie was later ripped off by other movies including the white buffalo starring charles bronson as wild bill hickock the laugh here is that bronson used to play indians br br today a large remnant bison herd resides in yellowstone national park in wyoming in the winter hunger forces surplus animals out of the park into montana where they are sometimes harvested by idaho's nez perce indians under a us treaty right that pre dates the lincoln presidency linclon signed the congressional act which authorized the continental railroad and started the buffalo slaughter
<START> i love the depiction of the 30s and 40s in film i love salma hayek i was more than ready to love this picture but br br booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo br br no sir nothing good about this the only entertaining aspect for me was colin farrell's character is an insecure writer and this screenplay despite tackling the juicy subject of racism approaches the audience in the fashion of an abc afterschool special br br the only person who didn't sound like he was acting' was sutherland and his minutes were few br br stale approach to a tired plot
<START> losing control is another offering in the erotic thriller genre which could be considered as the pulp fiction of the film world usually they involve a roundabout route to murderous intent interspersed with copious disrobing this is not a complaint especially when it is done by the stunningly beautiful women who invariably inhabit this make believe world br br kim ward kira reed is suffering a bout of writer's block just by chance or is it she meets a man doug jeffery who engages with her in ever more risky sexual encounters the man refuses to divulge any information about himself yet kim steadfastly refuses to stop the affair her agent alexa anneliza scott thinks it will do wonders for her book sales as in most films of this type the denouement comes near the end but some things do not add up i have seen enough of this kind of film to think no change there then but i like them they are so undemanding br br performances of the cast vary doug jeffery carries the film as the psycho sociopath you do not want to cross kira reed looks good but fails to convince as the woman in peril clay greenbush as the pi did not convince either br br finally a note of caution about the dvd under review both the cover and the disc state r rated and running time as 93 minutes but the run time is less than 86 minutes this probably explains why the sex scenes appear truncated and why jennifer ludlow's performance is cut short just as she's getting started 4 stars
<START> possibly the most brilliant thing about che part two as we begin to integrate it with part one in our minds is that there is no clarification of why che chose to confidentially abscond from cuba after the revolution no allusion to his experience in the congo no clarification of why he chose bolivia as his subsequent setting for a coup d'etat no allusion to the political decisions he made as a young man motorcycling across south america which walter salles has given prominent familiarity extraordinary focus is given to che meeting the volunteers who accompany his guerrilla factions yet hardly any endeavor is made to single them out as individuals to establish involved relationships he is reasonably unreasonable che drives an unbreakable doctrine to leave no wounded man behind but there is no feeling that he is deeply directly concerned with his men it is the concept br br in part 1 in cuba the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages given food and cover supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution here in bolivia not much understanding is apparent villagers expose him they protect government troops not his own when he expounds on the onesidedness of the government medical system his audience appears uninterested you cannot lead a people into revolution if they do not want to comply soderbergh shows u s military advisers working with the bolivians but doesn't fault the united states for che's collapse che seems to have just misfigured his fight and the place where he wanted to have it br br in showcasing both wars soderbergh doesn't build his battle scenes as actions with specific results che's men attack and are attacked they exchange fire with faraway assailants there is generally a cut to the group in the aftershock of combat its death toll not paused for this is not a war movie it is about one man's reasonably unreasonable drive to endure there is no elaborate cinematography soderbergh looks firmly at che's inflexible dedication there are remarkable sporadic visceral shots but being few they are all the more powerful such as che's pov shot during his final beats there is an abundance of the terrain where these men live for weeks at a time and the all consuming effect is of languor guevara himself having malaria part of the time br br benicio del toro one of the film's producers gives a champion's performance not least because it's modest he isn't portrayed as the cutting edge like most epic heroes in cuba he arises in conquest in bolivia he falls to the reverse and occasionally is actually difficult to distinguish behind a tangle of beard and hair del toro illustrates not so much an identity as an attitude you may think the film is too long i think there's a genuine cause for its breadth guevara's affairs in cuba and particularly bolivia was not a sequence of episodes and sketches but an undertaking of staying power that might virtually be called insane in the end che as a whole or in parts is a commercially ballsy movie one where its director begins by understanding the limits innate in cinematic biography and working progressively within those means
<START> i like animated shows i enjoy the nick fare pretty much including hey arnold but moving a tv show to the big screen isn't easy and this just didn't feel big enough it was more like a long episode of the show and it just didn't move along that well judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us it didn't score that well with them either
<START> this short spoof can be found on elite's millennium edition dvd of night of the living dead good thing to as i would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper in execution it's a different matter this short didn't even elicit a chuckle from me i really never thought i'd say this but night of the day of the dawn of the son of the bride of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of the evil mutant alien flesh eating hellbound zombified living dead part 2 in shocking 2 d was a very better parody and not nearly as lame or boring br br my grade f
<START> rock n' roll is a messy business and dig demonstrates this masterfully a project of serious ambition and perhaps foolhardiness the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups with that said the abundance of quality material ensures the film's ability to captivate the audience if you've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry this movie will undoubtedly be an arresting viewing the music in the film although it suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting is worth the price of admission alone the morning after i saw dig i went straight to the record store to pick up a brian jonestown massacre album i was already initiated to the dandy warhols' sounds primarily defined by its exploration of rock music the film succeeds at other profound levels dig is a sincere and sufficiently objective glance into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people that try to wrangle those forces
<START> i liked the movie a real lot wanted to see it just for dara tomanovich but the plot and story were ok too a very cool change in plot when you least expect it
<START> playwright sidney bruhl a wonderfully over the top michael caine would kill for a hit play enter young wonder kid a solid reeve who's just written such a play weave into this bruhl's overly hysterical wife superbly played by cannon and a german psychic a very funny irene worth and you've got yourself a wonderfully funny suspense flick br br while not up to sleuth standards deathtrap is none the less a very capable twist filled comical suspense ride based on a terrific play by ira levin the performers are obviously having a field day with the material with caine in particular delivering top notch lines with gusto br br the film loses a bit of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall deathtrap is solid well acted and suspenseful fun
<START> preston waters a 11 years old boy has problems with his parents and brothers specially because of money issues he is crazy to have his own house and his own rules since his brothers always stole his saved money and his parents neglect his wishes one awful day preston was riding his bicycle it was the same day that the villain of the story quigley was trying to scape from the police and accidentally ran the car over preston's bike needing to be far away from the police quigley gives in a hurry a check to cover the damages of preston's bike the problem was it was a blank check preston is a clever boy and decides to have a high price on that check 1 million dollars all that money gives preston things that he always wished for like a mansion with pool lots of toys and even a limousine the problems start to begin when the fbi and quigley wants to know where the money is making preston in a hard situation and facing many problems br br this movie was one of my favorites during my childhood
<START> when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay speaking of gameplay the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you
<START> gwyneth paltrow is absolutely great in this movie but the story is unfortunately half baked and david schwimmer's energy is sort of like cold mush when he closes his mouth and gets serious for a moment or two there is a rush of what might have been who thought 25 year old kiddies would be entertaining
