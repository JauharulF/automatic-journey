<START> the title alone along with the poster is enough to give away the projected man as an obvious rip off of the fly and bryant haliday while much better than the typical imdb review would have you think is nobody's idea of an acceptable stand in for vincent price although come to think of it who would be unless micheal gough was available still if you are in the mood to watch a british hammer style movie with a science fiction theme about a teleportation experiment gone horribly wrong well you still might want to give the projected man a pass and rummage around in the 'remaindered' bin at your local wal mart for another teleporter accident movie because this one just isn't all that good br br haliday caught a lot of good natured ribbing from the mst3k crew for his part in this movie and in devil doll but he is actually the best thing in tpm maybe he can't carry the movie but he gets practically no help here from the screenplay the script bogs down any forward momentum the plot may have in a mire of nonsense about funding and university politics and a guy named lembach and some sinister cabal who want the teleportation machine to fail so they can steal its secrets or something so all the dramatic sequences in the first half of movie involve either phone calls or unconvincing special effects with transparent espresso machines and teleporting rats then when poor haliday gets mutilated by his machine he has to spend the last part of the film wearing a diaper over half his face and rubber cement over the rest while he electrocutes various londoners who chance across his path tom cruise and eric roberts using bullhorns couldn't have made this screenplay work br br meanwhile all the other actors diligently try to inject life and interest into their roles for this turgid little project but the screenplay just swallows their efforts whole the corrupt project administrator frets and fumes and hisses into the phone to his blackmailers all the while failing to notice that he looks like a werewolf outfitted in a tweed suit and a tattersall vest haliday's research assistant and ex girlfriend have the least convincing romance in the history of british horror cinema his secretary is forced to parade around in her smalls none of it really works or gels into a real movie and it all just kind of stops dead leaving the viewer going eh excuse me wasn't there supposed to be an ending here br br still for all its problems i can easily name a dozen horror movies from the same period that were as bad or worse and so could anyone else who follows movies or who has ever browsed the imdb bottom 100 i wouldn't actually pay money to own projected man but if it were included in some compilation along with a dozen other movies in a dvd collection i'd probably feel ok about having it it's a harmless diversion perfect for a horror movie film festival to watched with friends while consuming many beers and snacks on a saturday evening
<START> mirage 1990 is a very rare horror chiller from 1990 released here in the uk on the new world video label br br it's a desert based horror film about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend only to be killed off one by one by an unknown force who drives a menacing black truck this film has some creepy scenes and some gore here and there but i have to say that the acting was so lame even by low budget standards but the film was oddly addictive and i liked it and i never fell asleep or turned it off which is always a good sign i nearly gave this movie 6 10 but seeing as it built up steam along the way had some good moments of gore and suspense had some good nudity and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was a hottie too i'll give it 7 10
<START> dr mccoy and mr spock find themselves trapped in a planet's past ice age while capt kirk is in the same planet's colonial period however it's the former pair that has the most trying time besides the freezing temperatures and sanctuary to be found only in caves there is a third inhabitant the beautiful and so sexy zarabeth mariette hartley as spock spends more time in this era he slowly begins to revert to the behavioral patterns of his ancestors feeling a natural attraction to zarabeth and throwing caution to the wind about ever leaving this place only with dr mccoy's constant reminders does spock hold on to some grasp of reality br br this stand as one of the few times when the character gets to show some emotion and nimoy spock plays it to the hilt coming close to knocking the bejesus out of deforest kelly mccoy surprising to previous installment captain kirk william shatner wasn't allowed to get the girl another plus for this one br br perennial old man ian wolfe assays the role of mr atoz the librarian responsible for sending the trio into the past
<START> this movie begins with an ordinary funeral and it insists so hard on this ordinary funeral feel that i lost interest within 5 minutes of watching and started skipping scenes it seems to me whomever made this movie is afflicted to the extent of becoming trapped in a permanent morbid trance unable to contemplate anything else but death and destruction well i ain't one of the dark kids from southpark i want a movie that within 10 minutes gets me well into an interesting story i won't sit and watch 10 minutes of nothing but preparations for a funeral my grandma on her last years was fascinated by funerals perhaps she might have enjoyed this movie
<START> this film is absolutely horrific one of the worst movies i've ever seen the story does nearly not exist the characters are full of stereotypes and the special fx only make you laugh the only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the rapper coolio as some kind of police officer br br if this film was supposed to be a comedy i didn't quite get the point if you want to watch this movie please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs especially when the first special fx appear on the screen br br but if you like trash movies made on the cheap this film is a must see for you
<START> i gave this two stars for the awesome dv shot clarity which lends to the cold and dark sterility of its character that was being generous i know br br this film fails on all accounts i can not recommend this for it is neither poetic nor blunt neither dramatic nor suspenseful neither controversial nor ordinary it is just a wretched piece of trash that no horror or exploit fan can recommend in good faith br br do not watch this whoever you are please just stay away from this awful product br br thank you
<START> let me start by saying that i consider myself to be one of the more most open minded movie viewers movies are my passion and i am a big regular at my local cult movie rental place i also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice about movies whenever i get there and i never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what is going on in the cult movie area i love to rent strange stuff and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult movie video place he told me he thought i had to see this and since the cover said something about it being a movie with a jodorowsky one of my favorites atmosphere i rented it br br the vote i gave here is not really fair because i did not think it was awful i just did not know how to rate it otherwise a question mark would have been more appropriate br br this is the first and only film that literally made me sick to my stomach i actually felt physically ill am i the only one whose stomach literally turned still i did not want to turn it off or maybe i just couldn't because i was fascinated in a nasty way br br i do not ever wanna see this movie again br br not awful a 1 as i said just not my cup of tea or wodka for that matter
<START> i've always knew anne desalvo was a great character actor now i know she is a great writer director also i have been a fan since i first saw her in the movies perfect my favorite year dc cab and stardust memories br br it's so rare to see lee grant these days in anything she has been missing from the screen for far too long it's also wonderful to see cloris leachman in something other than a sit com this is her best work since the last picture show if you grew up in an italian american family you will love this movie i wasn't expecting a lot when i started watching this movie so i was pleasantly surprised when i fell in love with this movie if you get the chance watch it
<START> this movie rivals plan 9 as one of the dumbest movie ever made always be concerned when the same person is the br br 1 star 2 director 3 producer 4 writer 5 stuntman and 6 editor unfortunately justin kreinbrink did all 6 jobs imdb shows that he and his father were western 'stunt men' so maybe that was the problem br br here's just one example from the film in the film the sheriff has to take a witness to another town for protection of course the bad guys find out and are waiting for them but what happens the good guys are riding along and a shot rings out and hits a tree near them when the camera shows us the bad guys they're all just sitting on a log chatting what's wrong with this picture br br i could go on perhaps this film was meant as a comedy if so it didn't do that well either
<START> space camp is a pretty decent film the plot is predictable but the actors do a good job and the special effects are decent for the time br br this film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster and that really put a hamper on how popular it was br br the scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular on the big screen that is on a tv it just looks average i remember this scene in the theater it made you feel like you were really up there br br this would be a good film to see on imax but i'm sure that will never happen
<START> eytan fox did it again move the viewer's heart in a modest story taking place in an overwhelming mess the movie also succeeds in describing so perfectly and subtly the atmosphere of the incredible city that is tel aviv br br i was there a month ago and it is all there the lifestyle the relationships the heart beating city the mess the chock of utopian mindsets in the most light hearted blithe and oblivious megalopolis ever br br strongly recommend it is a voyage for the heart and the mind with an interesting perspective to the israelo palestinian conflict br br nota bene there is central gay plot in the movie if you do not think you are too gay friendly be prepared to be challenged and finally see it as just love and don't worry the chick is hot too
<START> ever since the cinema loving universe made acquaintance with a guy named george a romero the word zombie automatically gets associated with blood soaked horror images and non stop acting sequences it's safe to say that his night of the living dead formed the zombie movie as we know it now yet in the earliest years of cinema the premise of reanimated corpses was merely used in slow nearly action less psychological thrillers jacques tourneur's i walked with a zombie is a perfect example and so is white zombie starring bela lugosi this revolt of the zombies could have been another example but unfortunately it's a failure over the entire line and easily one of the most tedious movies i ever saw dreadful acting a very poorly written screenplay and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension the film only lasts 65 minutes and yet the first half hour is entirely wasted on stupid love story intrigues and unexciting monologues the setting in the legendary cambodian city of angkor surely could have resulted in a more compelling story but all we ever see are interior shots the lead actress dorothy stone textbook blonde with curly hair and an ugly nose irritated me enormously and i kept hoping a ravenous undead would suddenly appear out of nowhere to devour her unlucky againÂ if you manage to struggle yourself through 60 soporific minutes you'll be rewarded with a fairly decent finale still this is far too little to give this film a positive rating let alone a recommendation avoid this is the type of movie you should only see in case you already saw everything else
<START> what happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers the premise may sound familiar the watchmen unbreakable however the russian sci fi action flick the sword bearer is far from the standard stock br br the story revolves around a man named sasha who as a boy was shunned from society his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess when he wishes or his anger allows a sword extends from his arm piercing his own skin very wolverinish maybe but that's not the interesting part of this film shunned all his life and driven by anger and a temper he does have our hero returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to the only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old flame's new boyfriend leaves him bloodied on the ground this is where the vengeance and anger comes into play this is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail he meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about br br the film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences this is art house at it's core beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci fi action it's this odd mash that interests me so much in this film the directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of sasha and not a straight action film don't worry though the action is there and plenty of it however much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath this is not to say that action is not shown these scenes are here and are fantastic especially the ending where we see sasha's full powers unleashed in desperation the director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the character's emotional struggle at hand this is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre
<START> this hal roach comedy short a tough winter is the ninety ninth in the our gang little rascals series and the eleventh talkie bascally a showcase for black comic stepin fetchit who gets special billing here we see him going to his shack where the gang hangs out farina retrieves a love letter from the mail for him and is told by stepin to read it since he can't read it during the day as he goes to night school it happens to be from his sweetheart in tennesse so now farina has to have his ears stuffed with cotton since it's too hot for him to hear in another room weezer relays instructions to mary ann of making taffy from the radio but because he keeps running back and forth to the kitchen he misses the lady announcer's segue to rice pudding and spanish tamale confusing mary ann with additions of tabasco and lux after the concoction is completed jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with the awful tasting but very sticky substance as everyone gets stuck on the walls as a result as they all try to clean the mess stepin works in the basement on various pipes and electrical outlets that mixes variable appliances' functions such a telephone that vacuums a vacuum that rings and a refrigerator that plays music the end what i've just described portends the meandering nature of this our gang short that served as the pilot for a potential stepin fetchit movie short series it's just as well that it never took place as fetchit's characterization of the lazy negro was amusing only in small doses and would be considered highly offensive today many of the scenes i've just described are good for some laughs though the final sequence was so confusing that the results were just too blah for me so in summary a tough winter is a curio worth seeing at least once by the way stepin's real name was lincoln theodore perry
<START> bad acting bad southern accents inconsistent cinematography horrible script br br i was looking forward to this film at a recent film festival and was so discouraged after seeing it it contains quote unquote name talent but they do not deliver of course the basis for this is the uneven and uninteresting story that is told br br don't bother
<START> after the opening credits there's a black screen for about a minute a minute of nothing then a girl wakes up and takes a shower then her and two college friends are driving to a rock concert after much padding they hit something and skid off the road they awaken in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair bound old lady and her offspring the killings are sadly very tame for a supposed video nasty the twist ending silly and predictable no one involved in the mess would ever make anything of note again so there are still happy endings sometimes br br eye candy sara ansley gets topless and laurel munson has full frontal on display br br my grade d
<START> after 30 seconds you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap knock off the story is taken from great movies like texas chainsaw massacre and hills have eyes i like those kind of movies even if they're duplicated well wrong turn timber falls carver br br but side sho is hard to watch the actors are really bad the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and totally misplaced you do not care at all what happens to the characters the so called bad guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical so how about the blood and gore well there is some although it is rather cheap and the action is executed very poorly 2 points just for the gore and blood but do understand that this is hardly worth a look even for the gore hounds
<START> if you want just about everything you want to know about wwii from multiple perspectives this dvd delivers you will learn new things guaranteed so much so that you won't need any other documentary's on the subject get this watch it learn from it good for school use as well as a bonus watch this with tora tora tora saving private ryan patton band of brothers a bridge too far the longest day and other wwii epics along with this to make your knowledge of wwii even more complete sir laurence oliver's voice adds to the overall atmosphere of each episode in this 26 part series seriously you won't find a better wwii documentary set on the subject perfect 10
<START> this movie surprised me not ever having heard of hyde of gackt i was not expecting much the reason i wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in john woo style normally i am very careful when this is claimed there is only one john woo and til this day there hasn't been one director that comes close to his brilliance when it comes to action the fact that moon child would feature a vampire convinced me even more how can you go wrong with gun blazing vampires sounds promising and interesting the first thing i noticed about this movie that the pace was considerably slow it takes it's time to set the mood this movie contains some nice hong kong style action scenes but moon child isn't an action movie it is a drama about friendship and loyalty the focus is on the characters and their relation to each other the pop singers hyde and gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends the only problem i had was with the plot a couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip example when one member of the gang dies very dramatic moment alexander wang sees kei hyde drinking blood of one of the attackers without warning and explanation the movie skips 9 nine years and most of the friends aren't together anymore also without a proper reason given son alexander wang and sho gackt have to kill each other i know that this is done to add some serious drama because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it does feel forced apart from the flaws in plot this movie has an ambiance and slickness that makes it hard not to like this movie it is hard to explain why this movie is wonderful but it just is the overall experience you get is heartwarming and sincere
<START> who actually created this piece of crap this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is such a waste of time and money i hate it how they create low budget sequels featuring d lister actors and a storyline so similar to the 1st one br br i found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to wild things 2 and death to the supermodels for 2 99 what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the 1st one br br whoever thought that this straight to video production was actually even a half decent film you must be on crackd or something because i think what pretty much most of the people who've seen this film thinks what a load of crap
