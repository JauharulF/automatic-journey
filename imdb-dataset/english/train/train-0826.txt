<START> when a comedy movie boasts its marvelous soundtrack on the back cover you know your not dealing with a top notch movie i rented this movie with friends expecting to get some chuckles but overall to get most of our laughs off each other making fun of the movie we couldn't have chosen a worse movie br br the movie may have been alright with a few changes first off the comedy was painful physical gags were poorly performed and placed the fat kid in the movie made us want to kill ourselves bless him for trying scene in and scene out but he was like a puppy begging for love if he had been pulled from the movie everything might have been bearable there were some funny jokes i believe one was when the group of boys steal one of the parent's porn movies and it turns out to be gay porn but to best sum up the comedy i will simply tell the opening gag for the fat kid he wears a puke stained shirt and talks about not knowing when something is done br br to finish off the editor of the movie could have saved the movie by removing the fat kid cutting out 20 minutes of the school scenes and making an ending that is longer than thirty seconds of random bickering br br oh btw there are two good elements that the movie possesses kadeem hardison plays his role wonderfully and performs his jokes so that none are missed or under appreciated the other redeeming element to the movie is the beautiful mrs ali landry her character is ignored most of the movie which is a shame br br don't waste your time even renting this one it didn't appeal to me and i was part of the target audience 18 male
<START> what does the executive producer do in a movie if i remember correctly it's the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie you might notice in a great number of movies starring sean connery that he is also the executive producer which meant connery himself raised the money since he is a major player unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies starring sean connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he's a major hollywood player it's usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story screenplay not being up to scratch br br protocol follows the saga of one sunny davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat likely as things progress ms davis who has problems being able to string two sentences together finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations when i say that protocol stars goldie hawn who is also the film's executive producer do you understand what i'm saying about the story screenplay not being up to scratch exactly
<START> dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt one of the most amazing shows ever produced but not just in the field of animation while the first part acts 1 and 2 mostly consists of action and fun the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part acts 3 and 4 i do have some complaints though in the first part the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool buaku rules
<START> this is the kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine the fire on and with your feet up it doesn't require that much brain power to follow so is very good after a long day i would say it is very unrealistic if you expecting anything serious then don't bother but it is very funny just the thought that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in a slum for a while and then actually get to enjoy it i would definitely recommend it
<START> the master blackmailer based off of sir arthur conan doyle's short story the adventure of charles augustus milverton is the first feature length sherlock holmes story with jeremy brett that i have seen the story is interesting and dark the film has a somewhat dreary sad feel to it but it is quite entertaining with some especially funny scenes br br spoilers sherlock holmes and dr watson attempt to uncover the identity of an illusive blackmailer who has been ruining some of the most prominent families of england by publishing private letters that will in one way or another destroy their lives they eventually find out that he is charles augustus milverton an art dealer after the few tragic consequences for victims that could not pay up our heroes must next help lady eva blackwell who must pay a sum that is beyond her means or else her upcoming marriage will most definitely be called off the scene in which holmes and watson burglarize milverton's house are intense although the film has an essentially happy ending the tone is sad and regretful br br outstanding performances by jeremy brett and edward hardwicke as usual and robert hardy as the notorious villain most audiences probably recognize him today as cornelius fudge in harry potter serena gordon as lady eva blackwell norma west as lady swinstead and sophie thomson as agatha the scenes involving her and holmes are a riot i give it a 1 2 out my only complaint is that there wasn't enough inspector lestrade i wish they would have added in the scene at the end of the short story where he gives the description of the two burglars one of which matches watson
<START> the effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who becomes involved with con artists is so mannered that i have to assume that that was the desired intent the sets are artificial and at no time did i not feel that i was watching a movie it seemed like the actors were just reading their lines rather than responding to one another while the film has elements of early film noir except that it is in color the approach is so exaggerated that i almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre br br given that the presentation had no appeal to me i was at least expecting an engaging story usually i am pretty slow on the uptake when it comes to stories with plot twists but you could see what was coming here within the first fifteen minutes by the time of the gee i forgot the 80 000 moment i thought to myself that this thing is truly ridiculous for a psychiatrist with stated experience in gambling addictions to behave so stupidly is beyond belief if at any stage she had behaved like a normal intelligent person the whole story would have fallen apart br br this wooden production left me cold
<START> fashionably fragmented yet infuriatingly half realized character study an examination of the different personalities of two college roommates a talented but undisciplined star basketball player and a pot smoking womanizing rabble rouser we never learn why these young men are friends they may share confusions about the world and their places in it but they don't seem to have anything else in common making his directorial debut jack nicholson who also co wrote the screenplay with jeremy larner based upon larner's book doesn't introduce us to the characters with any clarity nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen there are some very decent performances here particularly from newcomer william tepper in the central role but most of the picture is unformed perhaps intentionally sketchy or unsure bruce dern plays the hard driving basketball coach karen black is the older married lady tepper is having an affair with and michael margotta is tepper's wayward friend in an off putting over the top performance nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor preferring i assume to let the character interaction dominate the film's tone his script is no help either and as a result it is unclear whom we're supposed to sympathize with small random moments do work a supermarket fight between tepper and black dern visiting tepper in his dorm room all of the scenes set on the court however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess hoping to juxtapose an all important b ball game with a sexual assault nicholson shows no style at his craft nor does he earn points for chutzpah as his staging of these events is squashy and ugly when a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors one has to question his motives in doing so perhaps if drive he said ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste unfortunately the perplexing closer is as dumbfounding as much of the rest of the movie 1 2 from
<START> i last read a nancy drew book about 20 years ago so much of my memory of the fictional character is probably faulty from what i gathered the books were introduced to me at an era when teenage sleuths were popular to children growing up at the time for my case the 80s and early 90s with hardy boys famous five and of course carolyn keene 's nancy drew amongst the more famous ones i still remember those hardcover books with very dated cover illustrations usually quite heavy for a kid to lug around and the thickness of the book perhaps attributed to the fact that the words are printed in large fonts br br well the character has been given some updates along the way as i recall my sister's subsequent nancy drew books becoming less thick of softcover with updated and a more chic nancy illustrated on the cover i can't remember if those stories were the same as the old hardcover ones but i guess these books being ghostwritten have their fair share of updating itself for the times br br in this warner brothers release of nancy drew the character no doubt gets its update to suit the times but somehow the writers andrew fleming and tiffany paulsen maintained her 50s ish small town sensibilities thereby retaining some charm and flavour that erm folks like me would appreciate her fashion sense her prim and properness even some quirky little behaviour traits that makes her well nancy drew br br her family background remains more or less the same living with her single parent father carson drew tate donovan who is moving his daughter and himself to the big city for a better job opportunity and to wean his daughter off sleuthing in the town of river heights mom is but a distant memory and the housemaid makes a cameo but what made nancy drew work is the casting of emma roberts in the lead role niece of her famous aunt julia she too possess that sprightly demeanour that unmistakable red hair and that megawatt smile her nancy drew while in the beginning does seem to rub you the wrong way actually will grow on you and in almost what i thought could be a discarded scene from pretty woman it had the characters walk into a classy shop with almost opposite reactions br br while dad carson drew tries hard to bring nancy out of her sleuthing environment and to assimilate into normal teenage life trust nancy to find themselves living in a house whose owner a hollywood type has been was found murdered under suspicious circumstances mystery solving is her comfort food when she finds herself an outcast of the local fraternity and not before long we're whisked off along with her on her big screen adventure br br there's nothing too black dahlia about the crime and mystery and instead it's a pretty straightforward piece for nancy to solve in between befriending corky josh flitter a chubby friend from school and pacifying jealous boyfriend ned max thieriot while hiding the truth of her extra curriculum activities from her dad the story's laced with cheesy fun and an oldie sentimentality which charms and together it becomes somewhat scooby doo like with minimal violence and no big bag gunfights or explosions this is seriously a genre which is labelled clearly with chick flick alert br br i guess the movie will generate a new generation of fans rekindle the memories of old ones and probably just probably might spark a new fashion trend of sporting penny loafers
<START> one of the most nihilistic and brutal films i've ever seen but also one of the most tragic and moving ones this is an action melodrama like the world has never seen it before sometimes the plot got me close to tears while in the next moment delivering shocking revelations like a bone crunching blow to the guts chilling performance by edison chen the story of a hk cop and a cambodian killer hunting each other down while bit by bit losing their humanity is a strong one featuring very little dialog in favor of haunting imagery and gritty camera work dog bite dog is pure hk bloodshed without the heroism
<START> i must confess that i was completely shocked by this film for one i went to see it on a whim expecting something mediocre but given this the most shocking thing was that this was in a populist american cinema at all this is british comedy at its finest dark quirky and funny in ways that american films just never are i must stop short however of recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone i went to see it with several people some english some european and some american and while some of us loved it mainly from the first two groups some hated it and found it worthless if you think you're into this kind of thing then go if not don't 10 10
<START> the emotional impact of this movie defies words it is elegant subtle beautiful and tragic all rolled into two hours this is will smith as he matures into his acting ability the full range of it who knew i saw the pursuit of happiness and thought this must be a fluke for the blockbuster over the top actor smith his performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to smith a refinement of talent the selectivity of scripts i'm not sure but i view him differently now seven pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief don't watch it for the plot watch it for the fragile condition of the human heart both literally and metaphorically it is a story of human guilt atonement love and sacrifice
<START> the second half of steven soderbergh's revolutionary bio on che guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to bolivia in order to maintain his saintly visage of che soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in cuba and the folly of his congo adventure this is the history of a failure he writes in the preface of his congo journal to concentrate fully on che's attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in bolivia it would turn out to be a disaster and guevara's final act br br what plagued the first chapter follows suit here as soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative guevara once again being played like james dean in east of eden by bernicio del toro the problem is guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness bolivian jungle unlike werner herzog in the magnificent aguirre the wrath of god soderbergh fails to utilize the jungle's metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas he seems more concerned with keeping che's nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders there is one herzogian moment where che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall soderbergh's mise en scene remains flat sloppy and uninteresting br br in both of his films soderbergh shows he is clearly a che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow he spends too much time building his monument to che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga especially fidel castro making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire one would think he was steeped in enough eisenstein and vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping style
<START> the reasons to watch this knock off err tribute to a great movie called se7en it's on while your channel surfing and there's nothing else on someone pays you to watch it br br do yourself a favor and pop in the dvd for se7en rent it download it on itunes or put it in your netflix cue and skip the flock entirely the flock the same story with with a few changes furthermore the editing just wreaks of se7en and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times the worst one is probably the fly over desert helicopter shots with sounds of people people chattering over the radio except there are no police helicopters flying overhead in this one br br bottom line i call it a blatant knock off if you wanna be nice you can call it a tribute film go ahead but either way go watch se7en
<START> mat spirogolou's toby malone family know he is a talented footballer and are pleased when he secures an audition to join a big club they hope that when he arrives in the city his cousin will look after him br br but the cousins are like chalk and cheese one a naive farm boy the other a streetwise spendthrift who has managed to get mixed up with drug dealers and gangsters mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day br br having missed his cousin george damien robertson on arrival in the city mat encounters further trouble when a young biker takes him for a ride in more ways than one br br toby malone probably better known for his work in theatre puts in a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager there are telltale signs of a low budget but as with so many other low budget movies there's more fun seemingly more spontaneity and more charm than there is to be seen in the average hollywood blockbuster
<START> this film is overblown predictable pretentious and hollow to its core the settings are faithful to the era but self conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure the lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue tom hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as bruce willis did in hart's war tom you can't give depth to a character simply by making your face blank the content did not warrant the histrionic acting by paul newman this is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing
<START> there are lots of extremely good looking people in this movie that's probably the best thing about it perhaps that even makes it worth watching br br loaded tells the story of tristan price jesse metcalfe a young man who's about to make his mark on the world he's the son of a well to do family with a good reputation and he's on his way to law school but like so many such settings things aren't quite as perfect as they appear the expectations in this family far outweigh the love except for school tristan's father rarely lets him leave the house this seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isn't spelled out until the very end tristan's claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation the celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party and from there tristan befriends sebastian cole corey large who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld br br while technically well made this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isn't very engaging also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out of place such as slow motion fast motion freeze frames and echos these are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a character's perspective while on drugs except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points in some cheap attempt at style br br despite its cast of relative unknowns performances were good all around most notably with respect to the main antagonist corey large i suspect we'll be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future br br of course when mentioning the actors i must mention their looks rating based on hotness this movies scores an 11 the women in this movie are incredible looking and almost distract you from what a boring movie you're watching i'm sure the male characters are also quite attractive but you'll have to ask someone else to comment on that br br overall i can't recommend this movie not for buying renting or even seeing for free it's unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through
<START> this is not as funny and gory as the dvd box claims i really love twisted and wierd movies but this one is really just dull it's one hour of ripped off penises flying baby born dolls and a lot of rape i think the intention with this amateur sleaze was to make a it's so bad it's good movies but it fails it's just bad a few scenes are ok but in whole it's a mess if you like amateur splatter like this one only way better i would recommend andreas schnass' violent shit 2 and 3
<START> beyond the excellent direction production acting the predictable drama lies an essential message in the script br br listening leads all the way in order for the voice to flourish listen to harmonise with other in voice listen in order to approach yourself listen to discover the needs of any situation or others listen it appears that the script writers are conveying a life's secret listening leads to an awareness of one's self it awakens the other senses especially vision expands the horizon one's soul too can be discovered the artistry of this movie as it is in heaven magnificently displayed the unfolding of life not only its joy sadness but ultimately the hope of life all this by the leading character's first instruction to the choir br br just listen it leads all the way
