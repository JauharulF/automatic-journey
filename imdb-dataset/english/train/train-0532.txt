<START> i swear that zombie was killed like twice and kept coming back i gave this movie an 8 let's face it folks this is exactly what the other reviewers are saying i e a handy cam shot film hey hey hey welcome to total indy film making the fact that todd sheets got over 700 zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents yes the story has gaps yes we see the same zombies over and over again but who really cares take it for what it is a fun and gory horror film one to share with your buds or to gross out the people you really care about lol mellow out people i suppose you all liked hunks of garbage like titanic or twister instead peace and support independent film making
<START> now i'm no film critic but i truly hated september 11 this film was on a general basis bad with the exception of alejandro gonzÃ¡lez iÃ±Ã¡rritu's segment which was the most effective and direct about the subject matter the short films were at best boring and at worst offensive the worst in my mind was youssef chahine's pretentious segment in which he compared palestinian suicide bombers to american soldiers even going so far as to suggest the suicide bombers were fighting for a greater cause the segment was completely off topic and considering chahine's seeming lack of any decency whatsoever a waste of my time and patience the idea of getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie featuring their views on a tragedy was good on paper but in practice it was tasteless
<START> this movie has one of the cheesiest plots i have seen for me that's what makes it so awesome fred gwynne and al lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original munsters series while there was less slapstick they still worked wonderfully together comedically i wish yvonne de carlo as lily would have had more plot involvement she showed that she could do comedy in the original series but it was mostly wasted in this movie this movie also stars the great sid caesar but sadly he doesn't have any interaction with gwynne and lewis i think some better work could have come out of that
<START> i love b movies but come on this wasn't even worth a grade the ending was dumb b c there was no real ending not to mention that it comes to life on its own i mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a 15 min time period and i won't even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its head and then you don't even get to see what jigsaw even does with his so called new jigsaw puzzle unless you have nothing better to do id watch paint dry before id recommend this god forsaken movie to anyone else oh and to make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the window that was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that waste of film
<START> it's highly stylized but this movie shows that real people appear on these shows and what seems like good fun and a chance to appear on television can have serious consequences br br yes i's mostly comedy but there are some sad moments
<START> stanley and iris' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life stanley's life is difficult because he never learned to read or write iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets stanley she decides to teach stanley how to read at her home in her spare time over time they become romantically involved after stanley learns to read he goes off to a good job in chicago only to return to iris and ask her to marry him br br it's a really good film without nudity violence or profanity that which is rare in today's films a good film all round br br
<START> after reading some quite negative views for this movie i was not sure whether i should fork out some money to rent it however it was a pleasant surprise i haven't seen the original movie but if its better than this i'd be in heaven br br tom cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable david convincing me that he is more than a smile on legs for only the third time in his career the other examples were magnolia and born on the fourth of july penelope cruz is slightly lightweight but fills the demands for her role as does diaz the only disappointment is the slightly bland kurt russell in the movie however it is not the acting that really impresses its the filmmaking br br cameron crowe excels in the director's role providing himself with a welcome change of pace from his usual schtick the increasing insanity of the movie is perfectly executed by crowe the brief sequence where cruise walks through an empty time square is incredibly effective the soundtrack a distinguishing feature of a crowe movie is also sublime br br you will be shocked and challenged as a viewer the plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly discussable the movie isn't perfect but its a welcome change of pace for cruise and crowe and for those raised on a diet of hollywood gloss should be a revelation
<START> when i was born this television series was the number one show on t v america epitomized the feat of the ultimate fatted calf country with big ambitions limitless potential and a very comfortable economy after a big sunday dinner why not sit back and watch bonanza in color this homey western evokes an american tradition which accompanies the complacency of the typical u s household during the era in which it was viewed the breathtaking cinematography of lake tahoe symbolized an infinite prosperity of the emerging american culture western movies were so popular that western television shows followed suit this was a period in time in our country which yearned for a concise reflection on our own country's struggle for survival the end result of the trials and tribulations at the ponderosa ranch as demonstrated in this series sparked a realization that americans are now auspiciously enjoying the fruits of the cartwright's painstaking labor br br the t v show bonanza was popular for so many different reasons mostly on account of the fact that the late fifties and early sixties had not yet established the divisiveness of two different cultural mindsets which was ready to surface with our nation the unification of ideologies in the united states which prevailed during the debut of bonanza was a big reason for the show's success in the show's later years bonanza had established a firmly entrenched core market television audience the cast to bonanza became famous and the wholesome entertainment of bonanza encompassed a camaraderie for the all american idealist everybody liked bonanza and a lot of americans totally loved it reflecting on rough and tumble family values is a favorite past time of many americans and the television show bonanza was perfect for that frame of mind i liked the show a lot and most people i know like it as well certainly my entire family loved bonanza this show was one of the all time american classics in the history of television
<START> this movie pretty much surprised me i didn't have very high expectations for it but i was wrong mary rhoda was very funny and well written they didn't spend too much time rehashing the past so they weren't relying on the success of the old tv show to carry the movie overall it was very entertaining br br my girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit com and i think i might agree with her
<START> welcome to collinwood is kind of a disaster considering the people involved it should've been multiple times better br br watching it if you're at least somewhat attached to the faith that it'll get better will probably make you cry it's one of those movies that had potential but was robbed of this potential thanks to a terrible script and some bad acting not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary george clooney character and the guy who reminds me of richard dreyfuss but about whom i care so little that i don't even want to know his name br br the film's only saving grace is the weird con vocabulary it introduces i found myself thinking of it time and time again as i watched more crime capers this is the only reason i gave the film a 3 the plot is boring the characters are neurotic needlessly offensive and highly unlikable they are in a constant state of agonizing stress and they're all so irritating that i celebrated their obstacles they yell at each other and swear crassly the dialogue is insipid at best and insultingly stupid at its low points br br i find that steven traffic soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and george clooney are to blame for this they should be tried for war crimes if anyone actually remembers this crap long enough to care
<START> unique movie about confused woman lindsay crouse who gets involved with sharp con men joe mantegna gives an oscar caliber performance as the slickest of the group absolutely enchanting first hour as mantegna shows crouse the ropes of his con games story line unravels a bit later on but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world definitely worth a shot
<START> this is one of the few movies i watched twice in the theatre i really love this movie for its atmosphere and its telling of the life of tragic hero esteban trueba he makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption isn't this a rather consoling thought br br when i watched it for the first time i thought that after the won election the movie would be over i didn't know the book so boy was i wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come i was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the film br br many people here utterly dislike this movie i cannot understand that one single bit maybe those who read the book first are as often with screen adaptations of novels simply disappointed that so many things have remained untold unseen unexplained but as a movie telling a touching story the story of a family the rise and fall of a man the deep compassion of a woman the strength of love and the insanity of hate and conservatism this movie is simply splendid furthermore the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful as well especially winona ryder and jeremy irons br br so definitely one of those films that cinema was invented for
<START> jane austen's emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best i have ever seen kake beckinsale's emma is irreproachable gwyneth paltrow with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography is able to bring out the comedy effectively she fails to make emma likeable paltrow is not aided by the fact that her hairstyles are simply 'wrong' for the part and i believe the era and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses kate beckinsale on the other hand manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what mr knightly the most romantic of jane austen's heroes actually sees in her mark strong is a splendid mr knightly with the right mix of handsome looks an appropriate age chivalry compassion and gentlemanly behaviour emma and mr knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful
<START> wow i have seen some really bad movies in my time but this one truly takes the cake it's the worst movie i've seen in the past decade no exaggeration br br as a us army veteran of the war in afghanistan i found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film not because it brought back memories far from it but because there was absolutely no attempt at authenticity to be found anywhere in the film not so much as the tiniest little shred it seemed like it had been written by an 8 year old child who got all his notions of war and soldierly behavior straight out of comic books the film was made in honduras which should have been a clue but even that can't fully explain the atrocious production values of this clichÃ© ridden piece of trash br br i could try to list all the endless technical flaws but it would take virtually forever from the ancient unit shoulder patches which have not been seen or worn since wwii and the character's name tags like colcollins worn by the character colonel collins which was actually spelled using the reversed mirror image n of the russian alphabet not the us alphabet the list just goes on and on the uniforms the equipment the plot and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves every single scene was just chock full of ridiculous flaws inaccuracies and utterly mindless clichÃ©s br br neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable it was all laughably childish in the extreme this was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to pre pubescent boys and i have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurd br br in short this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all it's a total waste of time i'd strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by it's truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for
<START> don't get me wrong i'm a huge fan of many of woody's movies obviously his late 70's masterpieces annie hall interiors manhattan and most of his late 80's early 90's dramas hannah crimes and misdemeaners husbands and wives in fact i even liked some of his more recent efforts melinda anything else small time crooks but this was abysmal i though it couldn't possibly be any worse than last years match point but how wrong i was br br it was lazily plotted basically a cross between match point manhattan murder mystery and small time crooks with all the jokes taken out woody seems to be on the way out as well slurring most of his lines and delivering 'hilarious' catchphrases 'i mean that with all due respect ' over and over until the blandness of it all becomes to much to bare br br i know that most actors are queuing up to work with him but they should at least read the script first scarlett johansson and hugh jackman are so much better than this and woody should really take a more behind the camera role in future if he has any sense about 20 miles behind it br br it wouldn't be so tragic if we didn't have so many great woody films to compare this to but it is clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort woody should call it a day before he becomes an industry joke br br embarrassingly bad
<START> i originally scored sarah's show with a nice fat 8 but i've struggled a bit with her humor of late and a thin 7 is what's settled in i shall explain br br you will either like sarah's humor or you won't if you don't i doubt anyone could persuade you you folks know who you are and it's perfectly fine but then you know that too moving on the first season gave us fantastic bits about sarah her friends and family and her pursuits in life in one memorable episode she is pulled over by officer jay whom she meets for the first time do you know why i am standing here he asks because you got all c's in high school she quizzically replies it seemed to be a genuine question that is funny stuff in my book sarah can come at you from odd angles in another episode her affair with god was notably funny god being petty and jealous added wonderfully to the joke it is clever it is a twisted view but she would show us the truth in the humor and we laughed br br then came the second season while still not without some new and inventive comedy we seem to have slipped somewhat into banal poop and fart jokes quite simply i get some good laughs here and there but much of it seems like filler while she and the writers struggle to foment some original material sophomoric and tiresome are the feelings i have for the episodes lately but i have been gutting it out for the gems i do find the turtle and waiting for her to turn it around i was a fan of her jesus is magic routine and would like to think that i understand what she is capable of let's get back to that
<START> i disliked this movie for numerous reasons within the first ten minutes of the film i grew extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself for me at least that it was going to have to pull itself out of the enormous hole it had dug unfortunately that did not occur the two draws of the movie for me were to see jane fonda and felicity huffman i don't know enough about lindsey lohan's work to have been interested in what she would bring to the film afterward i just felt disappointed in and for all three of them even though there were moments in each of their performances i imagine that for each of them to find their moments was a very difficult task given the fact that there was an amazing lack of character development and uninspired dialog although the plot is an interesting one the movie on the whole is so poorly written directed and edited that anybody's performance as an actor would suffer and be tainted by it the disrespectful way in which it dealt with sexual abuse and the trite and insulting viewpoint of small town america i think were the two main reasons why this film failed in hitting it's mark as one reviewer has noted and i would agree the movie is almost impossible to market given it's finished form i suspect that or at least hope that for the actor's sakes anyway there are some real gems on the cutting room floor sad for us but if that's true then the actors can take solace in that and feel somewhat good about lending their talents and time to such a flop oh yeah and another thing i wished for just once i could go see an american movie which included the sadly disappearing but wonderfully bucolic settings such as the one in this film where the main characters weren't absentmindedly and or disrespectfully littering the country side with pop cans smashed cds and other such trash
<START> this was a movie that i had heard about all my life growing up but had never seen it until a few years ago it's reputation truly proceeded it i knew of michael myers had seen the mask saw commercials for all of the crummy sequels that followed but i was growing up during the decade where jason and freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game and never thought much of the halloween franchise boy how i was being cheated with cheap knock offs br br halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie now by today's standards it isn't as graphic and visceral but this film delivers on all the other levels most horror movies fail to achieve today the atmosphere that john carpenter creates is so creepy and the fact that it is set in a quaint mid west town is a testament to his ability the lighting effects are down right horrifying with the shape seemingly appearing and disappearing into the shadows at will the simple yet brutally effective music score only adds to the suspense br br the performances by all the players are well done with specific nods to jamie lee curtis and donald pleasance ms curtis is such a good laurie strode because she is so likable and vulnerable it is all the more frightening when she is being stalked by michael myers because the director and viewer have invested so much into her we want her to survive and get away br br donald pleasance plays dr loomis like a man on a mission and it works well he adds a sense of urgency to the predicament the town finds itself in because he knows what evil stalks their streets br br overall not only is halloween a great horror movie but also a great film it works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lets up this should be standard viewing for anyone wanting to experience a truly scary movie and for an even more frightful time try watching it alone with the lights off don't be surprised if you think you see the shape lurking around in the shadows
<START> without question the worst film i've seen for a long while i endured to the end because surely there must be something here but no the plot when not dealing in clichÃ©s rambles to the point of non existence dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed characters never develop beyond sketches set pieces are clichÃ©d worse considering its co director the photography is only so so br br comments elsewhere that elevate this alongside get carter long good friday or kaspar hauser are way way off the mark lives of the saints lacks their innovation let alone their depth and shading in short their craft a ruthless editor could probably trim it down to a decent 30 minute short but as it stands it's a 6th form film project realised on a million pound scale rambling and bloated with its own pretensions that it received funding surely only because of rankin's name while other small films struggle for cash is depressing for the british film industry
<START> for the life of me i can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this totally unbelievable movie and i think i have the qualifications to say so i am a former special operations soldier with 14 years in the lifestyle this movie was totally totally unreal and obviously written by someone that did very little research into life in the army in combat or at a team or platoon level br br three eod guys trouncing around bagdad on their own get real no chain of command get real eod clearing buildings get real eod military intelligence sniper qualified buck sergeant get real wait i shot and killed a bad guy and then let two guys take me without firing another shot or being injured at all get real i carjack an iraqi civilian while i am only armed with a 9 mil break into another civilians house get punked by his wife then make it back to camp on foot in the middle of bagdad at night without as so much as a scratch or confrontation get real br br there is absolutely no adherence to military protocol army and no resemblance at all to any army unit that i have even encountered totally unbelievable and disrespectful to the men and women of eod who contrary to this poor film are not wild adrenaline seeking yahoos but extremely qualified professionals doing an incredibly hard job
