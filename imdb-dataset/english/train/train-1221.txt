<START> michael caton jones's scottish period piece bears little connection to the sir walter scott novel of the same name br br the film opens in the scottish highlands with robert roy mcgregor and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of his lordship james graham's cattle the scene then switches to a sword fighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs adorned shirts soft colored coats paleface make up and conventional gestures br br macgregor lives under the protection of a local lord named marquis of montrose when he enters an ill advised trade agreement with montrose he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of montrose's evil doers the unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape when rob roy is finally compelled to rebel against the english soldiers the action becomes well understood ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the blade br br liam neeson injects heroism and passion to his character he is intelligent fair and virile he carries his height with grace as the scottish chieftain of a small community he is a loving father a passionate lover and a noble husband driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains he'd rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust br br oscar winner jessica lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife a proud peasant woman brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat lange's lines are filled with dignity and integrity 'i will think on you dead until my husband makes you so and then i will think on you no more ' br br john hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make montrose something more than a greedy marquis ruthless with money and tempered by the english court's fashion for foppery he is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service honor in his view seems a quaint notion he has two objectives ruin the reputation of his rival the duke of argyle and to hunt down the fugitive macgregor he sends his soldiers to burn the highlanders' homes to kill their people and their livestock br br tim rothÂthe perfect antithesis to the hero is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer he is a penniless british aristocrat a nasty 'hired sword' wonderfully evil ravishing and murdering his way through the scottish mist his name is archibald cunningham he turns out to be a liar a thief and a murderer he dismisses himself as 'but a bastard abroad seeking his fortune and the favors of great men and therefore can't care about anyone else love is a dung hill and i am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow he even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he mistook for a girl br br cunningham seems pathetic he smiles foolishly and utters words with affected refinement but not terribly harmful until a muscular swordsman insults him and we discover that he's a cool head and an expert with a sword he really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a best supporting actor nomination br br and while brian cox is suitably odious as killearn andrew keir is montrose's rival the powerful local aristocrat the duke of argyll one of the few trustworthy men mcgregor meets outside his own family br br set in 18th century scotland and with an atmospheric musical score 'rob roy' is really a love story between a man and his wife a recognizably human story unjustly dwarfed by mel gibson's 'braveheart ' that does tell essentially the same story of provincial resentment of overbearing english landlords
<START> i saw this movie just now not when it was released and hailed as best picture of the year here in israel and to summarize everything right now i will just say this is not a good film br br this is dror shaul's second feature film and i have to admit that his first and the tv drama he made before this picture are much better further more this is his first attempt at directing a drama the early works were comedies and were funny and effective br br the first thing you have to know if you'll ever see this film israel of the 21st century hates the kibbutz and the values it represented since the formation of the state of israel the real situation of the kibbutzim is very dire and some of them disappear one by one the kibbutz hebrew word for collective was a sort of village for members only where the values of equality and socialism were the dogma for everyday life with the change in social values with time it seems now that the kibbutz was a place where the human spirit was repressed locked within the dogma rules with no ticket out the entrance of capitalist values and way of life in the 90's and so far made it very hard on the kibbutzim to survive the crazy mother in the film is the central metaphor for that br br but i regard this film as having nothing to do with nostalgia for the good old days of the kibbutz once it was a dream of every young couple to live in a kibbutz and raise children in this quite and beautiful environment but the film shows the opposite that the kibbutz with it's socialist dogma was a place sort of like a cult of crazy people with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of each individual within the collective this is the central philosophy of post modern capitalism your individuality is the most important thing you must place yourself in the center and no one else but you is the matter this is the philosophy the film stands for and that's just it's first sin br br if you disagree with me on the political side i'm sure you will agree that the acting the tone of the film it's script and it's direction are the four sins that follow the film has no real visual text and none of it's shots is something to remember it is also very delicate a delicacy that is no more than artsy fartsy attempt to provoke emotions which do not surface not in the film and not with the viewer it brings nothing but boredom br br can someone please explain why this film won so many prizes maybe because it shows that israel is in line with the rest of the world hating socialist and human values or maybe it shows that israel is a delicate place not giving in to dogmas and fanaticism that we are basically very human and good people capable of emotions especially when they are fake ones just like capitalism expects us to be or maybe because it tells one of the biggest lies of israeli cinema in recent years a lie that undermines the justification of the existence of the jewish state no matter what the answer is it's not a good one not for the world not for human values and not for the jews
<START> tim gary daniels wants desperately to break into serious television reporting when a job he begged for goes awry he is fired his beautiful but empty girlfriend elizabeth hurley says sayonara too coming home tim is startled to discover his house has an uninvited visitor christopher lloyd from the planet mars calling him uncle martin tim soon tries to help his new friend navigate life on earth but martin gets in trouble wherever he goes from the bathroom to the laundry room and more lovely lizzie daryl hannah finally sees an opportunity to make time with tim but the course of true love does not run smooth in this case either soon everyone in television is stalking tim hoping for a story about a true alien what's a man to do for those who loved the old television show of the same name with bill bixby and ray walston this film is not worthy to tie the proverbial boots its truly undeniably awful with no plot and a reliance on supposed special effects which fall flat too daniels is okay as the earthling but lloyd is simply terrible as the alien overacting up a storm the rest of the cast is adequate as are the costumes set and production details even if your children see the cover and beg for this film convince them to pick out another flick at the video store be assured kids and adults will find this movie a colossal bore so opt for a night at the museum or around the world in 80 days instead
<START> i couldn't believe this terrible movie was actually made at all with the worst actors you could find the worst script written mark frost sollace mitchell and by far the worst waste of time in viewing i won't belabor the story as it's really not worth it but i will elaborate on some of the performances and definitely the story as to the story it is very hard to believe that this bitty crazy schemer could actually do what she did that in reality the wife couldn't defend herself against a little bitty of a thing that the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all that the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up and the final result of the film is an insult to justice movie codes and the male species the theme of this mess is let women do as they wish kill whom they want defend the killer and get away with it while the guy rots in jail the innocent victim hard to believe that sollace mitchell the director and a man would even want to make this dribble br br as to the acting jordan ladd the killer is awful a loony toons who does needlepoint during her murder trial is this allowed in court she bored me to the hilt one more look of her batting her eyes and indicating how innocent she was and i'd throw up she's not even attractive enough for any guy to leave his wife the husband played on one level by vincent spano just seems to look and act stupid most of the time he was so predictable in his performance falling into the traps set for him by all the women surrounding him the worst by far was holland taylor as the defense attourney she over acted throughout the film and made a mockery of justice if she would cross examine me anytime i'd have told her to go take a hike everybody else in this sleazy film did their job as directed to do so br br i wish i could give this film a zero rating however we are forced to start with 1 too bad let's not have anymore painful watching films like this lifetime can do better then this i know it br br this is a postscript made the mistake of turning this insipid movie on by mistake as soon as i saw the bimbo jordan ladd i knew i'd seen it before and didn't like it or her i not only turned the darn thing off but had to add my anger at people like sollace mitchell who wrote the screenplay but also directed this horrible flick doesen't anyone see that her his message is that sickness pays being ill and going around killing people is okay with this director writer totally making the male species idiots well this male tells you to go stuff it somewhere painful we're not all that stupid and will speak out to your so called movie which in this person's mind deserves to be trashed br br and again this loser is shown why can't you read the comments on this stupid and despicable movie are we constantly subjected to see the bimbo jordan ladd again and again get her off tv films and out of sight she's just terrible in every sense of the word phew
<START> this movie is just bad bad bad bad now that i've gotten that out of the way i feel better this movie is poor from beginning to end the story is lame the 3 d segment is really bad freddy is at his cartoon character worst thank god they killed him off and who wants to see roseanne and tom arnold cameos br br the only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that we're given on freddy we see he once had a family and we get to see his abusive alcoholic father alice cooper br br other than that all bad there are some quality actors in here lisa zane and yaphet kotto and they do their best but the end result is just so bad the hour and a half i spent watching this movie is and hour and half i can't ever get back
<START> well let me just say something about these actors they really were a good decision and from experience having actors really brings the dialogue to life if you walk into this even fifteen minutes late you'll be in for a shock the movie will have already began you don't want to miss the first few jokes assuming you came to not miss any jokes br br wow i have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending not to be harsh i mean i loved it but it just surprised me that it really kept going until it stopped but i'm getting ahead of myself lets start with the very start of it when it began the plot outline goes like this there is this man and not to give away any spoilers spoiler alert he hasn't had any sex ever they use this plot device to set the story moving and there are intentionally or not it could go either way some funny situations had by the main characters some containing irony and jokes and awkward situations you know br br the director uses the advancements in technology by combining the film shot on the set and scripted dialog some music and jokes to make a funny movie designed as a comedy where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with an entirely full movie in between i went into this movie expecting to see a funny comedy because of what i already knew about it and left feeling as though i had just left a theater that just played a funny comedy ten stars
<START> some have praised atlantis the lost empire as a disney adventure for adults i don't think so at least not for thinking adults br br this script suggests a beginning as a live action movie that struck someone as the type of crap you cannot sell to adults anymore the crack staff of many older adventure movies has been done well before think the dirty dozen but atlantis represents one of the worse films in that motif the characters are weak even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best an md medicine man a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons if we have not at least seen these before we have seen mix and match quirks before the story about how one companion vinny played by don novello fr guido sarducci went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing br br only the main character milo thatch a young atlantis obsessed academic voiced by michael j fox has any depth to him milo's search for atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him the opening scene shows a much younger milo giddily perched on a knee as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head br br and while the characters were thin at best the best part about atlantis was the voice talent perhaps milo's depth is no thicker than fox's charm commander rourke loses nothing being voiced by james garner although rourke is a pretty stock military type garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery garner's vocal performance is the high point i'm sorry to say leonard nimoy's dying king is nothing more than obligatory additionally don novello as the demolition expert vinny santorini was also notable for one or two well done funny lines but i've always liked father guido sarducci anyway br br also well done was the computer animation the background animation that is the character animation has not been this bad for disney since the minimalism that drove don bluth out the door the character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter aside from landscapes buildings and vehicles there isn't much to impress br br the plot was the worst some say hackneyed or trite i'm not so sure about that any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint so the treatment is the thing and atlantis obviously lacks that br br i cannot begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section the plot was bad the plot's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense to add to that the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness br br spoilers br br 1 right at the beginning when milo reveals that runic or celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the coast of ireland should read the coast of iceland we begin to have problems the writers of the script would need to know the british take for eire or eireann as ireland and completely ignore the older latin term hibernia but more than this they need to know of the vikings conspiracy to call the greener island iceland and the icier island greenland br br by making it the matter of a mis tranliterated letter the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of english and a post roman date on the script since this is long after atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave and without visible clues and less technology than milo had made the inscription far less trustworthy br br 2 the shepard's journal could not be written before the sinking of atlantis or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying in the king's eye it must have been written after the sinking but without even the technology that milo's expedition had how the heck did anybody get by the leviathan so how could it know more about anything after that and why would it be written in atlantian br br automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things however clairvoyance and astral travel do not require the shepard to write in atlantian so it's got to be some sort automatic writing since noone left in atlantis can read it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface this would have made more sense but could also have been explained within the movie milo could have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life appeared in dreams etc this needed to be explored in the movie br br 3 the atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages no one expects that the original indo europeans would be able to converse in europe anymore than romans would understand that hard c s or their day became french ch s pronounced like sh s no less br br 4 current atlantians were alive before the cataclysm when apparently they could read yet now are unable to read what they used to or operate similar machinery br br 5 the mass illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie nothing seems to have happened to this culture it seems suspended in air until milo can rescue it even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival no one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused atlantis to fall into illiteracy br br 5 kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the cataclysm of stupidity set in but any of it hardly qualifies her father for deification kashakim's foolishness almost single handedly wiped his people from existence killed a bunch in the cataclysm stalled progress not a lot killed here but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody if they weren't boiled in lava first because the giant robots weren't there to protect them br br a bolt of blue electricity should have shattered kashakim's likeness when kida tried joining her father's image to the circle of great kings of atlantis br br 6 even though milo was the only one who could read atlantian rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or phases of the sun diagram br br 7 if milo's grandfather had told rourke about it it still does not explain what how rourke would have suffered from milo's reading it as part of the book ripping out the page which was dog eared in rourke's hand even though milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparently only was there to tip off the viewer that something was not quite right unless the word crystal would have set alarms off in milo's head that somebody would try to steal it milo would have suspected nothing it's just thick headed foreshadowing br br 8 the crew's double cross was not a character change we learned that vinny sweet audrey and cookie had been going along with rourke from the beginning however the change of heart falls flat it was a change and needed to be better motivated hard to do with characters who weren't given anything to begin with br br 9 niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from it's liquid it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas br br 10 the ending stinks and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness with it's powersource restored atlantis is no longer a weak power needing coddling the giant robot guardians and the sky cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might the technology is superior to ours and definitely to early 20th century in the end milo needs to teach the atlantians to read for what the whole idea is to leave their little quiet chastened culture alone not to send it into hyperdrive br br end spoilers br br perhaps the lost world plot and the turn of the century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps the failures i find with the film agree with this idea but i am at a loss why i should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well and pulp stories is part of the crap they can't sell adults anymore anyway we have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well raiders of the lost ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness br br 4 out of 10 the movie is enjoyable but as i think about the plot it seeps ever lower
<START> i personally hated this movie because it was predictable the characters were stereotypical and the whole idea was a rip off of the cutting edge and cadet kelly br br the main character is a snotty girl who gets shipped of to a place where she doesn't belong the whole place hates her and to make things worse there is a hot guy that seemingly doesn't like her well duh the whole damn school can't stand you amazingly she finds a way to fit in and make everyone to like her plus gets the guy to fall head over heels in love with her then comes the choice where she must choose between figure skating and hockey she chooses hockey then she goes to the figure skating nationals and gets to be on the olympic team no real surprise there br br this whole movie was so damn predictable you knew what was going to happen before you even saw it this was so awful i nearly puked and by the time i was finished watching it i had an awful headache and the urge to shoot myself for watching such crap don't watch this unless you are under ten or actually like crappy tween movies
<START> despite some mildly thought provoking oddities in the script and the film's overall curiosity value fury of the wolfman emerges as a dull uninteresting excursion into lycanthropy saved only by the statuesque presence of villainess perla cristal the rest of the players including the hammy naschy are a complete write off though admittedly none are helped by often atrocious dubbing although the screenplay packs in enough variations on werewolf frankenstein dr moreau themes to flesh out a dozen movies the plot is so unevenly developed the characterizations so feeble and the dialogue so verbosely ridiculous at least in the english version that any latent interest in the turgid proceedings is soon quashed br br zabalza's direction seems jerky even amateurish his staging is clumsy and ineffective he is not helped by villasenor's over bright lighting even promising sets are so unatmospherically photographed that the director's few attempts to give the audience a fright are signaled far in advance br br other credits fall into a similar pattern of ineptitude though the stridently over emphatic music score and the laughably crude totally primitive special effects deserve special condemnation
<START> a great concept gone wrong poor acting even worse writing after watching the first two episodes i was wondering why it ever made it to season two the characters are forgettable the writing is poor the sets are just ok the special effects are simply sad so much better has been made in the same time frame where is the money going on this one the first episode starts out interesting then goes downhill fast the precept of the whole show is just silly now don't get me wrong i am a huge sci fi fan and 'geek' but this show simply doesn't cut it as i said in the beginning i am truly surprised it made it to season two so much better has been canceled after only one season jake 2 0 for example this show was just bad
<START> i have to say the first i watched this film was about 6 years ago and i actually enjoyed it then i bought the dvd recently and upon a second viewing i wondered why i liked it the acting was awful and as usual we have the stereo typical clansmen in their fake costumes the acting was awful at best tim roth did an ok job as did liam neeson but i've no idea what jessica lange was thinking br br the plot line was good but the execution was just poor i'm tired of seeing scotland portrayed like this in the films braveheart was even worse though which is this films only saving grace but seriously people didn't speak like that in those days why do all the actors have to have glaswegian accents just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes i notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the americans and to be honest i can see why they'd like it i know they have an infatuation for men in kilts however if you are thinking of buying the dvd i'd say spend your money on something else like a better film
<START> one can only imagine the film mr welles might have finished without the interference of the studio this film is a flawed welles but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps america's best motion picture director of all times br br we can see the toll it took on orson welles the filming of this movie the story has a lot of holes in it perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives that didn't trust the director br br it is curious by reading some of the opinions submitted to imdb that compare orson welles with the coen brothers roman polanski even woody allen when it should be all of those directors that must be regarded as followers of the great master himself no one was more original and creative in the history of american cinema than mr welles lucky are we to still have his legacy either in retrospective looks such as the one the film forum in new york just ended or his films either on tape or dvd form br br rita hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here if she was a beauty with her red hair as a blonde she is just too stunning for words everett sloan and glenn anders made an excellent contribution to the movie br br the only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece to be added to orson welles body of work was his own appearance in it had he concentrated in the directing and had another actor interpret michael o'hara a different film might have been achieved altogether orson welles has to be credited for being perhaps a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio lot into the street the visuals in this film are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing this movie truly impressed for the work the vision and the talent he gave us
<START> a handful of nonprofessional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature this creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop motion animation but oh how you will long for that margin when for the rest of the movie the animation is replaced by production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth no time for terror when this movie is hijacked halfway through by these comic relief boat rental doofuses who suddenly become the lead characters but again you gotta admit watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff only at the end one of them gets eaten and the other one is left sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness that's no fun
<START> originally i rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer and i was not disappointed that way except the plot interfered with the soccer scenes as a dad i suppose i was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism but i have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays as uncomfortable as i feel with the topic in a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices this dilemma is introduced by a young british born teen girl jasminder jess of east indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer the pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore in a nice way her hopes and fears for her future br br the multi cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore jess's frustration with her parents expectations for her again no different in substance than most child parent relationships br br in summary the soccer scenes are great lots to learn in slowmo and while i didn't need the storyline something was needed to keep the movie going
<START> this movie was made for tv so taking that into account i'm not going to rip into it as hard as i would a feature film the script is sub par but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots whether it means to be or not the acting is mostly over the top but that is true for many lower budget movies br br the aspect of this movie that i really hated though was that 90 95 of it is shot on film but in random places there will be 5 10 seconds where the footage is shot on video you can tell because there is less contrast the colors are less vivid and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second i'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film i assume this is why anyway but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look br br anyway i've definitely seen worse movies but i definitely wouldn't say that i enjoyed this movie and i can't recommend that anyone see it
<START> this documentary by marian cooper is absolutely amazing i saw it tonight on turner classic movie channel i think i will see if i can order a copy of it on dvd the film footage doesn't look all blurry and choppy like you might think from 1925 b w silent film set in iran in 1925 the nomadic tribe people in the documentary leave their desert home and cross a raging river men women children animals then up and over a snowy mountain pass all barefoot it is sink or swim and climb or die in search of grass for their animals they have cows goats dogs horses mules in one scene a man is carrying a mule who is too sick to climb the mountain the children in the documentary all look happy and healthy they had such a hard life i wonder if the nomadic tribes of iran still live like this makes you appreciate modern life in usa
<START> loosely based on the james j corbett biography the roar of the crowd gentleman jim is a wonderfully breezy picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the pugilistic prancer that was corbett but also the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the 1890s br br the story follows corbett a perfectly casted errol flynn from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in san fransico thru to a chance fight with an ex boxing champion that eventually leads to him fighting the fearsome heavyweight champion of the world john l sullivan beefcake personified delightfully by ward bond not all the fights are in the ring tho and it's all the spin off vignettes in corbett's life that makes this a grand entertaining picture there are class issues to overcome here perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a peg or two and corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as briskly as his reputation does along with the quite wonderful corbett family and all their stoic humorous support corbett's journey is as enthralling as it is joyous yet as brash and as bold as he is he is a very likable character and it's a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of gentleman jim br br the film never sags for one moment and it's a testament to director raoul walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture thank you alexis smith the fight sequences stand up really well and they perfectly show just how corbett became the champ he was his brand of dancing rings round slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history as the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between sullivan and corbett puts all the brutality into context and it's here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner and as far as this viewer goes it will do for me to be sure to be sure 9 10 for a truly wonderful picture
<START> simply great movie no doubt about it great story and superb performances be it amitabh akshay shefali priyanka boman or rajpal hindi film industry is going shameless with mallika and co this movie is totally vulgarity free and therefore bound to fail in vulgarity addicted our indian society but the message and concept this movie carries are absolutely superb anu malik boring copy cat could have been avoided and ismail darbar or himmesh reshmmiya could have been used as musician i think vipul shah should have given little bit gujarati touch particularly in music also anu malik is worst musician around and he thinks himself popstar but this is not the movie where is presence was required he looks only good with govinda style songs i felt some nice serious music with couple of good ghazals or sad songs could have made this movie more memorable
<START> this enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast and many memorable scenes the big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents the spanish characters in the film are played by a frenchman boyer a belgian francen a greek paxinou and a hungarian lorre and to top it all off bacall is supposed to be an english aristocrat despite these absurdities the performances are all very good especially those of paxinou and lorre but the scene in which boyer paxinou and lorre meet and talk in wildly different accents is a real hoot and i guess seeing as how they were alone that they should actually have been speaking in spanish anyway it seems pretty weird that the brothers warner couldn't find any spanish speaking actors in los angeles of course hollywood has often had an any old accent will do policy my other favorite is greta garbo swedish as mata hari dutch who falls in love with a russian soldier played by a mexican ramon novarro maybe they should have got novarro for confidential agent he would have been great in boyer's role or at least in francen's which would have saved greatly on the dark make up budget
<START> its a gem movie if anyone who hasn't seen movie sholey he cant understand what is going on there a thakur call men for catching a big terrorist who is like god and even police don't know abut him but these ppl do br br biggest advantage of film is its speed u never know what is going on and the part is completed actors are at there best of worst acting and actress is here for time pass of songs and what u cant forget is the cool dialouge which seems to come in very long time but u cant understand them so easily try hard for that and last word i haven't seen movie complete due to a brain roast so plz tell me ditz end if it have
