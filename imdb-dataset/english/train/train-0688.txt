<START> this movie was exactly what i expected it to be when i first read the casting i probably could have written a more exciting plot it's a pity that they left it to a pack of howler monkeys alberto tomba was surely a good skier but he has to thank god and we too that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn his living he can't play he can't talk he can't even move very good on mainland without his skis michelle hunziker is a pretty blonde girl and that's all she obviously wasn't chosen for her astounding competence in dramatic roles but most probably for her nice legs nevertheless i must admit that she could be the tomba's acting teacher because he's even a worse actor than her and that's funny especially considering that she isn't italian i laughed all the time watching this movie i found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually made me laugh loud very loud
<START> this first rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement romance and james stewart to the screen the far country is the only one out of all five stewart mann westerns that is often overlooked stewart yet again puts a new look on the ever present personalities he had in the five stewart mann westerns jeff webster stewart is uncaring always looking out for himself which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him ironically he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without this displays that he might just care for one person his sidekick ben tatum played by walter brennan since tatum is the one that gave it to him mann yet again puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five stewart mann westerns he displays violence excitement plot twists romance and corruption the story is that jeff and ben through a series of events wind up in the get rich quick town of dawson along with gold partners calvet and flippen and no good but beautiful roman and her hired men they are unable to leave because crooked sheriff mr gannon mcintire and his deputies will hang them since the only way out is through skagway which is gannon's town but eventually mcintire comes to them but not to collect stewart and or his fine that he supposedly owes to the government what is mcintire there for he is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money people are killed a sheriff for dawson is considered needed and calvet elects stewart because he is good with a gun stewart however refuses the job because he plans to get all the gold he can and then pull out he also refuses it because he does not like to help people since law and order always gets somebody killed so flippen is elected instead a miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of gannon's men a purely evil mustachioed fancy gunman named madden who carries two guns played by wilke flippen attempts to arrest madden and see that justice be done but he cannot stand up to him so he becomes the town drunk a man named yukon replaces flippen stewart and tatum start to pull out but are ambushed by gannon's men tatum is killed and stewart is wounded stewart finally realizes that he must do something or gannon will take over dawson set up his own rules and it will become his town just like skagway the audience also realizes what stewart must do another thing that the audience realizes is that stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and gannon if stewart leaves gannon would take over the town if stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly this is where a great scene occurs stewart walks into his cabin he has a sling on his arm for a few seconds his gun in the gunbelt is hanging on a post beside his bed the gun is close up stewart is in the background just inside the door he stares at it for a few seconds he tosses the sling away the sling lands on the back of a chair and falls to the floor this is symbolic because he is throwing away his old life which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself he comes into his new life of helping people when they need help what ends the film is a guns blazing furious show of good against evil and a genuinely feel good feeling that everything will be alright
<START> watching the first 30 minutes of sands of oblivion gave me high hopes it seemed i was in for a cheaper version of the mummy the setup was promising in the 1920's cecil b demille makes his opus of the ten commandments it seems in using real egyptian artifacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil don't they always aware of what had been unleashed demille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site the movie's first mistake but hey those period costumes are expensive and this is a sci fi channel movie the first sightings we get of the anubis monster are well done and it's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy cg effect then the body counts starts this is were the movie went south for me the reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do they make the usual stop to the guy who knows the truth but never told anyone after getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site no they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk really i'm not the most motivated person but if i knew a demon from ancient egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me i'd put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem after this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the anubis monster in the usual way by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it's standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades for a sci fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out which isn't saying much at all what disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it
<START> this movie is witty watchable and utterly touching and now often do you get to see jean harlow or any actress of this era for that matter give another woman a swift punch in the jaw twice br br after harlow's ruby is sent to a reformatory after getting mixed up with gable's edward hall he of that cheesy yet endearing crooked smile her predicament becomes all the more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant and she's convinced that this rake has abandoned her but in fact her love has reformed him and he comes to see her despite the fact that he will be arrested and from the help of a minister are married br br the wonderful relationship that harlow shares with her fellow inmates is second only to her electric chemistry with gable who was her most frequent leading man her cynical character is a perfect match for gable's smooth talking crook what's not to like br br you know you wouldn't be a bad looking dame if it wasn't for your face ruby cuttingly remarks to gypsy her rival if you're going to get that close to me i'll have to open the other window br br priceless
<START> it's a testament to gosha's incredible film making prowess that he was able to complete both hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece goyokin in the same year 1969 and it's a testament to how criminally underrated he remains for the general public compared to media darlings like the great akira kurosawa that both hitokiri and goyokin have received less than 500 votes between the two of them br br shintaro katsu is okada izo mad dog killer loyal to the tosha clan and their boss takechi played by another genre stalwart tatsuya nakadai the tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the emperor against the flailing shogunate the historical backdrop is fairly accurate with japan's increasing political turmoil between imperialists and the tokugawa and the pressure by the west to end a 300 year social and political seclusion it helps a lot to know a thing or two about japanese history and what eventually led to the meiji restoration and the abolition of the tokugawa shogunate but it's not essential by any means the movie was made primarily for a japanese audience so certain things are taken for granted but it flows very well for the uninitiated as well br br as one would expect from a hideo gosha film in his golden years the late 60's the visual palette is breathtaking the use of external and internal symbolism hiding behind pictorial beauty style however is never decorative for gosha it is always employed in the service of story br br and speaking of story hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the tortured main character izo okada as most chambara protagonists izo finds himself in a moral double bind torn between giri obligation and ninjo natural impulse although it takes a while for him to realize what exactly his giri is in the first half of the movie izo is trying for social self advancement lofty aspirations of social rank and marriage with an aristocrat's daughter a great progression for someone coming from a farmer's background in the rigid social caste system of 19th century japan br br the turning point for izo is when he realizes at what cost self advancement comes the loss of identity and by consequence the loss of self it is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous swordsman of the tosha clan to a nameless drifter without past or future torazo the vagrant although not technically nameless and not a genre drifter in yojimbo's mold it is the loss of his former self and the cast off of ego ambition and self dillusion that allows izo to see things as they really are and redeem himself br br hitokiri ends which i won't reveal here in the best way any story can end both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives izo the last laugh a last sardonic remark in the face of death
<START> i'm a fan of columbo especially on a rainy saturday and it was fun to see oskar werner after fahrenheit 451 but this episode was very lacking the original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed way in advance even years before the modern detective shows of today but it was amusing to see the crazy couch patterns and modern electronics equipment and of course the mandatory suburbanite humor poking fun at modern art for sale the high tech home is a jetson's or disney version of tomorrowland and fun to think of writers inventing those way out gizmos br br if its sunny outside go play as there are much better columbo episodes still we should be thankful for cable tv that these episodes are being broadcast
<START> despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved apart from a clichÃ©s only plot the movie is let down by some weak acting accents and overall lack of tension br br whilst having the overall look of a big budget for nz the feel is decidedly small town kiwi br br has anyone not seen the brothers http imdb com title tt0250274 those who have will pick the similarities straightaway i've heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clichÃ©d boys talking crap but it comes across as forced br br i believe oscar keightley sees himself as deeply ironic but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious br br those who have any doubts left at all that samoans living in nz culture has been deeply hopefully not permanently affected by american speech culture and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie br br robbie magasiva always looks good on screen but is let down by the script br br it always rubs me up the wrong way when a comedy has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clichÃ©d punchline see the wanna be white boy br br i know someone who found this movie hilarious however that person has the brains of a tadpole and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars br br that kinda sums up the mentality of this flick ok but not great fun but not funny wake up nz this is not a 5 star movie despite all the glowing middle class white guilt reviews br br my advice if you watch it get drunk first
<START> the trailers for this film were better than the movie what waste of talent and money wish i would've waited for this movie to come on dvd because at least i wouldn't be out 9 the movie totally misses the mark what could have been a great movie for all actors turned out to be a b movie at best movie moved very slow and just when i thought it was going somewhere it almost did but then it didn't in this day and age we need unpredictable plot twists and closures in film and this film offered neither the whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good however not sure if it was the way it was directed the lighting the delivery of lines the writing or what but nothing came from it lot of hype for nothing i was very disappointed in this film and i'm telling everyone not to see it the cheesy saxophone music throughout made the film worse as well and the ending had nothing to do with the rest of the film what a disappointment
<START> lloyd bridges as mike nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series what made it so good to me when i watched it was the real feel of going underwater the show exhibits a youthful energy energy for exploration under water which is infectious br br the show was educational as well showing the viewer things about scuba diving from someone who appeared to be a consummate pro mike nelson there were excellent shows and the program always appeared to be well produced granted the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than 1 episode but each show holds it's own with any other show produced during this era the infancy of american television
<START> possible spoilers re late appearing cameos br br seldom does one see so many fine memorable character actors almost entirely actresses to be precise in one film even though a few only appear for cameos each one is a gem the british do this mix of comedy and real life pathos better than anyone imo so it is no surprise that most of the actors are brits br br the music is great no doubt much had to be dubbed does leslie caron really play the bass so well maybe who knew but clio lane was unmistakably herself her warm visceral sound still turns my crank like few other jazz singers br br as an aging musician myself not quite as old and certainly not in that class of course it was a heartening film as well a great film for anyone whose wondering if they're past it in their profession or avocation whatever it may be and of course a great celebration of the life of the stage br br i missed a little of the opening but a provisional 9 10 and it certainly makes we want to see the whole thing
<START> is it a good idea to use live animals for department store window displays br br no and here's why br br in hare conditioned the sale that bugs is helping promote is over and the store manager nelson is transferring him to a new department taxidermy naturally bugs objects and the fun begins br br using nearly every department in the store children's wear sports shoes costumes women's nightgowns don't ask bugs comes out on top at every turn even referring to the manager as the great gildersneeze even when trapped in the confines of an elevator bugs makes the best of the situation br br director jones is on top of his pictorial game as always as are blanc as bugs natch and nelson the manager who does sound like radio mainstay gildersleeves go ask your grand parents br br and a sage word of advice when confronted by a fuzzy looking woman wanting to try on bathroom slippers always check her ears br br ten stars for hare conditioner the best argument yet for animal labor laws
<START> this movie really rocks jeff wincott is terrific in the film his fighting incredible he is such a fast martial artist brigitte nielsen matthias hues was very good mission of justice is an action packed movie that is never boring if you like fighting movies with incredible non stop action then check out mission of justice today
<START> i agree with the other comments i saw this movie years ago christopher plummer is hilarious as a dandy the ribaldry is unsurpassed if this comes out on video i will definitely buy it
<START> i'm trying to picture the pitch for dark angel i'm thinking matrix i'm thinking bladerunner i'm thinking that chick that plays faith in angel wearing shiny black leather or some chick just like her leave that one with us only get this we'll do it without any plot dialogue character decent action or budget just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes right br br flashy shallow dreary formulaic passionless tedious dull dumb humourless desultory barely competent live action anime without any action or indeed any life sf just the way joe fanboy likes it in fact
<START> could anyone please stop john carpenter from continuously and deliberately ruining his reputation how low can you go it seems this man has lost any self respect br br this episode looks like it has been done by a film student it isn't even worth beginning to talk about what was bad because it was just a borefest directed by somebody with no talent as a filmmaker or without any motivation br br come on mr carpenter please retire immediately with a rest of self esteem and stop spilling out trash like this in a bad tradition from escape from l a to ghosts of mars br br get drunk instead
<START> i happened on shower in the foreign film section of my local video store and passed it over several times since from its cover it looked like a farce or comedy i then lucked into a copy to purchase at economical price and am happy for my luck shower is the story of three 3 men a father and two 2 adult sons each coming to terms with life changes as the world around them also continues to change in modern china as with many foreign films the chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting facets of this movie br br beyond the fascinating characteristics of the local chinese color giving the setting to this story is the difficult yet touching relationships between the men and a sole woman involved in the story all set against the backdrop of a village bathhouse br br the family's story moves from estrangement to understanding and made me glad i came to know these people added to the main story are the numerous small characters bathhouse customers and their individual conflicts and friendships shower is a film one walks away from smiling and touched by its warmth and humanity
<START> oliver gruner is totally unknown to me my friend showed me this film because he had seen gruner in what he called a pretty good sci fi film nemesis so as we watched this we found ourselves fastforwarding through the bs drama parts just to get to the unbelievable action sequences gruner loves to kick and kick and kick and kick haha br br gruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in he finds himself watching after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in the mexican gang that keeps tormenting his family instead of joining up gruner tells the boy to fight back against a gang too crazy gruner plays a typical van damme character who kills everyone or maims them pretty bad and works to rid his block of these gangmembers br br the plot was very cheesy and easy to think of gruner is probably not very well known because of his script choosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to this ghetto is pure hell and i enjoyed seeing the motley crew of characters go through it as if they have a chance against gruner's character the music was typical action music thumping pianos and timpani swelling guitars which actually wasn't as bad as i make it sound the director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment br br ultimately i gave it a 4 10 because it really tried to be an average action film for oliver gruner to star in but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw
<START> updating of the bliss theme is merely the latest in a lengthening queue of bad to average local comedies which appeal to the conservative cinema going set for the record this list all of the films on which appear to be attempting a castle esque miracle includes strange bedfellows thunderstruck bad eggs the honourable wally norman horseplay the wannabes and the nugget the only one to have worked has been crackerjack br br here the performances never mesh as john howard doesn't even look like he's in the right film Â though perhaps that was the intention as franklin plays sleepy conservative suburbia against its more interesting inhabitants 20 year old virgins who live with their parents are becoming rarer on screen but this is hardly a reason to watch the film in fact the only reasons may well be 1 howard's bizarre Â but quite fun Â performance and 2 the 'suburban nightmare' theme which has run through somersault strange bedfellows tom white alexandra's project danny deckchair the rage in placid lake traveling light teesh trude swimming upstream and lantana many of which are very good excellent enter at own risk may be one for people who titter at the word 'penis' 4 10
<START> somehow they summed up the 60's ten years that radically changed our country in four hours and what a painful four hours it was they trivilized the major events and happenings and they claimed it was about two families yet you barely saw the african american family if i were nbc i would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash what was amusing was this happy go lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways but managed to attend every major 60's event through the country and the second family was such a non factor they devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family that poor son please nbc do not make any movies about any other eras leave that to pbs and the history channel
<START> i heard tell that madonna was briefly considered for the catherine tremell role compared to sharon stone madonna is too coarse and bauerisch she's not even close br br evil incarnate sharon stone is a bit long in the tooth the ameliorative effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding however she artfully treats us to a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption in the obligatory sex scene she projects pure crystalline lust especially her hooded luminous eyes and a face flat with pleasure thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques the harsh lines of age are only occasionally manifest rather she seems to have a slight golden glow yes yeats br br the locations gave us a view of london that is a welcome departure from the usual londonscapes the catherine character is so powerful and menacing that i thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed i wouldn't have had a chance br br the original basic instinct attempts at censorship i must briefly comment on the original 1992 film set in san francisco a beautiful city worthy of this film it is outstanding from the music to the locations to the sets and so on paul verhoven pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew br br that the main baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of bay area gay and lesbian activist groups attempts at censorship were vehemently denied swell these philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script insisting on re writes that would promote their political and psychiatrically driven agendas example sanctimoniously alleging sexism and misogyny they demanded that the lead role be switched from bad girl to bad guy br br on locations in san francisco the gentle tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming of the scenes with noise flashing lights and other tactics the executive producers mario kassar and andrew vajna vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restraining orders against the disruptive tactics br br blowback thanks to the fulminating activists the film got huge national press coverage millions of dollars worth of free advertising their calls for viewers to boycott the film resulted in a backlash that had customers waiting in long lines wherever the film was launched it also received widespread critical acclaim it was in the words of the reptilian hackett in network a big titted hit sorry gentle reader i just couldn't resist that one yes it's a gibe br br in conclusion i believe that both basic instinct 1 and 2 with their brilliant musical scores aesthetics and acting are works of art br br that deserve protection under our constitution
