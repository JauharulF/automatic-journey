<START> actress patty duke wrote an insightful funny rough hewn book about her career as an actress her crazy quilt love life and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts which almost put her away for good with this rich material to draw from and patty playing herself in the final act one would think a crack tv director like gilbert cates could bring it all together on film but call me anna is a pale shadow of duke's autobiography for those who haven't read the book the sketchy narrative leaping forward in time isn't absorbing we are never allowed to get our bearings with what's happening and the production seems stunted by a low budget the actors are miscast and the value of having duke herself finally appear does not pay off the film's phony reality is so thick at this point that patty can't bring stability to the scenario it appears as if the producers were sincere enough and consciousness minded to anxiously steer the film towards duke's ultimate diagnosis and mental freedom but they left out many dramatic opportunities in the process
<START> there aren't too many times when i see a film and go huh what but this was one of them maybe after seeing zabriskie point i felt much the same way woody allen felt after seeing 2001 he only liked the film after seeing it three times over a two year period realizing the filmmaker was ahead of him in what was going on michelangelo antonioni in one of his few tries at making films inside of the us after red desert he did blow up this film china and the passenger all filmed outside his native italy i could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own mastery of the medium the results show that he doesn't lack the means to present images feelings tones colors sounds and a visual representation of this era a director's job is to see antonioni once stated whatever that means he doesn't disappoint for the admirer of his post fifties work i say post fifties since i've yet to see any of his films from before l'avventura br br what he does lack is a point at least the kind of point that he could bring in blow up and the eclipse you get the feeling of what is around these characters what the themes are bringing forth to their consciousness however in this case the characters and the actors don't bring much conviction or purpose antonioni coming from the school of hard knocks neo realistic film making does do what he can with his mostly non professional cast those who look most like real actors are subjugated to the roles of the corporate characters but the two stars mark frechette and daria halprin seem as if antonioni's under directing them perhaps that was the point the story's split into three acts thankfully not too confusing as mark escapes his existence around the boiling dangerous campus life going on in the circa late 60's la area and daria is sent out from la to drive to phoenix for some business meeting they meet by chance as mark's plane how does he know how to drive maybe a little background info there and daria's car meet up and they spend some time together in an existential kind of groove out in the desert aside from a stylistically mesmerizing if bizarre sex scene much of this act isn't terribly interesting br br the two leads are fair enough to look at but what exactly draws them to each other outside of curiosity the ideas that come forth in part from a screenplay co written by sam shepard aren't too revealing except for one brief instant where drugs vs reality is brought up then the film heads towards the third act as mark decides to do the right thing under disastrous circumstances and daria arrives at her boss' place only to be in full disillusionment not taking into account the infamous last five minutes or so of the film although the film took its time telling its story i didn't have as much of a problem with that as i did that the story only engages a certain kind of viewer i understand and empathize with the feelings and doubts and fears as well as the self confidence of the anti establishment but maybe antonioni isn't entirely fully aware of it himself in some scenes he as director and editor and the often astounding cinematography by alfio contini find the scenery and backgrounds more enlightening and fixating than the people in the foreground not to say the technical side of zabriskie point isn't involving to a degree this may make some feel drowsy as antonioni is probably far greater as a documentary filmmaker as he is a theatrical director like say francis ford coppola is br br the deserts skies city and even the faces in close ups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame bringing us in the soundtrack is equally compelling with a master stroke including a sweet rolling stones song at one point and then a crushing surreal pink floyd song re titled from 'careful with that axe eugene one of their best pre dark side in the explosion sequence if only the performances weren't so one sided i might find this to be on par with blow up or the eclipse it's an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand and on the other a boring take on what was the hippie radical movement of the late 60's but hey what may be boring for an american such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the us such as say italy and it does ask to not be discarded right away after one viewing
<START> this comedy is really not funny it' a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact it's a caper film so derivative yes even back then it has no snap br br the cast is adequate more than that it's hard to say however what's nice is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm this would have starred robert montgomery the wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresses br br we can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today and the production values aren't awful yet it makes no real impression br br it's a generic knockoff and who wants that
<START> ringmaster jerry springer's pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film first of all it was made second of all people went to see it third some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen if a monkey could make a movie i'm 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good most crappy movies have their moments even godzilla had a few cool special effects this film's moment was when i left the theater nauseated the only thing that possibly could've made this movie any worse would be if jerry springer was the star if i want to stare at crap for an hour and a half i'll take a dump in a can if anyone didn't utterly despise this movie i pity you and your children and your children's children's children however contrary to springer's beliefs i clearly don't condone children having sex
<START> at least it's not full of sensless violence or fluff it's also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline this story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green the story is disjointed and goes off in strange br br directions to no conclusion i also don't believe the director spent much time around a golf country club either some of the depictions are absurd not very engaging
<START> this work is less about steve martin's character davis than it is about kline mack and glover simon and kline and mcdonnell claire but the dialog inserted via davis is pondering contemplative near poetic existentialism at its best he is witty intelligent and thoughtful in both dialog delivery and content the writers deserved an oscar br br the performances are easy relaxed and natural just what you would expect from a list actors martin contributes the performance which leads into his more recent shopgirl guiding you through life love and the pursuit of wisdom if not happiness kline is the straight the suit the conformist of the film and as such his performance is crisp and refreshing br br this work deals with life in all aspects it engenders a true emotional investment in its characters and leaves you feeling hopeful that mankind is not doomed after all no matter what you believe deep down br br all in all this is delightful with a gritty moment or two and easy natural dialog which draws you in assisting its audience in gaining a high enjoyment from this work it's definitely worth your time though it may not be every one's top choice as friday saturday night entertainment br br i really enjoyed the intelligence this exhibited it's not typical and was an unexpected surprise another wonderful surprise was the honesty exhibited herein the couples and friends hold detailed conversations which feel and sound fully honest and again natural i was very impressed with this work and will be adding it to the dvd collection soon br br it rates a 9 1 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i'm well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective programmes with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this
<START> i remember this film exhibit in barcelona spain in 1970 for the time of a week although it could seems incredible and i can't offer any explanation for it this movie was exhibit in a theater dedicated to movies of art and big quality that is bergman resnais malle buÃ±uel and the projected man few people saw it luckly people no doubt and no reference about this very boring sf movie can be found in the peter nichols science fiction encyclopidie or about the author of the original novel very indicative i remember of it after all this years a no story a lot of special effects that seems ridiculous effects in fact and no more it seems that in some countries the running time is 90 mm and in anothers 77 min well it means only a little more of pain
<START> sir john gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this one br br this is one of those films i suppose that is considered art but don't be fooled it's garbage stick to the art you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually unintelligible forgeries like this br br in this masterpiece giegud recites shakespeare's the tempest while the camera pans away to nude people one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool wow this is heady stuff and real art ain't it that's just one example most of the story makes no sense is impossible to follow and hence is one that liberal critics are afraid to say they didn't understand so they give it high marks to save their phony egos you want shakespeare read his books
<START> sexo cannibal or devil hunter as it's more commonly known amongst english speaking audiences starts with actress model laura crawford ursula buchfellner as ursula fellner checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant jane gisela hahn after a long days work laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious character's named chris werner pochath thomas antonio mayans burst in kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous jane laura's agent gets on the blower to rent a hero peter weston al cliver who is informed of the situation the kidnappers have laura on an isolated island are demanding a 6 million ransom peter is told that he will be paid 200 000 to get her back safely a further 10 of the 6 million if he brings that back as well faster than a rat up a drain pipe peter his vietnam vet buddy helicopter pilot jack are on the island deciding on how to save laura so the kidnappers have laura peter has the 6 million but neither want to hand them over that much just to complicate things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe hell in all the generations they've lived there they've only managed to build one straw hut now that's primitive who worship some cannibal monster dude burt altman with bulging eyes as a god with human sacrifices this cannibal has a liking for young white female flesh intestines br br this spanish french german co production was co written directed by the prolific jesus franco who also gets the credit for the music as well sexo cannibal has gained a certain amount of notoriety here in the uk as it was placed on the 'video nasties' list in the early 80's under it's alternate devil hunter title therefore officially classed as obscene banned having said that i have no idea why as it is one bad film even franco who isn't afraid to be associated with a turkey decides he wants to hide under the pseudonym of clifford brown i'd imagine even the most die hard franco fan would have a hard time defending this thing the script by franco erm sorry i mean clifford brown julian esteban as julius valery who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product wanted his named removed is awful it's as simple straight forward as that for a start the film is so boring it's untrue the kidnap plot is one of the dullest i've ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved the horror side of things don't improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking over sized bloodshot eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes as a horror film sexo cannibal fails as an action adventure it has no more success this is one to avoid br br director franco shows his usual incompetence throughout a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try give the impression it's not attached to anything the cannibal scenes are poor the action is lame it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from 'a' to 'b' not really doing anything when they get there either it becomes incredibly dull tedious to watch after about 10 minutes don't forget this thing goes on for 94 minutes in it's uncut state i also must mention the hilarious scene when al cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff this is achieved by franco turning his camera on it's side having cliver crawl along the floor just look at the way his coat hangs the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along the gore isn't that great as far as euro cannibal films go this is very tame there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat a man is impaled on spikes there's some blood a handful of intestines there's a fair bit of nudity in sexo cannibal an unpleasant rape scene br br sexo cannibal must have had a low budget i mean low this is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects rock bottom production values the only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic the music sucks sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen the acting sucks the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can act br br sexo cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell the only good things i can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give sexo cannibal as wide a berth as possible one to avoid
<START> superb movie very good photography of 1969 70 bolton which seems now to be a different world thoughtful and an excellent dramatisation and production james mason a real first class star it is and i would agree with the above comment that this movie is a national treasure
<START> the movie is actually too slow there are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring you see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more it may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all though you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun to disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie video clips into the movie they are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it's really sad several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that's it beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music the director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost personally i cannot recommend the movie i believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring during the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review
<START> when marlene dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers it was films like the garden of allah how a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me br br the garden of allah one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911 12 it then got two silent screen adaptions the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french tunisia to see some of what he's missed in the world he runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent she's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train br br the woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer i'm not sure what was in david o selznick's mind in filming this story someone like ingrid bergman might have made it palatable for the audience but you can bet that the movie going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day salome rather than a saint with that title the public still remembered rudolph valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting br br as for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret the monastery will have to rethink it's economics if boyer leaves the monks are a sincerely pious group but from the head man charles waldron on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest br br anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts most especially marlene dietrich i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot
<START> with 'twelve monkeys' you need to pay attention but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate i know i did the story is interesting and deals with time traveling a virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named cole bruce willis is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus in 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital there he meets jeffrey goines brad pitt who probably has something to do with the virus he also meets psychiatrist dr kathryn railly madeleine stowe who doesn't believe him in 1990 when cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re appears in 1996 kathryn starts believing cole's stories br br the movie constantly plays with time cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996 it is picked up in the future and they send someone for cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention you could ask some questions but since you can't have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie br br 'twelve monkeys' works as sci fi with some great images and a dark atmosphere and it works as a thriller you are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie may be it has some flaws in the story but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy that was the easy part for me
<START> wow finally jim carrey has returned from the died this movie had me laughing and crying it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from jeniffer aniston was great she will finally have a hit movie under her belt if you liked liar liar you will love this movie i give it 9 10
<START> with this abc family attempt of the hit blockbuster cheaper by the dozen comes an obnoxious amount of corny dialogue shallow plot lines and cheesy comebacks with about two good actors among many wanna be's this movie was a major disappointment its a hollywood wannabe ditto of an already bad plot then because they needed a lot of actors that meant that they'd probably be more lenient so the acting wasn't five star the plot moved fairly fast and the twists were bad and had horrible timing the junction of characters and the end relationships were also too mushy and clichÃ©d for me spare yourself and rent something better
<START> i can't believe i am just now seeing this film i think perhaps i thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated and i avoided roots for the same reason just as i have yet to see schindler's list i don't want to be entertained by other peoples' pain not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be br br so i guess the main thing i noticed about the color purple was that it was not about black people being mistreated by whites the black people were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their husbands it was painful to watch but everyone redeemed himself in the end and the acting was phenomenal i couldn't believe the character oprah played at the age of 35 and i adore whoopi to start with she was amazing i'm so glad i was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and showtime was running the color purple
<START> considering the limits of this film the entire movie in one setting a music studio only about 5 or 6 actors total it should have been much better made if you have these limits in making a film how could the lighting be so bad and the actors were terrible were talking a hair below the acting in clerks except that was an enjoyable movie this had no substance well it tried to but really fails br br it makes attempt to be self referencing in a couple parts but the lines were delivered so poorly by the actors it was just bad and the main character neal guy what a pathetic looser clearly like 10 people total made this 'film' and they all knew each other and it probably was a real rock band that they had but unfortuntly these people really have no idea how terrible they are all around this was made in 2005 but they all look so naieve it smacks of just pre grunge era br br thankfully i didn't pay to see this starz on demand delivers again but it was under the title the possessed not studio 666 it doesn't matter what you do to the title it can't help this this could have been a much better made movie there is no excuse for this bad film making when you have the obvious limited parameters the filmmakers had when they made this working within those limits you should make the stuff you can control and the stuff you can work with the best you can instead they figured mediocrity would be good enough and that music video wow that was bad i fast fowarded through that br br so 2 10 is fair if you are into the whole b movie crap i suppose you'll go and see this
<START> this movie is utterly hilarious its cast clicks immediately with frame one and takes us on a wonderful ride through spoofing gangster films the conflict of brother vs brother appears when johnny's brother becomes a do gooder d a however the best character is johnny's crimelord rival the overly accented moroni as johnny says that man should be arrested for butchering the english language br br check it out on video it's worth a look
<START> hmmm yeah this episode is extremely underrated br br even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts i think the good over wins the bad br br i love the origami parts and the big 'twist' at the end i absolutely love that scene when michelle confronts tony it's actually one of my favorite scenes of season 1 br br for some reason people have always hated the reincarnation episodes yet i have always liked them they're not the best in terms of writing but the theme really does interest me br br i'm gonna give it a three star but if the writing were a little more consistent i'd give it four
