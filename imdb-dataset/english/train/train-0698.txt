<START> six gis about to be send home and discharged get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in asia surrounded by hooded figures two male dancers pretend to have a fight behind them on an altar a woven basket opens and a figure painted emerges and begins imitating a snake finally biting one of the dancers on the neck the imitation snake is dressed in some scaley looking body tights this is definitely a female imitation snake the cult member who has sneaked them into the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the ceremonies must not be interrupted and most definitely no photos must be taken or else they will be hunted down and killed naturally the gis take a flash photo send the cult members into an angry hysteria steal the basket containing the snake and run off with it into the asian night br br one of the guys the most offensive and snarky dies from a cobra bite on the neck though no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room br br back in new york it all seems rather old news as the discharged men settle down into their civilian lives still maintaining their bond with one another their jobs range from manager of a bowling alley david janssen to graduate research student richard long james dobson jack kelly and marshall thompson are also part of the neighborhood richard long has a nice blond girl friend kelly is a somewhat reckless womanizer but they all get along well enough and all of them seem happy br br then a dark shifty looking mysterious woman faith domergue shows up and marshall thompson takes a liking to her and insinuates her into the group br br guess what happens first janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash then kelly gets a visit from domergue something scares him so badly he tumbles through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk long and dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows that domergue has had something to do with the deaths they also reckon that maybe she's turning into a cobra which is the case dobson confronts her with his suspicions and she proves his point br br by this time long and thompson are thoroughly frazzled particularly thompson who is in love with domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him too although he must explain to her what love is no matter a final reckless attack by the cobra woman against long's girl friend not one of the six original offenders and thompson must throw the snake out the window on the pavement below the body changes to that of domergue the end br br i think i'll skip over most of the questions that the plot raises i'll just mention one of the more prosaic ones in passing who paid for domergue's fare from somewhere in asia to new york who's paying her utility bills in the hotel who paid for her spectacular wardrobe how come she speaks american english so well what the hell's going on the writers and director have clearly seen some of val lewton's modest horror films and though not much effort has gone into this production they've unashamedly stolen some gimmicks from lewton in lewton's the cat people for instance the woman is transformed into a black leopard but with one tiny exception the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it most of the transformations here use shadows too but unlike lewton's the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous br br lewton also made occasional use of what he called buses lewton's first bus was a literal one a potential victim is hurrying alone through the dark tunnels of central park with only the sound of footsteps something or someone is following her she freezes with fright under a street lamp something rustles the branches of the shrubs above her she looks upward there is a loud wheezing shriek that makes your hair stand on end it's a bus using its air brakes to stop for her the producers used at least two buses in this film and they amount to nothing a guy is walking distractedly across an intersection for instance and there is the sudden rumble of a truck that almost hits him there is no set up to the shot it's jammed in with a shoe horn br br i don't much care for movies that perpetuate the stereotype of serpents as slimy ugly venomous and phallic as a matter of fact no snakes are slimy most are harmless and many are extraordinarily beautiful furthermore they're more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and serpentine approach to goals you want a reptilian symbol for masculinity try a six lined racerunner it's a really fast lizard when it sees something to eat it rushes up and gobbles it down br br anyway if you want to see some fine low budget scary films don't bother with this one find the cat people or one of lewton's other minor masterpieces of which this is an obvious copy
<START> the comedic might of pryor and gleason couldn't save this dog from the tissue thin plot weak script dismal acting and laughable continuity in editing this mess together it has a very few memorable moments but the well dries up quickly as a kid i remember this as a luke warm vehicle for the two actor comedians but there was always something strange about the flow and feeling of what was being conveyed in each scene and how this ties to the plot overall watching it again after many years it screams schlock a mania i'm not so concerned with the racial controversy as i wouldn't mind seeing a movie take that issue on with a little levity the most obvious fault to me is that the scenes are laid out like a jumbled non related series of 2 minute situation comedy bits any not very good ones at that that were stapled together by the editor after an all nighter at the local watering hole characters change feelings and motivations on a dime without rhyme nor reason between scenes and within scenes making this feel as though no one had any idea of what to get out of the screenplay not that it was any gem to start with i feel bad for the two actors whose legacy is marred by this disaster that should never have been made maybe my sense of humor has become too refined
<START> this is one of those movies where i wish i had just stayed in the bar br br the film is quite frankly boring what story there is is very flimsy and you pretty much have to guess at it the film indulges itself with pretentious camera techniques that seem intent on causing migraines and makes it look like a student film did i say it was boring already if all the characters had suddenly died at the end of the movie i would not have cared less as i had no emotional attachment to any of them br br there are about 4 good minutes in this movie but that was about it this is the first time i have ever considered walking out of a cinema during a performance but i held on believing that it had to get better i was wrong br br the sort of film you could threaten naughty children with
<START> first of all in defense of joan fontaine it must be said that ginger rogers would have been terribly miscast as alyce the young british lady who has the title role fontaine makes a fetching picture as the heroine here but her acting inexperience shows badly and her dancing is better left unmentioned fortunately she went on to better things br br but here it's fred astaire george burns and gracie allen who get the top billing and they are excellent fans of burns allen will be surprised at how easily they fit into astaire's dance routines especially interesting is the big fun house routine that won choreographer hermes pans an oscar they join astaire in what has to be the film's most inventive highlight br br unfortunately not much can be said for the slow pacing of the story nor some of the stale situations which call for a lot of patience from the viewer it must be said that some of the humor falls flat and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any fred astaire film of this period are given conventional treatment only the musical interludes give the story the lift it needs br br some pleasant gershwin tunes pop up once in awhile but not all of them get the treatment they deserve the nice supporting cast includes reginald gardiner at his best in a polished comic performance as a conniving servant constance collier and montagu love as joan's father mistaken as a gardener by astaire br br it's a lighthearted romp whenever burns allen are around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days both of them are surprisingly adept in keeping up with astaire's footwork br br director george stevens makes sure that joan fontaine's hillside dance number with fred is filmed at a discreet distance but clever camera work cannot disguise the fact that she is out of her element as astaire's dance partner something she seems painfully aware of
<START> that's what the title should be anyway br br this movie combines guns explosives and mindless killing to make one flop of an action movie let me make my point in a series of questions answers type deal br br what happens in the movie people die br br is that it yes br br what is the plot about what plot br br what is the point the movie is trying to make killing is the only solution br br what are the characters like extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalities br br is there anything good about this movie yes i'm sure they used some nice panavision cameras in filming it br br if you like constant killing and greed then watch the movie if you happen to be repulsed by such low standard entertainment then made men is not for you br br to sum it up the plotline stinks the characters aren't worth their while the storyline is completely resistable and nothing fits together br br this proves one thing the actors directors and whoever helped make this movie certainly aren't made
<START> i was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons for the first half hour it's actually pretty decent although the acting isn't any better then that which you would find in a rap video its kinda funny and the production value doesn't seem half bad in fact i almost thought this would be almost as good as perico ripiao another recent dominican film which turned out to be much much better than i expected the plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in dominican society as a whole which makes for a good premise especially in the dominican republic unfortunately i don't think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter and they f'ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them about 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge space age cgi effects dating to what i'm guessing would be the 70's but the whole plot just goes down the drain the rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations and clever one liners to top it all off and i guess i should warn you now spoiler alert it all turns out to be a dream oh my who didn't see that coming oh man i almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie well after about an hour into it i start thinking Âhmmmm something just doesn't seem right about the sound track but what can it be Âand then it hits me half of the music in the movie was taken from a video game called king of fighter 95 br br when oh when dr will you give us a film we can call a work of art perhaps a comedy to match france's amelie or an action flick to match thailand's ong bak an animation as akira was to japan a witty crime thriller as layer cake was to england or a socio awakening journey as waking life had here in the states br br i would give it a 1 but i've seen much worse come out of dr search los jodedores and you'll know what i'm talking about
<START> compelling and innovative at the beginning of this criminally underrated whoopi goldberg flick the writers draw a parallel between theodore rex and the 1941 orson welles classic citizen kane the writers are justified in drawing such a seemingly disparate parallel but the viewing public is too often hoodwinked into seeing overly hyped hollywood schlock to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two movies in citizen kane charles foster kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his underlings much like whoopi goldberg in this movie this movie is about finding love in everybody's differences it is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self absorption whoever paired whoopi goldberg and theodore rex formulated a dyad for the ages with the only justifiable comparisons being bogey and bacall hepburn and tracy and hall and oates if you would love to watch an uplifting celluloid philosophical examination of some of humanity's deepest drives bergman esqe but not as depressing theodore rex should be viewed immediately
<START> this particular episode of smallville is probably the best episode to air since reunion this is for many reasons for example it takes the series back to some of it's roots it welcomes back lionel from a supposedly long absence with the luthorcorp plaza office in metropolis this room hasn't been in smallville for a very long time and seeing it again brings back many memories from the smallville's past not to mention lionels conversations with lex are always admirable br br another pleasant return is well uv guessed it is bart allen aka impulse ac aka aquaman and victor stone aka cyborg not only does steven deknight reunite the former justice leaguers he blends them in with the smallville formula in such a unique way that it almost feels like it is a feature length movie br br from there you get the basic story green arrow forms the league attempts to blow up 33 1 bart gets captured clark saves him and the facility is blown to kingdom com all is good and graceful with a good mix of stealth action pace and suspense oh and cyborg has some cool new upgrades true to the justice league character br br the music is probably what makes this episode work so well if you remember correctly the first episode steven deknight directed was agless from season 4 this was a mediocre episode but something felt out of place maybe it was the music or the acting or the fact clark sais at the end we didn't find you you found us kind of made people lose faith in the formula but thankfully steve deknight redeemed himself in this justice episode br br i had a few quivvles about justice that made it fall short of the full 10 first of all the far too cheesy exit of the justice league from the ridge facility expolsion i mean it would have been soo much cooler if say green arrow and cyborg took off on oliver's bike rememeber from the arrow episode clark and impulse should have obviously ran and aquaman should have swam via another route but that was soo incredibly cheesy it nocked off 2 points from the full 10 br br secondly another cheesy moment not as bad as the first but when green arrow sais let's go save the world that made me cringe all in all judging by the acting performances music direction and production values the pros do outweigh the cons and this is still one of the best episodes in smallville history and maybe the 2nd best episode in season 6 br br 7 out of 10
<START> few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as fire has the movie is pretentious garbage it does not achieve anything at an artistic level the only thing it managed to receive is a ban in india if only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy the ban would have been more justifiable br br now that i've got my distress out of my system i am more able to analyse the movie br br from the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in english the director of course did not make the movie for an indian audience however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect english is too unreal to be true br br next we get regular glimpses into radha's dreams these scenes are not very effective they coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie i'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story i felt that the surrealism was lost br br the love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement in any case they do not achieve either of the two br br the names chosen for the women radha and sita are names of hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences however since the film wasn't meant for indian audiences in the first place the shock through name selection is not meant to achieve its goal which is absurd br br the quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled a better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject br br the acting felt wooden although nandita das brought some life into the role the others were wasted i always thought that shabana azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film the male leads were outright rubbish br br in case you are a fan of earth and wish to see more of the director stay away from this one please
<START> made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this film in the edinburgh film festival it was well shot from the outset but that's the last positive comment i have about the film the acting was awful i wonder if actual gogo girls were hired but it was the plot that was truly laughable in fact that it was laughable and not boring is the only reason i gave this 3 10 br br spoilers below br br i just want to mention a few of the scenes that really got the audience laughing br br shoving the girl in the field who would have thought that a kid shoving another kid could be acted so badly a real eye opener br br the getting on the bus scene the girl is getting on the bus but according to the music the world is ending br br the rolling under the clothes line wow this one really demonstrates the plot writer's skills in the room followed by raw meat and skill selling why not just get her to perform all three 'sins' at once at least then the film might have been slightly shorter br br the running down the stairs of the mall watch as one of the girls takes to flight down the stairs pursued by a flesh eating dau no wait she is just walking quickly trying not to break her nails br br the running covered in blood this is definitely my favourite scene and a fitting end to the movie a half marathon in red paint completed by vaulting up stairs and over the bridge only to be sent flying most unrealistically by a passing car not only this but this suicide is undertaken by the most self obsessed girl in the film now that's sticking to character for you br br i'd like to think that this film was created by a 16 year old and their mates sadly having met the director at the presentation this is not the case br br but if you're in a sarcastic mood and fancy a laugh with a few mates then still don't even think about it
<START> and i'll tell you why whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was very ill advised everything concerning drugs is cut out and covered up how do they do it you might ask well they don't do it very well that's for sure anyway instead of the marijuana which cheech and chong are supposed to have in their possession they are said to have diamonds still the characters go around in a haze of marijuana smoke stoning others along their way with no explanation whatsoever
<START> wilson erica gavin is nabbed by the cops and sent to prison in this slick and amusing example of prime 70's exploitation marking the directing debut of jonathan demme after writing and producing a few of mentor roger cormans' new world films demme was afforded the opportunity to direct for the first time and he delivers a movie that not only delivers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence but has an appealing tongue in cheek quality to it as well it's often as funny as it is flashy br br standout scenes include a lewd and crude vaudeville style act performed for the prisoners as well as a potent dream fantasy sequence for uptight and obviously very repressed superintendent mcqueen horror icon barbara steele doing a marvelous turn in this antagonistic role i also enjoyed a bank robbery scene gone haywire and a carjacking scene that was simply uproarious as in other movies of this kind it's also commendable that it's as much a portrait of female empowerment as it is pure exploitation these women are tough they take no garbage from anybody and they're more than capable of handling themselves br br our attractive cast here makes the most of their roles juanita brown as the aggressive maggie roberta collins as the sassy belle rainbeaux smith as the cute and timid lavelle gavin as the wide eyed newcomer and lynda gold a k a crystin sinclaire in a bright appearance as an accomplice on the outside br br as our climax plays out demme comes up with a tense beat the clock finish as our heroines race to save belle from being lobotomized by predatory dr randolph warren miller the type of man who thinks nothing of taking advantage of women br br bouncing along to john cales' flavorful score caged heat is upbeat entertainment and a guaranteed good time br br 8 10
<START> our imp of the perverse did good his first time out thats for sure the music is the best you may ever hear by any human but you already know that unless you have no taste or have a brain that is too small to understand greatness a poor script that doesn't flesh out much of a story but at least it has its moments the breathtaking concert stuff is worth seeing it he deserved an oscar for this s t even though he was at times an ego driven twit with his towering bodyguard chick huntsbery always in front a movie that made non fans fans take it or leave it prince does need to stay clear of acting in the future though he takes himself way to serious he is a genius musician but pleaseee just enjoy the ride my purple maestro peace
<START> the script is so so laughable this in turn makes the actors' lines sound stiff and unrealistic and not to be believed there's repetition of phrases my sweet little god daughter and minor variations of that line which comes to mind and it's just sloppy soap opera dialog br br worse yet the music is so wrong plus the main bluesy theme is horribly quaint and entirely wrong for this and it feels overused mostly because the instrumentation texture and arrangement of this theme never changes even when the scene's emotional context does br br subsequently whenever it appears it sticks out like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another br br the music's corny and it's as if the writer were writing music for a soap or a sitcom a low budget 80's canadian sitcom at that and this makes it feel as if we're always on the brink of throwing to a commercial br br this is so miscast there's a lot of overacting and it's a real stretch that so many of these characters are employing only one type of ny accent a thick bronx accent i don't know if it's a question of the actors' limited capacity in only knowing one ny accent or whether it's a question of the director's ability to notice such an glaring anomaly br br in the end it's the amateur script with it's leaden lines which makes this entire movie blow when any foundation is shaky and unstable it's impossible to build upon it without it's flaws revealing themselves in exponentially more damaging and unflattering ways
<START> wow i'm shocked to learn that it's a small world and that we are all interconnected what a waste of 88 minutes john dunne put it much better in one sentence no man is an island the acting wasn't bad the kids gave it all they had but at times the thread got so thin i couldn't follow it and the only real hero in the film ends up in jail after being tormented by a meter maid i don't know i just don't get it oh well
<START> watch on the rhine started as a broadway play by lillian hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous non aggression pact signed in august of 1939 so much for the fact that hellman was merely echoing the communist party line the line didn't change until a couple of months later lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work br br the play watch on the rhine ran from april 1941 to february 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler eric roberts as the youngest son lucile watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain george coulouris and paul lukas br br lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an oscar a golden globe and the new york film critics for best actor probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against humphrey bogart for casablanca gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls mickey rooney in the human comedy and walter pidgeon for madame curie every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was lukas's nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a field br br jack warner knew that which is why mady christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of lukas's wife was given to bette davis davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it it's the same reason she did the man who came to dinner a much lighter play than this one br br davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the weimar days after many years of being vagabonds on the continent of europe davis lukas and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war they're made welcome by lucile watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren br br the fly in this ointment are some other house guests a friend of davis's from bygone days geraldine fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe a rumanian diplomat and aristocrat george coulouris coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects lukas's anti fascist background br br his suspicions are quite correct it's the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they've become lukas fought in spain on the republican side and was wounded there his health has not been the same since his family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes those decisions affect all the other members of the cast br br adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was dashiell hammett who was lillian hellman's significant other coulouris playing cards at the german embassy was a hammett creation with such loathsome types as henry daniell kurt katch clyde fillmore erwin kalser and rudolph anders br br coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account runmanian count he was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after stalingrad br br lucile watson was up for best supporting actress in 1943 but lost to katina paxinou in for whom the bell tolls dashiell hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other anti fascist classic casablanca br br though it's an item firmly planted in those specific times watch on the rhine still packs a stern anti fascist message that bears repeating infinitely
<START> slaughter high is a totally ridiculous slasher flick about a high school nerd marty who gets pick on all the time by some pranksters the prank goes wrong and he ends up getting savagely burned five years later his tormentors all attend a reunion just the ten of them of course and low and behold marty murders them one after another british actress caroline munro maniac leads the cast as the heroine who dies anyway the acting is completely awful there's also no suspense at all plenty of grotesque death scenes to satisfy the gore freaks a guy's stomach explodes another female victim literally gets an acid bath a couple having sex in bed get electrocuted a guy is crushed by a tractor one girl is drowned and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye the killer wears a decent and rather creepy jester's mask and the setting a beautiful old english castle is really nice however the dream finale is utterly pathetic all in all it's true that slaughter high is a piece of garbage but i enjoyed it only for fans of truly bad slasher flicks
<START> nobody said movies had to be realistic did they i really liked this movie because i remember when i first saw it in junior high for all the kids who remember the pmrc and albums before there were warning stickers it's a cool story for all those kids who were part of the mid to late 80's headbanger crowd
<START> quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom br br a group of top quality actors in the main well cast with a couple of notable exceptions who give pretty good performances penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna lumley as diana all do well with the scripts they were given br br so much for the good the average would include the sets nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book although bizarrely the house they use for the dower house looks remarkably like it it is clear then that the dower house is far too big in the later parts the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk presumably to save money although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have recreated ceylon br br now to the bad the screenplay this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives blinded he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide why loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible farmer's wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear less emotional than brief encounter gus a man besotted and passionately in love is prepared to give up his love without complaint walter mudge in the book turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't speak aunt biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification the dower house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers whilst miss mortimer's breasts are utterly delightful i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward the delightfully named nettlebed becomes the mundane dobson the word limit prevents me from continuing the list br br there is a sequel which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story it is difficult to image that rosamunde pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased
<START> this movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space as a history of space flight it is still used today in classrooms that can get one of the rare prints of it disney has shown it on vault disney and i wish they would do so again
