<START> the cover on the dvd and disc is freaking awesome you would think they made a movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black which is still a really great idea but this movie's actors are worst then ben's performance in pearl harbor porno's have better quality and better actors i was gonna buy the dvd but luckily i rented it first the plot and script are also horrible nothing seems to go to together so the movie really never makes sense the poor attempts to frighten you using flashback scenes are worse then ones used in 80's sitcom shows and in the end it'll leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your house
<START> what a huge pile of dung shot on video really crappy camcorder not digital pile of garbage it is without a doubt the stupidest thing ever made the fact that this crap was actually released is completely asanine everyone who sees it will become stupider for having watched it seriously i felt like it killed several brain cells after i watched this garbage the positive reviews of this a crap were obviously made by the filmmaker and i use the term very loosely himself and or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like this waste of life trust me stay the hell away from this video you'll thank me for it avoid it like herpes
<START> first this is a review of the two disc set that came together with the wonderland dvd rental br br the two movies included with the rental wonderland and the johnny wadd documentary totally obliterate the myth created by boogie nights that myth being that the characters involved in the adult movie trade were considerably more than slimy lowlifes that would do anything for money basically denying that they were anything other than detestable self centered whores this is amazingly similar to what the book wiseguy and the movie goodfellas did to the godfather fable and most of the rest of the gangster romanticism lore br br now what irritated me most while watching these movies and will probably irk anyone who saw and liked boogie nights is how foolish and gullible supposedly educated and sophisticated people can be dirk diggler in boogie nights is without a doubt john holmes who unlike dirk diggler had no redeeming quality holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused anyone close to him was totally consumed by his quest for self gratification and was without a doubt a key participant in the brutal murders on wonderland avenue in los angeles in 1981 the movie lays bare the big lie that boogie nights was and reinforces the linda lovelace description of the cruel and pathetic business that is known as the adult film entertainment industry this should be required viewing both features on the wonderland dvd for anyone who had any positive opinions on the story in the movie boogie nights
<START> i recently got the chance to view the waterdance and quite liked it i don't really understand why its called that as there isn't really any dancing going on there except maybe for the dancing at the strip club near the end we are introduced to the main characters throughout the movie invalids in a hospital the story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman which is a very sweet story unfortunately you don't get to see movies like that today im not stuck in a time warp im not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today but i really think the movie industry is deteriorating and there's much we can learn from old movies by old movies i mean anything from 1920 1998
<START> grand epic as it is kenneth branagh's monumental rendering of what is perhaps william shakespeare's most popular tragedy suffers under the weight of its four hour playing time and certainly takes some real staying power two entirely separate sittings would most likely be better in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high class film making while i absolutely acknowledge this masterpiece as such i must confess to a lack of enthusiasm for the old bards flamboyance his rhetoric and he sends himself up so well and his many flourishes thus hamlet loses its impact as it loses its grip br br from patrick doyle's music to alex thomson's cinematography to tim harvey's exquisite sets the movie is a feast of visual and aural delights which compliments a fine cast branagh has taken on three huge mantels adapting directing and playing his adaptation is superb his direction strong but by the time he got to the role of hamlet the strain seemed to be showing yet still he does a fine job in what is an incredibly taxing role derek jacobi gobbles up the sinister claudius with glee and julie christie is most dramatic as his queen gertrude richard briers is marvellous as polonius and charlton heston is once again a strong screen influence as the player king many others drop by including jack lemmon superb in a very small role billy crystal dame judi dench sir john mills sir john gielgud sir richard attenborough and gerard depardieu the acting prize though must go to one of the great thespian discoveries of recent years kate winslet hers is a moving portrayal of the most tragic figure in this whole affair ophelia br br to finish before this review goes on longer than the film i must say it is the length that really tests the viewer in this movie branagh has directed with purpose giving many important impacting scenes too many of them outstay their welcome watching this film holds a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we have garnered from it neither a lender nor a borrower be or be true to thyself and of course to be or not to be br br the opening two hours does take some perseverance but if you do manage to stay tuned you are sure to be treated to a rousing finale which gathers momentum from the tragic funeral onward br br monday june 8 1998 hoyts croydon
<START> this movie is very hilarious and it has a great compilation of actors like william h macy which always have perform this kind of roles maybe his most representative fargo and george clooney which is a very good actor showing his comedian work in brothers cohen film oh brother where art thou which results to be one of my favorite movies ever but it's been hard to find welcome to collinwood here in mexico my city lacks of good places where to buy some good films i tried to buy it at blockbuster but they don't know it by the original name so maybe it will be a little easier to find if i have the name they gave to it in mexico do someone knows it because i can't remember cheers a
<START> when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors it was one of many movies i watched with my parents but this was the only one we walked out of since then i had never seen interiors until just recently and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it what a pretentious ponderous and painfully boring piece of 70's wine and cheese tripe woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career in the unmistakable style of ingmar berman allen gives us a dark angular muted insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce estrangement career love non love halitosis whatever the film intentionally has no comic relief no music and is drenched in shadowy pathos this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a more pronounced depth of meaning and truth but woody allen is no ingmar bergman the film is painfully slow and dull but beyond that i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling whining nicotine stained martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes everyone is lost and struggling desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them it's never about resolution it's only about interminable introspective babble it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience's ability to connect woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance i highly recommend this one if you're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death otherwise let's just pretend this film never happened
<START> i watched the pie lette last night and the word that comes to mind is original it is a word not used much in tv as they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows unfunny comedies and reality crap br br the first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of jim dale those not familiar with the british carry on series or those who have not listened to a harry potter book may not be familiar with dale i am not sure whether his presence as narrator adds or distracts i will have to tune in more but it does give the show a harry potter atmosphere maybe that's a good thing br br lee pace infamous the white countess has a gift it never explains where he got it but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute he teams with chi mcbride boston public roll bounce to solve murders using this talent everything is fine and funny until he comes across a childhood love anna friel goal the dream begins timeline and things really get complicated he can't send her back and he can never touch her boy would that make a relationship difficult br br i will be tuning in to see where this series goes in the expectation that it will continue to entertain
<START> we're a long way from laura once again otto preminger directs dana andrews stars as a police detective named mark and gene tierney is the beautiful woman who haunts him but nothing else about where the sidewalk ends resembles everyone's favorite sophisticated murder mystery instead of deliciously quotable dialogue we get gritty harrowing realism while the earlier film took place in the ritzy upper echelons of new york society here we're in the low rent district of dark streets hoodlums cheap restaurants and crummy flats tierney gorgeous as ever now works as a department store mannequin and lives in washington heights the neighborhood of the doll who once got a fox fur out of laura's mark mcpherson this time andrews is mark dixon an older sadder more troubled version of the cool cop in a trench coat br br where the sidewalk ends belongs to a sub genre of noir movies about police brutality focusing on cops who can't control their violent impulses like kirk douglas's character in detective story dixon owes his seething contempt for crooks to his father's criminal past where douglas is self righteous and blind to his own faults andrews is burdened by repressed guilt and self loathing he accidentally kills a suspect and covers up his actions with an attempt to throw suspicion on a slimy gangster gary merrill whom he has been vainly pursuing for years instead a kindly cab driver is suspected because he's the father of the dead man's estranged and mistreated wife morgan gene tierney dixon falling in love with the wife of the man he killed tries desperately to save her father without giving himself away br br among noir protagonists dana andrews had this distinction he was incapable of appearing unintelligent even when playing an average joe as he usually did he always comes across as unusually sensitive and perceptive more than that his air of being too thoughtful for his own comfort gives him that haunted and haunting quality that was his essence as an actor he played ordinary guys cops and soldiers but always with a tragic undercurrent of seeing and knowing too much his conscientious heroes are marked by exhaustion guilt the inability ever to lighten up no other actor could have expressed so well the bottled up anger the slow burning pain the agonized intelligence of mark dixon he also has a muted tenderness a muffled warmth and even wry humor that make him heartbreaking this comes out when he takes morgan to a restaurant where he's a regular and for the first time we see this cold brutal man trading mock insults with the waitress whose sarcasm can't hide her affection and concern for him when dixon asks his partner for money to get a lawyer for morgan's father he supplies it even though they recently argued and dixon threw a punch at him there are no words about loyalty or knowing he's a good guy deep down but we see it all in the man's anguished silence and his wife's resignation as she hands over some jewelry to pawn dixon's goodness comes across through other people's reactions to him as much as through andrews's deeply moving performance br br though dana andrews was a minor star he may be the quintessential forties man he goes through some movies hardly ever taking off his overcoat with that boxy mid century silhouette further fortified by the fedora the glass of bourbon the cigarette he doesn't take out of his mouth when he talks he looks imprisoned in the masculine ideal of toughness and impassivity while many noirs romanticize the two fisted tough guy where the sidewalk ends offers an unflinching portrait of the reality behind the faÃ§ade a gripping and melancholy exploration of the roots and consequences of violence br br andrews was sadly underrated in his own time he was the only one of the three protagonists in the best years of our lives not nominated for an academy award though his low key performance is far more compelling than frederic march's hammy oscar winning drunk fortunately andrews appeared in some films that ensured his immortality and now at last this little known film which contains his best performance can be seen as part of the marvelous fox film noir set this series including a number of never before released titles such as nightmare alley and thieves' highway suggests that twentieth century fox may have had the finest record of all the major studios when it came to film noir
<START> i have absolutely no knowledge of author phillipa pearce or any of her novels and if tom s midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her books as a child when i was a child i wasn t really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count br br judging by this film version of tom s midnight garden i guess pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didn t have in the 1950s so i guess there s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere there s also a romance involving a young girl called hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative br br this is a childrens film that seems dated by its source it s inoffensive but i m surprised by its high rating by the imdb voters i wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were 10 year olds who d just seen the lord of the rings trilogy
<START> this is actually a groovy neat little flick made on absolutely no discernible budget with shot on video crinkliness it takes a little while to warm up to it the acting is so bad that it soon acquires a zen like charm after a few scenes you stop noticing the awkward lines or rehearsed sound of some deliveries the characters all develop a quirky charm especially richard forget anthony hopkins maidens is the guy i'd hire to play a raving psychopath he just seems to enjoy it so very much mixed in with the scenes of mad slasher gore and zombie infestation are some truly visually effective shots of the title character the midnight skater zooming through the campus in a black hoodie looking for all the world like a cross between the grim reaper and say the silver surfer these shots make the sometimes ludicrous things the characters say about the skater seem almost ominous the soundtrack features some very fun garage punk tunes and the raspy raucous meanness of it meshes well with the film's mood thumbs upish i say
<START> i might not have been the biggest blair witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort so i was looking forward to altered especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various imdb comments unique intelligent a future cult classic and so on you gotta wonder where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor effort br br because alas altered is a poor weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect the silliness is not funny the horror and gore is not scary and whatever thinking aspect some poor fellows saw in this movie were due to severe delusions because there's certainly nothing profound or smart about this mess br br ok so we know nothing stands out is it at least bearable is the experience worthwhile in any way unfortunately no for starters get very poor acting it's not a stretch to say most b movies these days feature better acting the plot boring and messy dialogs many amateurs actually do better br br it's really the direction that puzzles i did not expect major improvements over blair witch but at least small steps forward instead our director seems to have worsen over time completely oblivious to previous experiences br br if there is a major flaw in altered it's the main set a major part of the plot takes place in a single location where the main characters are confined but sÃ¡nchez has failed to give the place any personality whatsoever considering that in blair witch the forest plays a major part and is as much a character an antagonist if you will as the three students you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here but no this place has no personality whatsoever thanks to sloppy direction and no attention to details br br there's nothing salvageable here die hard fans of blair witch are better off following daniel myrick although his output is far from being golden it shows better structure than sÃ¡nchez and some lessons from blair witch are applied unfortunately in weak stories but still

<START> i just finished watching el otro i have always taken my hat off to julio chavez's performances as he is a great actor but this movie is really depressing and slow i guess that it would have been even worse if it wasn't for julio anyways this is definitely a film that you will never understand if you are not from argentina and even if you are i would advise you not to rent this movie in order to have a nice time with your girlfriend boyfriend family or friends it is really depressing and incredibly slow and the plot does not make a lot of sense neither probably the director wanted to show the fragility of the human life but what he does is bore and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little bit it gives you something to think about but not in a good way overall i definitely didn't like this movie
<START> ahh the dull t v shows and pilots that were slammed together in the 70's to make equally dull t v movies some examples would be riding with death the most hysterically cheesy of the lot stranded in space confusing and uninteresting san francisco international horribly dull and unbelievably confusing and this turgid bit of quinn martin glamor br br shot in hawaii although you wouldn't know it from the outside shots it's apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show the real problem is that you don 't like most of the characters including the drab main character diamond head who seemed half asleep for the entire movie his boss 'aunt mary' who had a really weird delivery of his lines and shellacked white hair as well as the a tan that looked like it had been stuccoed on diamnd head's girlfriend fellow agent hell i can't even remember her name a skinny wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting and the singing sidekick zulu again i can't remember his character's name who wasn't bad in small doses the most interesting person in the whole production was ian mcshane who sucked as a bad guy but still proved his acting chops alothugh the make up jobs this so called 'chameleon' used to disguise himself were just laughable i have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that caused him to dress as a south american dictator cum american general nor do i care the plot simply wasn't interesting enough to hold your attention for even ten minutes at a time let alone the hour and a half or so it goes on just call this one hawaii five no
<START> please do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this movie just don't especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you damn cheek if you ask me i waited for something to happen it never did i am not one of those people to stop watching a movie part way through i always have to see it through to the end what a huge mistake do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry far more entertaining please do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this movie just don't especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you damn cheek if you ask me i waited for something to happen it never did i am not one of those people to stop watching a movie part way through i always have to see it through to the end what a huge mistake do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry far more entertaining
<START> this is the film in antonioni's middle period that most critics dismiss quickly as a 'flawed' look at 60s american youth culture politics for what it's worth i found it more touching and memorable than his more acclaimed films like l'avventura perhaps because he shows more emotion empathy here than anywhere else the story is simple but it is used as a frame for antonioni's brilliant observations of and critique on american consumerist culture student life the counter culture and the whole anti establishment anti war backlash that was so prominent then br br even from a purely technical point of view it is a remarkably crafted film from the opening credits sequence to the bizarre desert 'love in' to the use of billboards and right down to that jaw dropping cathartic finale that used 17 camera set ups in it's own way as powerful as the climax of the wild bunch also antonioni chose one hell of a leading lady with daria halperin one of the most beautiful ever to grace the screen there isn't much 'acting' involved as this feels more like a docu drama and so the use of non professionals as the lead couple works quite effectively within that context and the soundtrack is not only filled with marvelous music its use is impressive as well i can't forget the start of the film mostly due to the selection of music by pink floyd that grooms the visuals so well br br contrary to popular opinion this is quite an achievement in cinema and one i would enthusiastically recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the off beat well worth seeking out and one of those key films of the 60s that demands a dvd restoration release
<START> paul verhoeven's de vierde man the fourth man is one of the most compelling thrillers i have ever seen it really was a pleasant surprise the story concerns bi sexual writer gerard jeroen krabbe as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser christine renÃ©e soutendijk but in the twisted mind of gerard there could be more to the story verhoeven and cinematographer jan de bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and sickening sexual imagery this really pulls you into the story you don't want to watch but you can't turn yourself away this is by far verhoeven's best film maybe second only to robocop true the fourth man isn't for everyone some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous just ignore them but trust me if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be hooked this is one of those films that you need to know how it ends a true whodunit it in the hitchcock tradition compelling controversial and thrilling i even like the spider metaphor br br 8 10
<START> ok needless to say this film is only going to appeal to a certain audience namely stoners and like minded people br br that being said if you are one of these aformentioned people this film is a must in fact i think it should be mandatory for head shops to sell a copy of it to anyone purchasing their first bong what monty python's holy grail is to geeks and nerds so is this movie to potheads i first saw this film 10 years ago or so and i still crack up every time i watch it the jokes perfectly lampoon the pothead lifestyle far better than latter day knockoffs like half baked attempt to br br there isn't a plot so to speak the film is more of a collection of various skits as the films protagonists wander around los angeles in their legendary haze despite this the film has an excellent sense of pace and doesn't drag at all many people cite up in smoke as c c's best work but i would have to say that next movie is superior br br so if you're in the mood for an hour and half of belly laughs light up tune in and let your mind float away br br oh and free tommy chong
<START> i really tried to like this movie but in the end it just didn't work for me i have seen most of kitamura's output and have found it to be very variable alive like all of his films has an interesting plot some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity however these qualities are in painfully short supply in alive the plot is cool if not all that original and could have made for a pretty ace film unfortunately the pacing is painfully slow and the film takes an age to get going before reaching fairly predictable places the action is just about passable with the final fight pretty cool and the earlier one about ok the earlier one is also marred by overspeedy camera work making for less coherency there are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue but the film still drags badly the characters are neither well fleshed out nor well acted and the setting and general color scheme is drab and boring the film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest perhaps judicious use of the fast forward button could improve it with about twenty minutes taken off the run time this could be a pretty decent sci fi thriller but the full length film is dull only recommended to very patient and determined kitumura fans
