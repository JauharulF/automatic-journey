<START> here we go with other slasher movie good looking people and acting from everyone was really good br br few kids playing pranks phones calls and there parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids 20 years after they are still friends they go to huge house have fun drugs and sex no nudity for least half a hour of the movie again they start making pranks phone call all over again and then killer comes back kills them off one by one and killer is in big black coat with axe just like urban legend movie br br deaths scene really weird really odd times too br br nice slasher movie at this part would gave 7 10 but the twist at the end of the movie made the whole movie kinda of pointless br br the twist killed the movie for me so i going to give it 4 10
<START> this film is riveting but in much the same way a car crash is riveting it's hard to look away overall this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment and a futile biased experiment at that the filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problems going for the lowest possible denominator the manner in which the money is presented to ted is pure exploitation the intervening steps that the filmmakers force ted to participate in meeting with so called experts were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with ted instead it's painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker's posteriors and to further exploit ted's situation the worst part is that the filmmakers stop following ted after 6 months and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject they had followed so closely months before if they had cared they would have found better experts to help ted if they truly wanted to see what ted would do then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention this film is at best a high brow jackass stunt and not a documentary it's sad to think how much 100 000 could have actually changed a homeless person's life had it been put in the right hands
<START> first time director tom kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting dark comedy shot on a shoestring budget yet had the flavor of the early coen brother's film blood simple and throw in some monty python flavorings to boot needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next expect more good things to come from this writer director actor
<START> the title is the sound that one of the characters makes as he drives his imaginary trolley across the garbage dump where the characters live the film is based on a series of stories by shugoro yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who effectively live in ramshackle homes on the edge of the dump it's a mix of laughter and sadness br br first color film made by akria kurasowa has been something i've wanted to see for a long time weirdly it was often listed as being only available in a shortened version from a three or four hour original due to an error in the run time in some promotional material i was holding out for the full version waiting to see what kurasowa wanted us to see only to find out on the recent release by criterion that the 140 minute version is the full version br br finally sitting down to see the film last night i'm of mixed emotions about the film first and foremost its visually linked to every film that followed you can see every other of kurasowals remaining six films reflected in this movie down to the painted sunsets its a striking film in its use of color and you can understand why it took him so long to a film stock he would he happy with of course there are failed projects as well the film is a visual work of art though be warned if you're going to see this on your widescreen tv this was shot 1 33 so will appear in normal tv ratio the rest of the film is a mixed bag part of the problem is that the lives of all of these people don't quite come together as separate tales they all work well but as a filmic whole they don't hang as one i don't blame kurasowa since one can't always hit things out of the box especially when some one like robert altman who specialized in multi character films of this sort occasionally bombed himself br br this isn't to say that there aren't reasons to see the film as will all kurasowa films there are always reasons to see his films whether they work or not the first trip of the trolley is one of the best things kurasowa ever did and is worth the price of a rental its one of the most magical moments in film history as the trolley is inspected and taken out the father and son living in the car is touching though ultimately very sad and there are other bits and pieces that shine like the cast which is across the board great and one should at least try the film as something different from a man we usually associated with samurai films or crime dramas br br its an intriguing misfire from a master filmmaker which means in this case means its better than most other filmmakers successes br br between 6 and 7 as a whole much higher in pieces
<START> creepshow 2 is the ill fated sequel to the george romero's overrated original creepshow any sequel following a romero film that's not directed by romero himself has got some large shoes to fill mostly because of the romero fans out there who think he's god i didn't care much for the first film and funny enough i didn't care much for the sequel the film series had so much potential but it was short lived because both films were less than stellar br br the biggest problem with creepshow 2 was that it only had three stories excluding the in between story and because the first story sucked beyond belief it only left the chance for almost half of the movie to be really good i saw cs 2 at the movies and the first segment was a real groaner anything dramatic with george 'i can't act' kennedy is automatically doomed and the indian statue story was too hokey and simply didn't belong in this sequel so after a really trite and dull start there were only two other stories left to reverse the fiasco of the aborted beginning and unfortunately the two other stories weren't great enough for me to forget the first story the raft and the hitchhiker are moderately successful moderately because though the two other segments have their moments they still sorta fall flat the two last stories are basically stretched out for too long it's not that i wanted the stories to happen at a dizzying pace and end fast but both good ideas found within those stories were sorta nullified by the fact that they were slow and padded and eventually fell flat when the segments needed to be more energized more erratic and with punchier endings also if the two last stories hadn't been stretched out to pad the movie or had all three segments been more brief with better editing and direction they could have added a much needed fourth story to the bunch having only three padded segments made for a boring feast br br the acting and writing in both the raft and the hitchhiker segments are from awful to good i like lois chiles in the last segment it's probably her best moment on screen aside from her role as bond girl holly goodhead in moonraker and in death on the nile but even her role is difficult to understand at times because of the serviceable direction and the unfocused story are we supposed to hate her or sympathize with her are we supposed to sympathize with the annoying hitchhiker if the hitchhiker's body was found by other people on the road what was he when he attacked chiles was he a ghost or a zombie or what how did the body eventually left the presence of the other people who found him dead in order to attack chiles the whole thing is not very clear even for a supernatural story and the ending is rather dull and uneventful br br as for the infamous the raft story well the acting is mostly on the awful side and none of the characters are sympathetic or interesting the characters would have been more interesting had the actors played themselves none of the actors are convincing in their specific roles paul satterfield looks smarter than the dumb jock he's playing and the actress who plays his girlfriend is not very convincing as the typical bitchy slut she seems too timid the same could be said with the two others who play the plain teens the idea of the killer oil slick is interesting and creepy but not well executed there should have been a fifth character to the story maybe a homeless man or a ranger who lurks around the lake and knows about the oil slick and could have been the watery monster's alter ego of sorts as creepy as the oil slick is it doesn't make for a compelling character and the way the story ends everything seems pointless no punch to it whatsoever br br except for the few titillating aspects which always seems to make boring things worthwhile seeing creepshow 2 at a theater was basically a waste of money and time cs 2 is more rental material than something you pay to see on the big screen
<START> follow up to 1973's walking tall continues the real life drama surrounding tennessee sheriff buford pusser but this installment plays like a lame tv movie bo svenson takes over the lead role from joe don baker but he's much too mild for the part he comes off like an ambling country singer with a bat instead of a guitar good supporting actors like richard jaekel luke askew and robert doqui end up with very little to do i would give the film one star strictly on its good intentions but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predicaments and the production is cheapjack followed in 1977 by final chapter walking tall and in 1978 by the television film a real american hero
<START> i wonder who how and more importantly why the decision to call richard attenborough to direct the most singular sensation to hit broadway in many many years he's an academy award winning director yes he won for ghandi you moron jeremy irons is an academy winning actor do you want to see him play rocky balboa he has experience with musicals really oh what a lovely war have you forgotten to answer your question yes the film is a disappointment clear and simple not an ounce of the live energy survived the heavy handedness of the proceedings every character danced beautifully they were charming but their projection was theatrical i felt nothing but when i saw it on stage i felt everything the film should have been cast with stars unknown newcomers but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group great actors who could dance beautifully well michael douglas was in it true i forgot i'm absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right nothing like a richard attenborough michael douglas musical
<START> but watch mary mcdonnell's performance closely her body language her fine body movements her subtle but powerfully effective reactions this is an accomplished artist at the top of her craft and the rest of the cast were pretty damned good too o br br this is perhaps the 3rd or 4th viewing for me and i see more in it each time what is this world coming to anyway r
<START> the first few minutes of the bodyguard do have a campy charm it opens with crawling text from the bible the part that samuel jackson recites to his soon to be victims in pulp fiction continues with two karate school teachers in new york arguing about the eternal question of mankind who is better sonny chiba or bruce lee and then chiba appears playing himself he immediately stops a plane hijacking and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand unfortunately any entertainment value intentional or unintentional soon gets crushed by the disjointed story the lack of action for long periods of time and the poor quality of any present action to keep it simple here's why the bodyguard is an unbearable movie to watch br br 1 you don't know what's going on br br 2 there are barely any fights br br 3 the fights that are there are short and terribly filmed br br sonny chiba is cool judy lee is gorgeous her face is glorious it's only for them that i give the bodyguard a 2nd star out of 10 this movie makes 87 minutes feel like 5 hours
<START> i was 5 years old when i saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in st thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with it 27 years later it is still an original inspiration for achieveing my goals that i have set to accomplish since that time br br this tragic story of a hard core behind the scenes of the entertainment industry during the late 50's sparkle successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun this story could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand br br the phenomenal music written and composed by aretha franklin and curtis mayfield the soundtrack carries the plot with every song from being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for strong long term decision making to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead all three young girls sparkle sister and delores represent the different routes that one could take when you set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society br br this movie could have possibly spawned the ideas of creating dreamgirls on broadway and mariah carey's glitter 25 years later as an original audience member of both productions i have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to sparkle as well as in saturday night fever fame flashdance and the off broadway smash hit mama i want to sing
<START> i'll take you there tells of a woebegone man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date unlike most romantic comedies this little indie is mostly tongue in cheek situational comedy featuring rogers and sheedy with little emphasis on romance a sort of road trip flick with many fun and some poignant moments keeps moving stays fresh and is a worthwhile watch for indie lovers
<START> three stooges have rocket will travel 1959 this was the first feature length film to star the stooges and it is pretty bad it makes the three stooges go around the world in a daze from 1963 look like a masterpiece br br the stooges are janitors at a rocket place they climb into a rocket and it goes to venus they meet some stuff there including a talking unicorn they call uni which they bring back to earth with them uni speaks like an average pleasant person 'oh hello how are you lovely planet here hope you like it ' hilarious br br very few gags and so many of the scenes just go on and on and on br br the stooges arrive back from space and the film is over as far as the story goes but no one told that to the film makers for the picture continues for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens the stooges leave the party and then the film is almost over br br high point of the film the end where the stooges sing a dapper little song about their journey the larry and curly joe hit moe in the face with two pies brutal br br another writer mentioned the fine musical score huh the only music i even noticed were two classic tunes i'll take romance and there goes that song again both of which are played at the party and that really is the high point of the picture music from old columbia films br br the tall sexy blonde was nice br br awful a brand new vhs video from the 99 cents only store
<START> this film captures the true struggle with identity that is ongoing in our teenage years it is really moving and it feels strangely like a documentary not contrived but very real it is very interesting and unsettling
<START> normally i dont have a problem with gratuitous swearing in films but this one really annoyed me all they did was swear for the whole film and as someone else noted get cancer it was boring rambling and pretentious i wouldnt if i were you br br its also not that i dont like films which as most people who like it will claim 'observe life' i love eat drink man woman and all that happens in that is that a load of taiwanese people lead their lives but i could relate to them i have never met anyone who swore as much as the 'actors' in this film and i used to work on a construction site so go figure having said that william h macy made me grin once br br 2 10 avoid unless you enjoy tedium
<START> a simple comment br br what can i say this is a wonderful film that i can watch over and over it is definitely one of the top ten comedies made with a great cast jack lemmon and walter matthau wording a perfect script by neil simon based on his play br br it is real to life situation done perfectly if you have digital cable one gets the menu on bottom of screen to give what is on it usually gives this film stars but in reality it deserves stars if you really watch this film one can tell that it will be as funny and fresh a hundred years from now
<START> it looks like the brilliant team of shonda rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore maybe to the mediocreland pp reminds me any one of the many tedious promising at first but predictable within 1 season david kelly flicks picket fences ally mcbeal and now boston legal the crazy cases they get are so outlandish they barely evoke sympathy or sadness and that's what actually makes good medical dramas tick dramatic situations you are afraid of this could be me sentiment they are not funny either br br the actors are quite good but the plot lines are dead and cannot be brought back to live i'm a therapist and let me tell you amy brennan plays the most unbelievably incompetent unethical untrained therapist whoever writes her stuff flunked the ethics and the transference counter transference courses in stanford somebody should give them a code of ethics to read the episode with the nose bleeding wife and the therapist's involvement in it no therapists are that bad br br women yearning for men who have moved on had been done to death we've all graduated sex and the city addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes very age inappropriate looks so unnatural on a woman over 40 and this otherwise talented actress doesn't believe it herself and doesn't deliver it very well the only successful palatable developments are addison struggling with her decision to move to la and the voodoo dr and his coping with widowhood br br this concept might work with a whole new writing team
<START> ok so the oscars seem to get hyped just a little more each year and i was rooting for gosford park to win come on robert altman had deserved an oscar for years that said i guess that it was high time for an african american to win best actress contrary to the previous reviewer halle berry's role in monster's ball was far more original than nicole kidman's in moulin rouge i never would have thought to nominate the latter for anything especially in a year that saw mulholland dr br br among the things that i had predicted was the stuff about the september 11 attacks i knew that they were going to say something about freedom yeah yeah robert redford should know better but contrary again to the previous reviewer whoopi goldberg is not the worst host among the past hosts was bob hope for whom i have no respect i really liked her jab at john ashcroft br br so although i wouldn't have given a beautiful mind best picture the 74th annual academy awards still pleased me i have to admit i enjoy the oscars more than my own birthday and the day after as my parents and i were hiking around the dwellings in bandalier new mexico it was spring break i was thinking to myself that when jim broadbent won his oscar that most people watching were asking jim who i wonder whether or not woody allen will ever attend the oscars again
<START> what we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money revenge can corrupt your soul or something like that guy ritchie a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre bites off more than he can chew with this one br br his use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by swallowing his pride being nice to his enemy giving away all his money falls flat on it's face when jason statham's character no longer fears ray liotta it apparently drives liotta crazy enough to blow his head off in the final scene why basically you cannot set up a mafiosi like the liotta character who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a pitying smile on the face of statham's character br br before anyone starts to say i'm missing the point i'm not i get it ok opt out of the quest for riches you'll find true happiness and inner peace be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into self destruction this seems to be the gist of the movie and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story although hardly original the problem is that ritchie simply doesn't have the skill as a movie maker to carry it off at the moment when even guy ritchie realises this he appears to get bored with the story and begins to insert red herrings the scene when statham gets knocked over by a car why the shooting of some scenes as marvel comic animations again why br br there are so many loose threads unanswered questions left at the end of the movie you could get all 2001 ish about it and try figuring them out or simply accept that there are no answers each viewer will interpret things in their own way myself i was so bored with the pompous tone of the film that i simply didn't care frankly the ending couldn't come too soon so that i didn't have to sit through any more of this pretentious psychobabble br br a waste of two hours of my life
<START> rated r for strong language violent content and some nudity quebec rating 13 canadian home video rating 14a br br fear of a black hat is one of the funniest most original comedies i have ever seen its basically a gangsta rap version of the film this is spinal tap its a shame not many people have heard of this gem of a film if you manage to find this film anywhere don't hesitate to buy it even if you don't like rap music there are not too many comedy films that i give a perfect 10 10 to the only ones i can think of at the moment are this film clerks the world according to garp the 40 year old virgin and chasing amy this film is a hilarious stereotype of the gangsta rap culture the movie is about a woman named nina blackburn who is making a documentary about the fictional rap group n w h n z with hats they are basically the stereotype of a rap group making many controversial rap songs about killing and being a gangsta fear of a black hat is an excellent comedic film and i recommend it even if you are not a fan of the gangsta rap scene its a shame this film is not in the top 250 br br runtime 88min br br 10 10
<START> this movie was beautiful it was full of memorable imagery good acting and touching subject matter it would be very easy to write it off as being too sentimental but that is the sentiments this type of a movie is trying to achieve i was totally involved in the story's unfolding and presentation there were a few cheesy shots but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film the only complaint i can conjure is there wasn't a ton of details however this movie wasn't created to explain every element of joseph smith's life ministry triumphs controversies failures etc it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights of one of the most amazing american and historical religious figures of all time
