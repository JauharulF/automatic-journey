<START> i had some expectation for the movie since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif well i was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for dhoom franchise because i hated dhoom 2 but if dhoom 2 is compared to tashan i would say dhoom 2 is very realistic br br when i saw the credits at the beginning i felt nice because it was put up in a nice way well the very first scene itself pis ed me off then the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights it was like akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns phew you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are br br the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story it reminded me of some of the early 80's movies br br well the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena who looked really hot in this one and for that i give a rating of 2 out of 10 br br guys please please don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie well you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes br br thats all
<START> finally i thought someone is going to do justice to h g wells's classic not another version set in the wrong locale or era but one based firmly on the book well it definitely follows the book pretty closely and that is the only plus to this mess br br this is 180 min's yes 3 hours long the book is only around 150 pages br br if timothy hines had the nerve to come on here and say if you can do any better i would say yes i could and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my life br br i paid good money to get this crap over to the uk from the usa do not make the same mistake as me
<START> i've seen some crappy movies in my life but this one must be among the very worst definately bottom 100 material imo that is br br we follow two couples the dodds billy bob thornton as lonnie earl and natasha richardson as darlene and the kirkendalls patrick swayze as roy and charlize theron as candy in one car on a roadtrip to reno br br apparently lonnie isn't too happy with his sex life so he cheats on his wife with candy who's despirately trying to have a baby roy meanwhile isn't too sure if his sperm is ok so he's getting it checked by a doctor br br now i had read the back of the dvd but my girlfriend didn't and she blurted out after about 20 minutes 'oh yeah she's gonna end up pregnant but her husband can't have any baby's' spot on as this movie is soooo predictable as well as boring and annoying meaningless offensive terrible br br an example of how much this movie stinks the two couples set out in their big car towards nevada when they are stopped by 2 police officers as they didn't stop at a stop sign the guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer not only is this scene pointless and not important or even relevant for the movie it takes about 5 minutes it's just talk and talk and talk without ever going somewhere br br i still have to puke thinking about the ending though apparently roy isn't having problems down there so he is the father of the child how many times does that happen in the movies try something new the cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after yuck br br best scene of the movie is right at the end with a couple of shots of the grand canyon why couldn't they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutes br br one would expect more from this cast although thornton really tries but you can't really blame them writers shame on you br br 1 10
<START> ayone who whines about how this movie was crap or that it had no plot must have been looking for jean de florrette hello this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form i would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point this film is clearly made for people who don't appreciate the so called american humour which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap the point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciative that some peoples sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth off br br thankyou
<START> classic drama action western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of it's time 1954 the production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and love unique peek into the american northt west pioneers is very educational and entertaining this movie is very under rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many lawmen during this particular time and place were very crooked corrupt much like most developing countries today the action sequences could have been more realistic though but still this movie really covers most of the essentials not for an audience who wants only pure testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy
<START> in a way corridors of time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal being seen by thousands but it fails at making them laugh br br les visiteurs has had its success because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel forget about zemeckis's back to the future here comes the old france the middle age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life full of pride funny thanks to the ancient words he uses montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor then comes the sequel br br nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of les visiteurs the first and it's no use being a movie expert to realize that the corridors of time has been made for money br br the general story begins after the end of les visiteurs and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought explanation it's no use trying to get back the jewelry jacquouille has stolen don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode where do you think he found the money selling the jewelry and that's only one of many holes poirÃ© tries to avoid and fails br br let's have a look at the characters montmirail doesn't change he's just a little more boring regarding frenegonde that's another story valÃ©rie lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role and muriel robin tries to imitate her in a way that i found so pitiful i nearly felt pain for her and poirÃ© doesn't realize that a cast of humorists isn't enough to make a good comedy br br forget about the time travels about the digital effects concentrate on the story and you'll see that there's enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times br br the main interest of this film is the landscapes a movie for youngsters let's say up to 13 years old
<START> when you put this dvd into your player and hit play you will experience a brief moment of silence and see a black screen as the laser is guided to the correct starting point in the center of the disc cherish this moment make sure you have some tylenol or something preferably pm's so you can fall asleep because you're going to have a massive headache once this movie starts br br starring a bunch of big breasted girls and with an opening that actually made me chuckle a bit i thought i'd be in for a good time sure the opening sequence was a wee bit awkward and most of the jokes fell flat and it seemed like this was going to be a scream ripoff by the way my sole chuckle was from julie strain's final comment in this scene but then i knew there was trouble the opening sequence had a terrible rock song during this terrible rock song i looked over the dvd chapter titles and saw things that said topless in the backyard and better than sex i knew what the selling point of this movie was going to be br br and that's the sad truth the only good thing about this movie is the attractive cast other than that it's a sadly routine slasher film that throws in an innovative concept about murder clubs which ends up being fake anyway so the whole movie then points in another direction to try to be confusing and this huge mystery but it all just adds up to not being interesting at all and leaves you feeling like you don't care for any of the characters i mean when the main character of the movie is revealed to have murdered an innocent woman can you really feel any sympathy towards her when she's in fear for her life the scream influence is prevalent throughout with a ghost face killer and some really terrible jokes we're also treated to scenes of the main character talking to her mom and dad lloyd kaufman the only other cool part of the movie about an abortion or something uh yeah this isn't a so bad it's good movie it's just bad br br someone compared this to a troma film but you know most any film that comes from full moon or its offshoot as this film proves is horrible not horrible in a troma sense i've seen many troma films and i can honestly say they all offer something anything that you can walk away with and tell your friends about later however this film has pretty much nothing at all enjoyable about it beware
<START> i just came from seeing this movie and decided to see what others thought of it i'm left wondering if these people who give glowing reviews saw the same film this is potentially a very good story but it fails to hit the mark the script is very weak the plot has so many holes that it would make a great dip net for the fishing scenes the characters were not well developed and the storyline jumps around so much that i found myself asking the question how did we get here at least a half dozen times during the movie br br there was a lack of any chemistry between the cast members this is probably related to lindsay lohan's antics during the filming it was pretty clear that everyone showed up and did their job but didn't commit to their roles br br this is not a movie worth seeing go for a walk play a board game take a nice warm bath and save your money for something that's worth it
<START> an old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat he wanders the woods to witness a murder but did he see the murder or is he losing his mind is he just getting old the movie so great because the viewer has to make up their own mind on what is going on there is very little dialog in this movie but it doesn't need words the whole movie speaks for itself you knew what was going on and i liked it br br the other part that i liked were the shots of the woods in late fall and winter those were pretty but the only thing i didn't like was the view of the old man in his underwear he could have tied the robe a little tighter but other than that it was a pretty deep movie
<START> koen wouters is a flemish singer and presenter in the early ninety's he tried his hand on movies as well but this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all it also ended the acting career of dutch actress nada van nie who went on being a football wife a tv presenter and program maker i actually did see this in an almost empty theatre because i used to be a fan of the band of koen wouters clouseau i so regret spending money on it it looks cheap it is a terrible story and it is executed bad in every possible way some people think it's so bad it's funny i am not one of them i just found it an incredible waste of time and money
<START> this film is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film unnecessary slow motion unnecessary flipping jumping somersaults unnecessary characters unnecessary dialogue basically unnecessity is that a word well it's just been invented by i robot br br what happened to practicality i e the car garage the skin spray the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop br br what happened to showing respect for women i e smith's character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film and yet she still wants him where is the tension i'll tell you where good looks and not admiration or common ground br br what happened to a detective that detects smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself complaining to other people and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off this is such a lame way to get the story from point b c d etc it was ok once but not several times in a row speaking of several times in a row what was the i'm snoring and not listening to you joke twice in one scene br br what happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes shia labeouf the kid is in the movie for a total of two scenes we know that a he degrades women and b he knows smith so of course we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm br br what happened to hero's let's just forget that there are people women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that i have an acquaintance with and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air showing off while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot br br don't get me wrong i'm all for spectacle but i'm also all for a shred of realism and meaning br br i have to say i've never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time so thanks alex br br i pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques simpler stories and simpler everything else in films but mainly simpler techniques br br big budget action films you so have to die
<START> not since caligula have i considered turning off the movie half way through but then with this one i was only 15 minutes in when i considered unfortunately i did make it all the way through make sure that you do not br br it's not that cradle of fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual it's that it's not any of those things yet it so desperately wants to be all of them instead it's boring trite ordinary predictable and unexceptionally poorly executed shot on video high school special effects no sense of even basic visual storytelling dialog barely audible not that it's worth hearing though br br this movie is proof for the argument that even the straight to video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere
<START> without a doubt one of the worst movies i've seen in recent years the story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with it's tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions oh no the cops are on to us they know who we are what do we do let's rob one more bank then we're outta here what every character is a stereotype and it's easy to tell who's gonna end up dead
<START> the charm of otto preminger's grandiose visionary film noir is that it has ambiguous intentions betraying the gloomy essence of the central character who is still vexed by living in the shadow of his criminal father dana andrews' driven vindictive cop is shown as an outsider irrational and destructive who maybe can change because he might've found a good woman to look after him the troubled man reclaims himself with his own tangled impression of rectitude the distressing mood permanently circuited into the latter half of the story by screenwriter ben hecht reverberates in andrews' tense performance as preminger saturates the film in a relevantly prosaic substance of style we don't just see and hear the city at night we feel it because preminger lets us see and hear even the most peripheral and distant factors of it br br dana andrews furnishes a complex character unfolded through his streaks of violence and the hatred that always infests him as the plot develops he is secretly entangled in situational snares yet he is renewed by the outward acts that can be seen in the vintage noir protagonist's visceral facial expressions before he executes them br br this reflection of a specific phase in the development of the genre is an engrossing feral and shady film noir that is set in the double dealing climate of the underworld where the hero is so estranged that he is always swelling with rage and even though he loses his rational resistance occupational principle and ethical limits he's still a good cop preminger just winks at telling a social conscience drama about a corrupted community within the sprawling cityscape rather keeping the thriller riding on andrews' shoulders as an existential journey of personal ramifications about a man with an oedipal fixation who is becoming disconnected though with the ever shrinking influences of the law on his side and an undying perception of right and wrong br br the production companies in the early 1950s pussed out on the social problem picture and rather made low budget low risk thrillers such as this apparently in an attempt to evade the conniptions of conservative critics and social busybodies but there is an expressionistic matter of factness to preminger's inimitable approach he injects each scene with a sense of everyday drama as a backdrop for the plot each supporting character must pull their own weight by doing something interesting but none of them are cartoons or depressing comic reliefs to him every character thinks they're the star as per the straight from the shoulder self assertion of karl malden as a missionary police inspector and a veteran waitress at a lunch counter it is those who are the stars andrews and gene tierney both anguished by their futile attempts to subdue their emotional intensity who don't want to be
<START> this is just short of a full blown gore fest based on a stephen king story two tabloid reporters one seasoned miguel ferrer and one not so accomplished julie entwisle begin to believe that a serial killer michael h moss may actually be a vampire stranger than odd is this modern day blood sucker does not wing his way naturally but by way of a black cessna he seeks his victims the gore actually gets gruesome as the film nears its stupid finale keep in mind that mr king had nothing to do with this film i do admit it is a bit scary in the wee hours of the night
<START> i saw this movie on comedy central a few times this movie was pretty good it's an interesting adventure with the life of sunny davis who is arranged to marry the king of ohtar so that the u s can get an army base there to balance power in the middle east some good jokes including sunnygate i also just loved the ending theme it gave me great political spirit ten out of ten was my rating for this movie
<START> this is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of irish locations if the great m r james had ever come up with a tale this thin doesn't james in fact have a story called a thin ghost he wouldn't have bothered to have it published br br orson welles appears in the limp endpieces as a favour to a brace of old friends this film's producers his presence and the one movie industry in joke would have earned this will o' the wisp its oscar nomination this is yet more proof if any more were needed that the academy awards have never been any guarantee of merit
<START> where would one start a review of the film snitch'd james cahill god rest his soul made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since encino man his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop mcclure which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking and discovers a gang war to rival that of police academy 1 and i mean the one where jones is racially vilified by his new partner but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will ever hear br br cahill's grasp of effects both visual and aural is electrifying the slight pause between action on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that is snitch'd a real gritty like underground thriller also kudos to his brilliant use of makeup such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue yuck i feel the world of film is much less from james' passing his memory will linger on and on and on reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production snitch'd his insightful director's commentary released a coke hit up the nose of any discerning film goer truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets captured in all the beauty of a roughneck punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a brawl br br but i ask you why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap i'll tell you why because thats life in santa ana baby its not all drive bys and hastily constructed principle's offices oh no there are some folk who must infiltrate the soft tattooed underbelly of street life in la to kick their way through in moves that would not seem out of place at a school for special children's production of double dragon the play br br the only qualm i have with this film is that there was never a sequel made come on steven spielberg come on george lucas come on guy that made revenge of the nerds 1 through 23 how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man james cahill br br he discovered eva longoria you know oh yeah that he did br br jonah
<START> i watched the unrated version of this film and realised about 30 minutes into it that i was never getting my time back i persevered to the end hoping that the dialogue would improve the martial arts would look realistic eventually the special fx would actually look special i was so wrong i love horror i am a complete gore hound i number some of the eighties splatter flicks amongst the greats of the film world this however was not made in the eighties if this film had come out in the early eighties the fax could be forgiven for looking so bad it wasn't so it hasn't got that defence the dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines i was wincing at the writing rather than squirming at torture i don't like hostel never have i thought it was over rated over hyped and i felt nothing for the protagonists however it shines as a beacon to greatness next to this garbage the back of the cover for live feed promised a twist you would never see coming i'm still waiting for the twist that was promised
<START> i wanted to like magnolia the plot reminded me of grand canyon which i liked 4 different lives stories that come together at the end but magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and i was lost i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end little did i know it would be another torturous 1 1 2 hours thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre i almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene my dvd player still hasn't forgiven me and i don't blame it one bit it was a unique movie but a bad boring and pointless movie
