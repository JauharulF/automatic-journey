<START> when the remake of when a stranger calls was out obviously i was interested in watching the original then when i read about the original which i recall had my sisters totally freaked out back in the day i saw that the real money is on black christmas which apparently beat everyone to the the caller is in the house punch so i netflix that and it sits at the top of my list for months due to its very long wait all this time i am getting more and more eager to see it then one day out of the blue it finally arrives and it's a total snore br br sure maybe i had elevated expectations but i don't think it would have gained more had i seen it fresh the thing is it's christmas in some canadian college town and there's this sorority having a party we see some killer pov shots as he climbs this trellis and sneaks into the attic so we know he's in the house then we're introduced to our charactersÂ olivia hussey as the mousy whiny canadian accented jess margot kidder as the annoying overtly aggressive alcoholic barb she's so annoying even her mother dis invites her for her christmas festivities there's also this irritating janis ian clone phil and this alcoholic den mother mrs mac seen taking nips from the various bottles of booze she has stashed all over the house we also meet jess's highly strung boyfriend peter played by keir dullea of 2001 and bunny lake is missing fame though halfway through the film i was still asking myself which one's keir dullea br br so it seems that the house has been receiving obscene phone calls but this was before email so they couldn't ask him to send a photo thenÂ well you know how they say those plastic dry cleaning bags are not a toy one of the sisters finds that out the hard way don't worry if you don't catch the first 14 shots of the plastic encased corpse face as it reposes in the atticÂ there'll be 28 more interspersed throughout the film obviously there to make you say oh my god there's a corpse in the attic though after the first hour that changes to how come the dumb police haven't found the rather prominently placed plastic encased corpse in the attic especially as it is made abundantly clear that it is clearly visible from outside the house really any time before csi came on the air must have been such a golden age of crime the cops are so dumb fortunately some of them look like john saxon br br anyway after a lot more darn boring human drama the house mother fears that her precious kitty has ascended a vertical ladder and has pushed open a heavy looking trap door that rests atop it those wily cats for she sticks her head in there and ends up with a hook pulley in her neck for the trouble now we have two corpses up in the atticÂ hey why don't we have 75 more shots trying to chill us by the fact that there are now two corpses in the attic br br so by now the police have begun to take the situation seriously and tap the houses' phone and station a cop outside they inform jess and her pal janis ian that if the obscene caller calls back they need to keep him on the phone jessica who has grown even more whiny mousy and annoying keeps asking the caller who is this what do you want who are you after like the first 89 calls when it is clear that he is not going to answer her isn't that like a sign a developmental disability the inability to learn from unsuccessful attempts at something and what's he going to do suddenly say oh yeah hi it's bob from the laundromat dumb jess br br spoilers anyway soon janis ian and lois lane kidder are piled in bed with ketchup splashed on their faces this film's idea of gore and idiot jess realizes that not a single door or window in the house is locked hello are you being stalked or what then the cops realize that the killer is in the house and call jess and tell her don't ask questions just do as i sayÂ walk to the front door and get out so what does moron jess do starts screaming phil barb phil barb hey great idea sister now why don't you go right upstairs where you know a psychotic killer is lurking of course she does and sees her former friends all splashed with ketchup prompting this viewer to scream at the screen have a clue now br br now obviously one needs to be understanding and realize that this movie was made before the classic slasher movie tropes were solidly in place and that it doesn't move to the same pace we're used to and seeing a plastic covered corpse in the attic like 206 times probably was scary back in the day and people weren't used to being stalked by psychopaths so they wouldn't think to you know lock the doors or windows and they might be tempted to wander upstairs when they have just been told that a rabid killer is up there you see people were stupid back in the 70s we have to understand that one of the big shocks is that we don't even see our proto final girl kill the psycho but believe me that fact is more interesting being read in this review than sitting through the movie for spoilers

<START> i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such an impressive movie without any music but it is just the pictures watch out for that picture anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul really strong might make you feel different
<START> if this is the first of the nemesis films that you have seen then i strongly urge you to proceed no further the sequels to nebula prove to be no better hard to believe considering this entry is bottom of the barrel this movie tries but it's just not worth your time folks take a nap instead
<START> this was a fabulous adaptation of jane eyre the only problem i had with it was that i didn't like zelah clarke i thought she was too old and made jane seem much to timid in the book jane seemed like a much stronger character i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her the part where it's the morning after rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh i think they made a bad choice in casting her but dalton was absolutely wonderful as rochester he makes this version of jane eyre worth seeing another thing that made this version not quite 100 was the quality of film i know it was made in the eighties for tv if it had been a feature film and better quality it would have been perfect my main complaint however is that zelah clarke was definitely too old
<START> wow not only is this film a new lesson in real bad taste but also a lesson in real bad film making don't get me wrong i appreciated the concept of 'zombie '90 extreme pestilence ' but at the same time one must realize when a movie is terrible in case you missed out on the storyline the plot of 'zombie '90' is about a government plane carrying toxic chemicals that so happens to crash into the wilderness causing the chemicals to spill turning locals into hideous looking zombies the next thing you know zombies are all over the city eating people alive while a goofy looking doctor and a government agent are trying to figure out the disease that's making these people eat one another hence the name extreme pestilence from then on all we see is zombies having a field day on every local in sight nothing but extreme and sickening disembowelments and dismemberments accompanied by endless buckets of guts and gore since this is a german film the film had to be dubbed into english and when you're not laughing at the feeding frenzies of the zombies the voice overs are quite hilarious and entertaining as well as user unratedx mentioned spoiler spoiler spoiler there is a scene in the film that crosses the line between what's acceptable and not acceptable hence the scene in which a woman who is carrying her infant baby is being wheeled around in her wheelchair by some dude and a horde of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them one zombie grabs the baby and rips it into pieces eating its organs as you hear the baby crying wow that is a new lesson in reallllllllly bad taste atrocious i tell you atrocious
<START> to some this biblical film is a story of judgment and condemnation others see it as a story of grace restoration and hope it is actually both Â henry king illustrates the portrait of a mighty monarch almost destroyed by his passion his downward spiral of sin and his upward climb of healing br br 'david and bathsheba' is an emotional movie full of vividly memorable characters who attain mythic status while retaining their humanity henry king handles the powerful story taken from the old testament with skill br br david 'the lion of judah ' having stormed the walls of rabgah saves the life of one of his faithful warriors uriah kieron moore and returns to jerusalem br br back at his court his first wife complains of neglect and offends him for being a shepherd's son distinguishing herself for being the daughter of king saul br br one evening and while walking on the terrace of his palace which evidently held a commanding view of the neighborhood david's eyes happened to alight upon a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath she was beautiful and attractive david could not take his eyes off her he finds out later on that she was the wife of one of his officers br br sending for her he discovers that she too is unhappy in her marriage by this point it's apparent that david's intentions shift from an interest in taking bathsheba as a wife to just plain taking bathsheba as usual sin had its consequences and david hadn't planned on that possibility br br when a drought sweeps the land and there is a threat of famine david suspects that the lord is punishing him and his people for his sin but when bathsheba tells him that she is pregnant and fears that she may be stoned to death according to the law of moses david tries to cover up his sin br br he sends word to joab the commander of his army and ordered him to send to him bathsheba's husband david did something that was abominable in god's sight he sends the man to the front line where he would be killed br br the soldier is indeed killed and with him out of the way david marries his beloved bathsheba in full regal splendor br br god punishes the couple when bathsheba's child dies soon after birth meanwhile a mighty famine has spread throughout the land and the israelites led by nathan blame the king for their plight they storm the palace and demand that bathsheba pays for her sin br br peck plays the compassionate king whose lustful desire outweighed his good sense and integrity br br hayward as bathsheba is a sensitive woman who begins to believe that every disaster occurring in her life is the direct result of her adultery the sequence of her bath which could have been a great moment in biblical film history is badly mishandled and the viewers eyes are led briefly to hayward's face and shoulders br br raymond massey appeared as nathan the prophet sent by god to rebuke david after his adultery with bathsheba gwyneth verdon is queen michal who tries to resist the ambition and greed that have become integral to david's personality and kingship ex silent screen idol francis x bushman had a brief part as king saul br br the best moments of the film were the ark en route to its permanent home when god breaks a young soldier who tries to touch the sacred object the defining moment in david's life when he confesses his sin and is prepared to accept his punishment of death and for the film's climax inserting it as a flashback david remembering his fight with the giant goliath br br with superb color photography and a masterly music score 'david and bathsheba' won oscar nominations in the following categories music scoring art and set direction cinematography story and screenplay and costume design
<START> a talking parrot isn't a hugely imaginative idea for a new film but paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant heartwarming film that will delight the whole family it manages to bridge the gap between sentimental trash and cruel harshness during marie and paulie's separation and all the events in the film lead to a hugely satisfying emotional conclusion the animal training is well done everyone will be affected when paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time paulie is a great character and should have received way more success though this film wasn't a highlight of 1998 unlike saving private ryan this hour and a half will surely be an enjoyable one and one that you will remember paulie's story is a moving sad happy and interesting one from the moment he is first seen to the moment he is united with his original owner you will enjoy following him and watching him learning about friendship and the grim realities of life along the way not one to be missed if you have any kind of heart or emotion 9 10
<START> this was the worst christmas movie i ever saw i took my two small children to see this it was the darkest most dismal plot family has no money mom loses her job father gets killed in the bank bank robber steals family car with both kids in the back and after high speed chase drives off the bridge and drowns them in the river mom is left all alone no wonder her christmas spririt is gone christmas angels do not rescue children that have drowned and santa does not bring back dead fathers i thought this was the worst message to send children better to tell them that there is no santa than show them a movie like this
<START> wow how can i even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes it was surely the highlight of my year nay my life as if the raptor graphics weren't amazing enough the award winning editors continued to use the exact same shot throughout the entire movie even when the background didn't actually match up with the setting of the scene wow what genius and while the movie is full of plot holes for instance a few clips of a t rex type animal where a raptor should be and one key moment where pappy finds a torture chamber screams colin's a girl and runs out i will never forget the brilliance that is raptor planet thank you sci fi for another classic
<START> this movie is banned in just about every foreign country i can think of the japanese people who star in this must have been really desperate for a job or we're just friends here's the scoop br br three thugs torture the hell out of a helpless woman they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her they burn her kick her spin here around in a chair over 200 times they use sound torture by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over 20 hours it don't sound that bad at all but it can make you go nuts they throw guts probably from an animal at her while shes knocked out and she freaks when she wakes up and who can forget the grande finale the greatest eyeball torture i have ever seen br br if you have not heard of these films and watch one without knowing that it is a simulated snuff film you will think it is just ask charlie sheen this is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick like i said pure underground check it out if you are a fan of underground horror or foreign gore if your not i highly recommend you read up on the series before watching from the gore shock and creativity aspect it gets a 10 but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a 1 an underground classic br br my final rating is a 8 10 br br
<START> really the use of stock nature documentary of swarming bats employed by the bat people is some of the most effective ever there are shots of teeming bats hanging from the ceilings of caves swarming bats flying out of caves or swirling about near the mouths of caves that alone is enough to be unsettling imagine all of them swarming after you and they do indeed swarm in what should have been a show stopper sequence that happened at about the forty minute mark a downright inappropriately hilarious sequence where a teeming swarm of bats seem to attack a police car splattering across the windshield like bloody broken eggs the problem is that this sequence happens about fifty minutes too late to save the film most of which consists of one or more people running around screaming waving their arms about at jabbering excitedly about some poor goofball who managed to get bitten by a bat during his vacation br br the fear is that he is coming down with rabies which does indeed suck so their vacation is ruined as the plot synopsis on the top of the bat people's reference page does indeed point out so here is an effective summary of the movie a young couple goes on a romantic getaway which is ruined when the guy is bitten by a bat they bravely try to stick it out but he starts raving trying to convince those around him that it's a bit more involved than rabies that he can't control himself and they everyone should keep away br br now when some one is frothing at the mouth covered with sweat eyes boggling about like one of the cheaper muppets and screaming at you to get away from me you get away from him you don't try to give him drugs you don't try to tell him you love him you give the guy his space go home and try that scenic getaway next year br br but no the people in this movie all behave like morons insist on pushing the guy to his brink and he flips out mutates into a part man part bat type creature and kills a bunch of non essential secondary characters nothing wrong with that but the movie forgets that it's a low budget creature feature and tries to be some sort of psychological study instead of a monster movie we get lots of people running around trying to get this guy to take a chill pill and eventually he runs off into the hills looking very much more human than he should have people insist on trying to chase him down and pay the expected price br br the main thing wrong with the movie is that this should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes thirty tops and the movie should have been about the guy after he had turned into a bat person rather than about the journey there it takes a good eighty minutes to really pick up steam on that front with some interesting character sketches along the way involving the always entertaining michael pataki as a small town cop who's lost his moral edge and the late paul carr as a physician friend who doesn't quite get the message br br the movie is dreadfully boring about fifteen minutes too long and missed the opportunity to be a nice forgettable little creature feature about a mutant run amok like the italian horror favorite ratman which i watched today and was sadly inspired to try this one after seeing me and my bright ideas though the scene with the cop car was a howler too bad we couldn't have had another twenty minutes of that br br 3 10
<START> i really can't understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than 1 star how can you like such a retarded film where all the animal abuse scenes are real i don't even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments jesus what kind of ''human'' would torture them like that for no reason or just for money i tell you that director is either mentally retarded or he's just a monster with a ''heart'' of stone or both he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alive br br it contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock especially to sensitive persons and children a real frog is skinned alive fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water a dog is beaten birds are thrown into the water br br this movie is more than awful it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made along with another one called ''cannibal holocaust'' or something like that i'll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster no one should waste their time watching it especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there in which all the animal abuse scenes are staged br br fortunately only a few people liked this which is natural since it's the worst film ever so it wasn't successful i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films i truly believe that everyone receives but what they give there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel ''humans'' will feel the same pain they once inflicted to others br br this however is probably my only ''negative'' review i usually don't comment on a movie if i dislike it but this time i just couldn't shut up i had to speak the truth because animal abuse must stop
<START> this movie is awesome on so many levels and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on br br just remember this when you're watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movies be they good or bad this is the formula that they are using this is what makes zombie movies so great br br and what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie a simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know br br all in all it doesn't linger there's never a point where you think to yourself c'mon get on with it it moves quick and corners nicely this is the sporty little italian number of zombie flicks br br so awful it's wonderful if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek rent it buy it love it br br as a great trivia note if you're watching it on dvd you'll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen underneath the musical score well that's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop
<START> shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage but when this stage is israel the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style dan katzir manages to do a spectacular portrait of a part of life in tel aviv but besides katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the israeli people and this people far from being simple prominent figures they speak to us from the heart katzir's film allows israel escape from dark informative crux in which they live and this wonderful country arises to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his ashes it is very great for me because the reality of state of israel which the europeans only know for the informative diaries or the newspapers appears as a close and absolutly human reality the reality of million people who looking for his place exploring the whole state the whole culture with the only aim to feel part of it katzir constructs an absolutely wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force and these feelings cross our hearts thank you dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world
<START> this motion picture comes straight out of the dark dungeon of full moon entertainment this production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90's by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies the most famous disasters in their ouvre are subspecies seedpeople and trancers none of these are recommended and neither is doctor mordrid actually hyperactive director charles band did come to the right company for his film doctor mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless i only saw it because it stars jeffrey combs i learned that it can have several disadvantages if you're a fan of him for every good movie it seems like he has made 5 inferior ones anyways the story is about the battle between 2 ancient sorcerers one good one who's here since 150 years to protect the humans jeffrey as dr mordrid and one wicked one called kabal he wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason i already forgot combs gets his instructions from mentor that guy only exists of a pair of eyes in space very very cheesy that is every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen but that's about the only form of special effects this movie has got the whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other it's over before you know it i would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little but nooooooo in some scenes you really can detect some originality and creativity like for example jeffrey's lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals and if you really pay attention you might even find some very small but nice aspects like the raven which is called edgar allen but overall it's a terrible waste of time and energy i'm a big fan of jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes but he sure doesn't have to put on a stupid maillot for that
<START> i didn't have many expectation going into the film but i thought it was fantastic pierce brosnan is outstanding in a very different role he has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor pierce and greg kinnear play off each other great and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time the humor is dark the performances by brosnan kinnear and hope davis are great mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship and you have a great film this is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time this is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post bond era of brosnan's career
<START> a stuttering plot uninteresting characters and sub par to say the least dialogue plagues this tv production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion dollar production budget br br the characters aren't believable in their motives actions or their professed occupations the plot reads like a bad dungeons and dragons tm hack but with plasma rifles and force fields there are severe continuity issues and the degree of pointless interaction between the characters has this author at least wincing br br avoid it like the plague watch any episode of dark angel and you will have better acting dialogue and plot yuck
<START> totally ridiculous if you know anything about poker you will find it absolutely appalling but also entertaining because it is so clueless the nerd who made this movie is obviously very religious and knows slightly about the game of poker but i doubt he's ever played above 3 6 i think he also knows nothing of golf where to start i've seen better productions in the intro to film class i took freshmen year of film school the actors to watch in this movie are queen momma scotty nguyen and the loser who can never win at poker everyone else is as wooden as they come like bad porn actors br br spoiler the man the movie starts with in the opening sequence is the only reason the film got made he is a railbird who doesn't play poker and never has a line of dialogue but the actor is the man who obviously paid for the movie i can't think of a more useless waste of money than this man shelling out for this pointless production it's fitting that he had such a useless role br br there's very little poker in this movie most of the time is spent on useless side characters whose plots aren't resolved in the slightest queen momma does have a show stealing scene where she throws her loser boyfriend through a window and tries to shoot his brains out also the nameless arabs in the convenience store also give brilliant performances when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady who robs them their subtle performances are easily among the film's highlights it makes you wonder why they bothered getting all these white people to play the leads br br in conclusion complete nonsense plan 9 from outer space has slightly more coherency if you play poker though you might want to have a laugh also if you're christian you might enjoy some of the heavy handed religious conversation that pepper the movie like pointless pepper i hate movies made by religious people especially ones who think they know something about things they know nothing about it's sad that jennifer harman and scotty nguyen got involved in this travesty as i can't help but think less of them they must be envious of johnny chan for getting in rounders
<START> i thought this movie was really really great because in india cinemas nowadays all you see is skin music and bad acting in this movie you can see some tradition ethnicity and at least some decency although some parts were a little dramatic guess what that is what indian cinema is all about after watching this movie at least you don't get a headache from all the loud overrated music or any violence its just the truth it teaches about love and of course caring for the person you love throughout life i think it was an amazing movie kids can watch it without a doubt and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be india's sure profoundness until all these rap hits miniskirts and skin showing became a part of it
<START> this movie is funny and painful at the same time the cinemagic almost gave me a seizure despite what they imply cinemagic is not some innovative technical procedure it was developed as the result of an accident and they used it because it disguised the fact that their monsters were so stupid looking i also don't think it's a coincidence that the writer is sid pink br br this movie is good for a laugh if you are really looking for a movie made in 9 days on 200 000 dollars it is entertaining at least i can say that about it the bat rat spider is the highlight
