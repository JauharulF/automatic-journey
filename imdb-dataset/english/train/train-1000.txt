<START> a young woman suffers from the delusion that she is a werewolf based upon a family legend of an ancestor accused of and killed for allegedly being one due to her past treatment by men she travels the countryside seducing and killing the men she meets falling in love with a kind man her life appears to take a turn for the better when she is raped and her lover is killed by a band of thugs traumatized again by these latest events the woman returns to her violent ways and seeks revenge on the thugs according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br rino di silvestro's la lupa mannara begins with full frontal writhing moaning dance by shapely blonde annik borel who as daniella neseri mistakenly believes she is a werewolf the hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between her legs the opening flashback reveals her hairy ancestor was probably a lycanthropic creature ms borel is unfortunately not a werewolf she is merely a very strong lunatic br br as a film werewolf woman in english would have been better if borel's character really was a female werewolf with her sexual victimization a great bit of characterization but as far as 1970s skin and blood flicks go this one is hard to beat bouncy borel is either nude or sexily clad throughout the film which features a fair amount of gratuitous gore dazzling dagmar lassander as elena and hunky howard ross as luca are good supporting players
<START> when i was a kid in the 50's and 60's anything connected with disney was by definition great what happened they are able to get any actors and actresses they want the best of their time but somehow disney manages to screw things up in spite of their abundant resources br br disney can afford the best writers the best producers and directors but still they screw things up this movie is crap the sad thing is that i suspect disney in their arrogance does not even know when a movie is good or bad br br it is only due to the talent of the actors that i can even give it a 3 of 10
<START> this one is a little better than the first one it still relies on a lot of its humor which basically keeps saying that the old bond movies were not realistic that wears thin after so many parodies the girls were more interesting in this one br br there is a tremendous amount of total gross out humor hopefully one day real comedy will come back
<START> bill buddy rogers is sent to new york by his uncle richard tucker to experience life before he inherits 25million his uncle has paid 3 women jacqui kathryn crawford maxine josephine dunn and pauline carole lombard to chaperone him and ensure that he does not fall foul of gold diggers one such lady cleo geneva mitchell turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women we follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the 3 months that bill is in new york while bill meets with cleo and another woman at the end love is in the air for bill and one other br br the picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film the story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and kathryn crawford has a terrible voice rogers isn't that good either he's pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone there is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver roscoe karns and the film is just dull
<START> saw this movie at the rotterdam iff you may question some decisions of the maker like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject but this movie sure hits you in the gut especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch hope it gets the distribution it deserves
<START> well now this was certainly a surprise episode in this anthology science fiction series with all of this alien beings extraordinary occurrences and many brushes with the hereafter this episode would certainly rate as unusual its seemingly insignificant settings apparently not imparting any morale at story's end or does it kicking off with the silent movie form no recorded dialog but having musical accompaniment in this case it's on the sound track not utilizing the playing of organ or piano by an on sight musician this part of the episode along with the ending section also made liberal use o title cards just like the old time movies while these titles are a bit exaggerated and overdone they are made so intentionally and with an affection for rather than any contempt for the silent film br br veteran comedy film director norman z mcleod was the man in the chair for this half hour installment he had been the director of many of the greatest comedies of all time featuring people like the marx brothers w c fields harold lloyd and danny kaye he was no stranger to to tv as he had done a lot of work on television series br br it doesn't appear that he and mr keaton had ever worked together before as i cannot find any evidence of this ' but judging by the outcome of the film they succeeded in doing so with flying colors anyone who directed keaton was aware that buster was also a fine comedy director as well as a comedy player he was just as comfortable behind the camera as he was in front of it their short partnership must have been a harmonious one with 'give and take' about how to do things it is apparent that many of the gags were keaton's resurrected from his own silent picture days for example the gag of putting the pair of pants on with rollo's stanley adams assistance was done by keaton and roscoe fatty arbuckle in one of the arbuckle 2 reelers the garage 1919 that was a clear example of his craft in a nutshell br br buster knew that we film our world with a camera rendering it a two dimensional image this one fact is at the bottom of so many of gags it is a cardinal rule for his film making br br the cast was small and once again just chock full of veteran talent stanley adams was rollo and served as mr keaton's straight man jesse white the old 'maytag repair man' ran the fix it shop that fixed the 'time hjelmet' gil lamb serene veteran of rko short comedy series was the 1890's cop james flavin george e stone harry fleer warren parker and milton parsons all rounded out this largely silent cast br br without spilling the beans let's just say that yes there is probably a lesson to be learned here if not the one already mentioned the grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence then how about be careful in what you ask for because you just may get it
<START> fifteen years later and paris is burning is still aflame this is a classic in black gay films right up there with the other honorary black gay films the color purple and mahoganoy this seminal work captures underground and underclass i e underserved black and latin gay culture and community like no other work before or since including all the sentimental harlem rennaissance gay retrospectives and renderings they're good but this is the best dare i say the only real film you'll find on the subject it's relentlessy cunty the classic house music invention comes to hollywood non stop hilarious camp like only we do it and dead on social critique all this by a white female director who obviously must have been a sister gurl or mizz thing in a former life i could go on but i think you get the point by now i love this movie
<START> quite possibly the worst movie i've ever seen i was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes the only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners don't get me wrong i love silly stupid movies just as much as the next gal but the whole premise writing and humor stunk it seemed to me that they were going for a napoleon dynamite feel strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience instead it ended up being forced awkward and weird br br the only bright light was isla fisher and i just felt utterly awful that she and sissy spacek had signed up for this horrible thing br br thank gosh i didn't pay for it
<START> the korean war has been dubbed americas's forgotten war so many unanswered questions were buried along with the 50 thousand men who died there occasionally we are treated to a play or movie which deals with that far off ghostly frozen graveyard here is perhaps one of the finest it's called sergeant ryker the story is of an american soldier named sgt paul ryker lee marvin who is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer his task is to defect to the north koreans and offer his services against united nations forces so successful is his cover he proves invaluable to the enemy and given the rank of major however he is thereafter captured by the americans put on trial as a traitor and spy stating he was ordered to defect he sadly learns his commanding officer has been killed and has no evidence or proof of his innocence he is convicted and sentenced to hang however his conviction is doubted by capt young bradford dillman his prosecutor convincing commanding gen amos baily lloyd nolan of his doubts he is granted a new trial and if found guilty will be executed the courtroom drama is top notch as is the cast which includes peter graves murray hamilton and norman fell as sgt max winkler korea was a far off place but the possibility of convicting a communist and hanging him hit very close to home in the 1950's due to its superior script and powerful message this drama has become a courtroom classic excellent viewing and recommended to all
<START> i would have left the movie halfway through if i hadn't been with people who liked it the movie is based on real incidents but it's so over the top it didn't feel real at all i have some psychological background hang out with a lot of psychotherapists and have known seriously crazy people so it's not that i think people like this don't exist but in the film the only characters who seemed consistently human were augusten's father alec baldwin and the young augusten jack kaedin although evan rachel wood was an intriguing diversion very sexy with a wicked sense of fun there were a few amusing moments but the overall tone of the movie was grim bizarre and nasty what a waste of an outstanding cast as i watched them go through their turns i just felt like i was watching an acting class this was brought home during the credits when a couple of people were shown just sitting there not acting not talking those few moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours
<START> i do not know if this movies problems are more the fault of direction or script as you will see in many reviews the editing style is way overdone it is absolutely distracting and without substance which could be considered a good thing if you look at some of the quotes from the movie i do not write many reviews here but felt this movie was so awful that it deserved comment movies like this erode at movie making as an art form movies like this one show more and more clearly that the current reality focus in cinema is revealing the quality of the characters behind them people hone there craft there 5 senses and there business sense overlooking there own inner life however i do not put blame on them it is more and more the unfortunate condition of this age qualified by films like this one but by proxy these manufacturers i would dare not call artists vomit there lack of inner life or regard onto the screen diffusing it to everyone a story of bounty hunters guns guns and more guns heavy handed flaunting of sex for the oh so popular actress did they write the lap dance scene after they signed her over saturated over exaggerated one liners non linear plots all different and yet all the same annoying overwhelming music to push the emotion down your throat a story a development of character or just withheld missing information revealed at the end to create the effect of a story as if one took place it altogether lacks anything remotely resembling subtlety it is a caricature of stereotypes and genre where are the films with awareness what about subtlety of sound and music that you are not even aware is there what about the depth of a look what about editing with a point about mind and consciousness yes even in action films this can happen sure they have honed a craft but what use is it without soul or wisdom of insight into the human condition can the people who commented and said that this is an apogee of art or compare this to picasso and others i say put this next to gandhi or the godfather even the original trilogy of star wars or the lord of the rings then look me in the face and say it again it is a good crew but they need some help with depth and story i hope they get it because i like the crews previous work better luck next time
<START> lexi befriends jennifer a thin intelligent girl at her new school lexi's parents have just split up soon jen tells lexi of her eating disorder and the two begin dieting and exercising together they both are in the school's volley ball team lexi's mum becomes aware of her daughter's illness as she is losing lots of weight lexi is admitted to hospital she is diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and is made to gain weight her father visits her in hospital and orders a feeding tube she is better and is allowed out of hospital and she tells her mum that jen has bulimia this leads to the two falling out as lexi's mum tells jen's mum her suspicions br br at a party jen is hit by a car and because her heart is weak it kills her lexi's condition worsens as she blames herself for her best friend's death
<START> horrible film with bits of the ramones strewn about your worse than average 1970's 80's comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan this movie is terrible the plot consists of a girl who enjoys the ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration forget this movie and watch something like wild zero starring guitar wolf if you want an entertaining b movie terrible acting terrible writing terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie that is the only logical thing i can think of because this movie blows
<START> yikes it was definitely one of those sleepless nights where i surfed the channels and bumped into this stinker of a movie for some of the names in the cast i'd expect a much better movie i'm almost embarrassed to see oscar winner f murray abraham being reduced to such a horrible part i hope the money was worth it and the students they talked about fencing like they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster i mean i've fenced it's a fun sport but i've never been that intense the only reason i even watched this entire movie was because the remote fell under the sofa and i was too lazy to get it back
<START> first of all this movie reminded me of the old movies i used to have to watch in religion class in school that's not a good thing basically it's just a preachy and pretentious piece of filth just like the terrible left behind series i'm not offended by religious movies but i am offended when these religious movies just happen to be extremely awful i would just like to be able to say nice things about a christian movie but it doesn't look like that will happen any time soon i bet if you gave the bible thumpers a decent budget they still wouldn't be able to come up with anything good just avoid this one also the fact that the american family association basically reverend wildmon's lackies beam about this film on their website is another reason to make me hate it in fact after i viewed this i went home and watched my copy of david cronenberg's nc 17 rated crash forgive me father for i have sinned hahahahaha
<START> this isn't the comedic robin williams nor is it the quirky insane robin williams of recent thriller fame this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over dramatization mixed with robin's new love of the thriller but this isn't a thriller per se this is more a mystery suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper br br also starring sandra oh and rory culkin this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report until william's character gets close to achieving his goal br br i must say that i was highly entertained though this movie fails to teach guide inspect or amuse it felt more like i was watching a guy williams as he was actually performing the actions from a third person perspective in other words it felt real and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story br br all in all it's worth a watch though it's definitely not friday saturday night fare br br it rates a 7 7 10 from br br the fiend
<START> this movie fails miserably on every level i have an idea let's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east maybe if we're lucky they'll all be shot and killed and we won't have to ever have our time wasted by them again did i mention that i have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life my god i can't think of anything i've ever seen that was this bad i'd rather watch ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film if i ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film i'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless that's my two cents
<START> primal species 1996 dir jonathan winfrey br br international terrorists get a surprise when their cargo turn out to contain living dinosaurs the army commando team now have to think fast if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species instead of the reptiles br br you look at the cover and you gain your first impressions of the film that is pretty much it the acting is only just acceptable from a few characters the story is poor with the whole film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs this film came out three years after 'jurassic park' instead this film looks to have come out 13 years before 'jurassic park' the dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made and i do mean costumes there are obviously people dressed up and this film makes no attempts at hiding this a scene when a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way in which it looks like someone is riding the creature the is one good thing which comes out of this film the short running time at only 1 hour and 15 minutes it doesn't waste too much of your life but still try to avoid it altogether br br it's like a friday the 13th nightmare officer brian currie
<START> james j corbett heavyweight champion of the world from 1892 to 1897 turned out to be errol flynn's favorite role possibly because he didn't have to wield a sword or be in a western he grew tired of the swashbucklers and he said in his autobiography that he felt he was miscast in westerns and couldn't understand why people liked him in them it is an enjoyable film but hardly does tell the real story of james j corbett br br as portrayed corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the heavyweight division a man who used brains and speed more than brute strength to win he defeated john l sullivan and lost to bob fitzsimmons the heavyweight crown he was also a compulsive womanizer and in that was a lot like the man portraying him of course that was not shown on the screen the character that alexis smith plays the banker's daughter who falls for him has no basis in reality corbett was in fact married twice and was flagrantly unfaithful with both of his wives br br also though after he lost his title and after the events of this film are concluded he suffered a great personal tragedy his father in a moment of depression probably over finances because he lost heavily betting on his son to beat bob fitzsimmons shot his mother and then turned the gun on himself the murder suicide hardly squares with the happy clan that alan hale presided over br br one thing though that i did like about gentleman jim ward bond got the career role of his life in playing john l sullivan director raoul walsh got a great performance out of bond as the blustering but lovable sullivan even given some of sullivan's bad points that don't make it to the screen like rabid racism bond's portrayal is the quintessential john l and the best thing about gentleman jim br br speaking of racism one thing that should have been told was the fact that sullivan while champion refused on grounds of race to meet peter jackson who was black and from australia and probably the best heavyweight of his time i say probably because as a challenger corbett met him and fought him for 61 rounds to a draw that fight more than any other created a demand for a sullivan corbett title match of course when corbett was champion he refused to give jackson a title shot maybe he didn't want another 61 round marathon with someone who may have been better on that particular day br br gentleman jim is not jim corbett's story it is a movie of errol flynn playing at being james j corbett but corbett had he been alive in 1942 no doubt would have loved the movie and loved flynn's portrayal of his life it's as he would have liked to have been remembered
<START> gods where to start i was only able to stomach about the first 10 minutes before i turned it off in disgust aside from the actor playing robin hood himself the rest were just terrible and i can only stretch my suspension of disbelief only so far br br from the very opening of the first episode i lost count of how many errors plot holes and horrible costumes there were it began with some poor peasant trying to hunt for a deer to feed his family all well and good however the poor blighter must have been mostly deaf because a handful of soldiers in full armour on horseback were able to sneak up on him to within about 10 feet br br then as he's running away he goes from having them 10 feet behind him to a shot where you cannot even see them at all immediately followed by them about 20 feet behind him again then he runs into some bushes and is immediately manhandled by two of the soldiers who just mere seconds before were galloping on horseback dozens of feet behind him br br the armour on the soldiers is so painfully obviously cloth which they tried to make look like maille and miserably failed not to mention the lead soldier's armour being about 5 sizes too big for the poor fellow seriously he looks like he is a small child wearing his father's over sized armour finally robin manages to fire about 5 perfectly aimed shots all around one soldier's hand in the span of about 2 seconds from what appears to be a recurve bow no human alive could make those kinds of shots in that short amount of time with a scoped rifle much less a bow br br after that they escape the soldiers and stop to help an amazingly well dressed and clean peasant with digging a ditch something that all noblemen were willing to do all the time right how this sorry excuse for a series ever got a second season is beyond me the production costs at least for what i saw must have soared in the dozens of dollars or euros br br seriously i think a highschool drama class could have put on a better rendition this was so bad even that terrible kevin costner version of robin hood was better br br i highly suggest you skip this monstrosity and go rent or buy the mid 80's robin of sherwood series much better written acted costumed and produced br br for shame bbc for shame
