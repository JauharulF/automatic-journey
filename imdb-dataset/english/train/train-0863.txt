<START> i have copy of this on vhs i think they the television networks should play this every year for the next twenty years so that we don't forget what was and that we remember not to do the same mistakes again like putting some people in the director's chair where they don't belong this movie rappin' is like a vaudevillian musical for those who can't sing or act this movie is as much fun as trying to teach the 'blind' to drive a city bus br br john hood peebles has just got out of prison and he's headed back to the old neighborhood in serving time for an all to nice crime of necessity of course john heads back onto the old street and is greeted by kids dogs old ladies and his peer homeys as they dance and sing all along the way br br i would recommend this if i was sentimental or if in truth someone was smoking medicinal pot prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma either way this is a poorly directed scripted acted and even produced i never thought i'd sat that satire of ghetto life with the 'hood' although i think the redeeming part of the story through the wannabe gang fight sequences and the dance numbers his friends care about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from being torn down and cleaned up br br forget sonny spoon mario could have won an oscar for that in comparison to this rap oh well if you find yourself wanting to laugh yourself silly and three quarters embarrassed be sure to drink first br br and please watch responsibly no stars better luck next time
<START> i saw this movie in my childhood and after 10 years i did not remember anything about this movie but i found out it i also don't know how i was able to find out this movie its my life my all times favorite movie my words will fall short of true meaning what i have inside for this movie i follow this movie it's a brilliant mix of fantasy comedy romance horror erotic scary and martial arts the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm it's a masterpiece of hong kong cinema br br sinnui yauman is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film written by songling pu and directed by siu tung ching a chinese ghost story has it all ling choi sin played by leslie cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for lodging deep in the woods a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near the trek alone is perilous with wolves and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple br br ling choi sin meets tsing a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple she is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress but when she meets innocent ling choi sin they fall in love br br ling choi sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place while tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods there's great martial arts even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual taoist sword forms the movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films acrobatics with magic and flying through the air leaping from tree to tree with elegant long gowns and scarves but the movie genuinely flows and everything is effective br br tsing is to be married to a evil tree monster which cant be good and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice br br in the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue and go with yin deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls and bring ling's ashes back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation br br a beautiful story that truly pays attention to details one is touched in many ways by this movie you'll laugh cry and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography and though at the end yin and ling choi sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting rainbow we never know if tsing was afforded a reincarnation but we do know her
<START> overlong drama that isn't capable of making any real point so she became an actress so what she learned to love big deal there is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations but the kind which is bad for the movie causing it to often seem absurd br br summer phoenix playing the lead talks and behaves like a semi retarded person so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater which was clearly not the intended point we are told early on in that barry lyndon like narration that she learned to hide her emotions which certainly explains her autistic stone face but the movie suffers for it she basically walks around like a zombie and her success as an actress isn't quite credible given her lack of emotions occasionally the movie had that dull sleepy feel of a dogma 95 movie is it one i wouldn't be at all surprised br br summer phoenix is sister of joaquim phoenix and the late river phoenix nepotism rarely works br br if you'd like to see my hollywood nepotism list with over 350 pictures entries contact me by e mail
<START> this is a very grim hard hitting even brutal film about a death row break that goes awry it's black and white photography keeps it from being dated mickey rooney is excellent as the twisted yet strangely sympathetic lead one of the first movies to portray the psychological desolation of death row it is also quite poignant
<START> this documentary is incredibly thought provoking bringing you in to the lives of two long time lovers who are in the final stages of aids the past footage of their twenty some odd years together really brings their final moments home br br if this movie doesn't make you feel the pain and agony of these two fascinating people you don't have a heart
<START> as i am from hungary i have heard many people saying better and better things about Ãvegtigris so far but actually i don't understand the reason of all the fuss br br i liked many points of the movie some of the quotes really cheered me up but the stereotyped characters are present again like in every hungarian film and the story is also pretty dull i liked the first half but then i started to get bored and then i found the whole film just boring br br rudolf pÃ©ter is good as always reviczky is brilliant also but the others are just there doing nothing br br how many years still have to pass for a good hungarian film
<START> a very addictive series i had not seen an exact combination among drama action suspense and sci fi never before i am impressed every chapter the screenplay is very intelligent i don't know how the creators invent all this amazing stories every character have a strange past troubles stormy relationships it gives to the show the human sense needed for creating intimate characters br br the most incredible is the fact that all the characters are related among them the numbers they have met before without knowing it and so on the others enigmatic security system and the darma initiative are elements that don't let us lose a chapter br br mr jj abrams what did you think to create this amazing story
<START> this documentary is a reenactment of the last few years of betty page's paige richards career the tennessee tease was the most recognizable pin up queen in history her most memorable work came in the 1950's and was fetish photos bondage and cat fight girly flicks irving klaw dukey flyswatter at his movie star news instructed betty on what to do in front of the camera there was no nudity in the famous photos or stag films but nonetheless klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution it is no surprise that betty had a cult following at the height of her career the girl next door with jet black hair blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would mesmerize for decades after all it has been said that she was photographed more than marilyn monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world elvis presley betty page would disappear and devote her last years to religion this movie actually could have been a lot better but good enough to hold interest br br miss richards is stunning in her own right bra panties garter belt and hose do not hurt her image in the least also in the cast jaimie henkin jana strain emily marilyn and julie simone be advised this movie can change your heart rate
<START> unless you are an evangelical christian then make like an egyptian and avoid like the biblical plague br br awful why oh why does imdb list the most favourable reviews at the top of the list it was due to one of these that i have just wasted the end of what started out as good evening on this claptrap br br the plot premise started out strong enough i was drawn into the film and was interested right up to the point where the bible sermons took over what a waste br br this film has so incensed me that i have registered with imdb for the first time just to complain about it i hope at least that by doing so i save someone else's evening br br hay what a christian act on my part
<START> they sell it as a horror movie it's supposed to be a thriller but i found it pretty funny comedy don't think so i laughed the whole movie i think it was because of the ridiculous acting and plot i don't blame the actors i think they were not very good but o k i think cillian is a very good bad guy i loved his acting in batman beggins and rachel mcadams whoa she's a beauty and a good actress as well but let's try to be a little objective here the story mm mm the direction mm mm it lacks a lot of good suspense in fact is a really boring movie but there's one good thing tho it's a short movie only 1 hour and 30 minutes for me it was like 10 minutes under the water br br i just don't know why this movie is rated so high and in rotten tomatoes even higher what's wrong with good rational and objective criticism
<START> average viewers looking for any sense of internal coherence in a film should probably give this one a pass it generates the same feeling as staring at a curious array of individual images that seem to have some relationship one to another but never coalesce into a totality br br while this isolative approach to creating a kind of cinematic montage may appeal to a few students or critics steeped in the inside language of contemporary filmmaking it is flatly irritating and condescending to us commoners who just fell off the haywagon an overt avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of auteurs like kar wai wong and tarantino but to me it comes across as andy warhol warmed over the only redeeming characteristic i find is in the production values and them there just ain't going to cut it all by themselfs br br this is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes sorry the calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to roll just as your interest begins to stir i get the same big yawn and let down reading what i guess are very knowledgeable and thorough comments about this film that never lead to anything truly comprehensible ideas and images without some external context are not my idea of fun br br call me a philistine roaming the streets of hong kong looking for a bowl of chop suey br br
<START> a few summer space campers actually were accidently sent into space by a robot and the oxygen in ship was running short they had to sent someone to a space station to get the gas tanks etc etc br br first of all this movie's plot is not possible in real life but it gives a warm feelings of anything is possible if you set your heart in br br it is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years i saw this movie for the first time in the year of 2000 it was filmed in 1986 there are quite a few people in that movie who are still working in hollywood br br the view was great from outer space it does not look unreal it is about 2 hours long it runs so fast that you won't even notice you know that it is not real but you just get sucked into it until the end br br overall it is a good family movie br br
<START> doppelganger has its moments but they are few and far between br br essentially this is a grade b blend of pop psych thriller ghost story and horror drew barrymore plays a young woman who is haunted by the demons of her past most of her family has been murdered and she was in at least one case the prime suspect or does she just have a really bad case of multiple personality disorder george newbern is her new room mate and most of the action centers on him br br newbern's character is pretty sympathetic and both he and barrymore do decent work though not exactly good the mediocre to at times totally horrendous script and the unimpressive directing seem to have combined to sink the rest of the performances into oblivion leslie hope's character is memorable but so irritating that you will want to forget her br br the plot eventually disintegrates into a bifurcated one story arc is psychological realism the other is supernatural horror outlandish climax which is so badly conceived acted and photographed that it effectively counteracts most of what value the film had achieved previously br br overall the film has the feel of what might expect to be the result of m knight shamalyan's first undergraduate film class the acting and script for the two leads are just good enough to make you care a little about them at least until the film derails utterly and completely br br my recommendation send your doppelganger but avoid a first person encounter
<START> what can you say about the film white fire amazing fantastic disturbing hilarious these words are not big enough to describe the event which is white fire from wobbly garbled beginning to profound end this movie will entertain throughout br br our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world a family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms when the father separates from the mother and their childen you get a real sense of what kind of movie you're about to watch father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit and is polite as he gets people's attention before he shoots them but alas dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised unsafe stunt meanwhile mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them he too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre halt and then promptly wastes the mother this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and ingred br br so now we fast forward about 20 years 30 if you're honest about the hero's age to beautiful turkey where bo and ingred have settled as professional thieves or diamond prospectors or something ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods while bo masterfully played by the dynamic robert ginty drives around the desert in his denim outfits bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship they don't seem to have any friends other than each other and they spend all of their time together that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as you know its a shame you're my sister he says to her while she's stark naked make for a very dynamic duo bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed as he wanders the beaches of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf a renewal of hope occurs when bo finds a girl who looks like ingrid and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas and he is overjoyed with his new love br br so anyway there's a lot of fun action scenes ridiculous violence great acting impossible to follow plot lines fred the hammer williamson for some reason and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond which later explodes all of these things are great but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special really special so i heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is white fire you may be glad you did or not
<START> what exactly was going on during world war 11 in new zealand when american forces were there br br this awful story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to view can you imagine casting joan fontaine as the older sister to sandra dee fontaine looked more like her mother even funnier was that fontaine becomes pregnant in the film br br piper laurie and paul newman who showed such great on screen chemistry 4 years later in the hustler have no scenes together in this film laurie plays another sister who goes off to wellington to tramp around there despite the fact that she is married woe to her when her husband comes back from the war br br jean simmons is widowed and finds romance with a much subdued paul newman there is even romance for the young miss dee here br br the picture has little to no meaning are they trying to say that all is fair in love and war if they are they did a poor job in selling this br br the conflict of interest with newman and simmons is quickly disposed of that is what should have been quickly done to this terribly disappointing film of 1957
<START> this was among the stupidest and preachiest of the anti nuke films out of the 1980s br br the idea that a kid and a basketball star could change the world is pretty far fetched given how many children's peace marches and celebrity protests there were and are br br but the idea that the soviet union would agree to a total nuclear disarmament because some apparatchik kids learned of a silent protest in the west is ludicrous br br what ended the cold war america's tough dare i say reaganesque stance and the internal failures of socialism it was not the peace marches the die ins or films like amazing grace chuck miracle mile or testament
<START> well executed old and very dark house horror good set up which includes the character of poe himself alluding to the story in a london pub although from here it is pretty much the one guy who has taken the dare to visit the house on a particular night running from room to room either looking for or avoiding people it is still most enjoyable plus we have the delightful and enigmatic barbara steele there is some wooden dialogue and some unexplained bits and bobs but it is the super creepy atmosphere that is maintained throughout that and the super musical score that keep this one moving nicely along dvd originates from us and has a few extras
<START> i will never forget when i saw this title in the video store way back when i was always a big weird al fan and when i saw this video i rented and watched it i was too young to appreciate all of al's subtle humor and satire at the time but i remember it much later when i was old enough to understand what i was watching if you are an al fan especially of his earlier work you will thoroughly enjoy this film it is done in the mtv esque rockumentary style and tells a true but sometimes exaggerated tale of how al got to be where he was in 1985 you will love it if you like his brand of humor and more importantly his music
<START> the acting is pretty cheesy but for the people in this area up in the 80s and are now detroit area automotive engineers this is a great movie i even work with a japanese supplier so that makes this movie even more funny br br jay leno was showing his age last night on the tonight show he looks pretty young here 17 years ago the opening scene with the drag race on what appears to be woodward ave was great br br leno also owns some bad a cars now it would e great to see a remake of this with his modern collection i'm sure the blown vette in the opening scene was his own car br br typical 80s movie watch it and enjoy no computer generated crap
<START> interesting to read comments by viewers regarding omega code many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from tbn broadcasts the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video to be stocked besides the three part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the 70s dont remember it you wont remember this one either in a year or two this is the first movie i have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls very shameful this just goes to show that if you are a televangelist's son you too can play high roller hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money
