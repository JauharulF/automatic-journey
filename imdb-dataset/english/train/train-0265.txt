<START> this movie is proof that film noire is an enduring style and extremely worthy of stay alive for me it is he best example of film noire since chinatown br br it will unfortunately never get the recognition it deserves it was never promoted properly when it was first released and has had to build its cadre of fans through venues like vanguard cinema and word of mouth rental referrals br br i highly recommend that people looking for something more than mindless entertainment rent this movie and delved into its highly convoluted plot
<START> this might be the worst film ever made and is possibly worth seeing for that reason alone streisand is laughably unbelievable as a young woman posing as a man in order to study judaism the soundtrack is torturous featuring barbara belting out some of the weakest blather ever put to film and don't even get me started on the plot you will actually get more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it is soooooooo terrible the rampant ego of streisand thinking she could somehow raise this stinker to oscar heights led to this disaster i'm pretty sure the novelist isaac bashevis singer hated this film and never forgave streisand i can't blame him this movie is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of 'the sound of music' being played backwards on an old turntable it's truly that bad i'm amazed that anyone from streisand enjoyed this movie on the level that it was intended

<START> written on the wind is an irresistible wonderfully kinky film as only director sirk could have done it the movie is submerged in a bucket full of freudian symbols weird melodramatics and colorful contrasts the connection between financial success and moral decay is the film's main theme sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism however i prefer to see the movie as a prime example of what sirk could do with kitschy material the palette of colors is particularly impressive the acting in the film is great too rock hudson and lauren bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance but the movie belongs to robert stack and dorothy malone she deservedly won the best supporting actress oscar who manage to keep the film at a boiling point kudos to frank skinner's pulsating score russell metty's brilliant camera work every single shot is a masterpiece in itself and the production design department also the title tune is a beauty it's an unforgettable movie
<START> linda lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater chuck traynor i don't understand how having sex with a dog which is animal abuse as well can be found to be entertaining or funny linda lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films i know some people will criticize this comment but i feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women this society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings we call ourselves civilized however i feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized
<START> it's interesting that a novel with no plot has become the basis for two films while the heiress was a good if not entirely accurate adaptation washington square is a heavy handed and poorly acted except for the part of dr sloper film that could have been so much better br br the director's attempts at making 'beautiful' scenes were so obvious that i actually cringed it has none of the understated and simple beauty that a movie with no plot can have such as onegin i agree with other comments about leigh's portrayal of catherine as an idiot instead of naive and shy she made me despise her not feel for her br br catherine's transition from childlike trusting to adult cynicism the whole point of the story was internalised just as it was in the novel but we don't have the benefit of a narrative voice to tell us that in a film i think someone skipped adaptation class at filmschool br br i appreciate the director's attempts to make a moving and beautiful film out of a difficult text but it just didn't work
<START> users who have rated this movie so highly simply can't have seen enough good films to compare it with have they all been brainwashed i have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie br br from the first bu is just a chase film we pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another and another and another and another do you see a pattern emerging there is virtually no time 'wasted' on plot character development or boring old reality br br if you haven't see the other two bourne films you're pretty lost if you have you only wish you were lost somewhere a long way from a cinema br br paul greengrass's dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on united 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen but on bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character he runs he jumps he punches he gets blown up he clears tall buildings yada yada yada above all he survives he survives like a plastic action man survives which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension so he drives off a building so what he'll survive yawn br br there's a girl thrown into the mix because bourne's love interest died in a previous incarnation but she's just decor i've seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of captain scarlet br br bourne's own journey of literal self discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didn't know from the first movie he was turned into a killing machine big deal he finds out his true identity so what it doesn't have any emotional resonance when it comes br br the 'twist' ending is telegraphed and weak oh dear the more i think about this film the more i hate it i've already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment i'd better end now before the slide continues br br i love a good action flick and i love a good thriller the bourne ultimatum is neither it's a loud tedious series of flashy edits ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence br br the idea that it 'shows the way' to the bond franchise is utter crap casino royale blows it out of the water
<START> i think if you were to ask most jw's whether they expect a miracle cure because of their faith you will find they do not i know i do not what you will find instead is that they believe the promises christ made of a resurrection so even even if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity jehovah can and will correct this br br it really gets down to a simple question is god real to you or is this all just make believe if he is real and you trust him you will follow his directions no matter what the short term outcome may be br br i had a heart attack about a year and a half ago one in my family was horrified when she saw the words no blood written in large letters over my chart i reasoned with her that if i were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life would that be a good time to anger the only one could return me to life when the time came she didn't get it god just isn't real enough to her too bad i wish she could have the comfort a strong faith gives
<START> let me put it another way balls or how about bollo ks this is truly awful more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise julia roberts is a skilled actress and usually her work is of the highest standard this movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient normally she is the consummate professional yet i swear that in her eyes there were signs of bewilderment and despair br br the one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director chris walken turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors unfortunately that theme wasn't explored to it's full potential too little too late br br zeta jones was wooden cusack was cusack and crystal should stick to acting the two talented ex buffy stars had different experiences green hopelessly mis cast and balfour under used well done to julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made
<START> this movie is one of my very favorites it's hard to explain why maybe it's the innocence of corin nemec and his awkwardness paired with the boldness of cheryl pollak but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack also some of the characters have little lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves finally the story is one that always tugs at my heartstrings and the last scene is so bittersweet all in all i love this movie it's perfect for a gooey sentimental girls' night
<START> in the area of movies based off of screenplays from some other area or whatever the title for that oscar is holes has credibility i think it is better to have the author create the screenplay because the author is the creator of the material if the author can't write a screenplay to save their life then have the author and someone fluently talented in the area of screenwriting create it aside from that this review is about holes br br the reasons start here and a spoiler maybe found within 1 louis sachar is an excellent author and it turns that he can write a screenplay i watched the movie and then read the book and both didn't reek incoherence or stupidity some people just have natural talents that can transcend mediums 2 the best performance award goes to shia labeouf for his portrayal as the main character he dug himself into the role i wanted to see his character vindicated before the conclusion 3 to ratchet up the suspense a bit andrew davis was brought in this is the man that made harrison ford run hard and run fast he also can make steven seagal smash some heads as for this film he made shia and the rest of the boys dig some holes in other words he can make an action packed movie and make it well even if action isn't the main genre isn't action 4 my second favorite performance goes to jon voight as mr sir sometimes a goofy role brings out the best in a performer when voight uttered the line once upon a time i must have laughed for half a minute because it was so funny he is capable of comedy and he should investigate a few more roles that let him to exercise that talent 5 tim blake nelson is very solid whenever he is given a solid script this is probably the second best role i have seen him in second only to 'o brother where art thou ' 6 i love the choice of settings for the movie i didn't know california was that dry or that barren i guess population and land area figures both can be misleading 7 the overall look of the movie made me want another bottle of water one could only imagine digging a hole in that barren area for half a day 8 the rest of the cast should deserve a box of kudos bars as well sigourney weaver henry winkler khleo thomas jake m smith and the rest of the bill were tapped because of their talents and it gelled very well great cast even though it was anywhere near ensemble 9 i like a movie that doesn't explain anything right away when stanley got clocked in the head with those baseball cleats it made me want to see how weird the events could get and that is a key ingredient in making a good movie 10 disney pictures not touchstone disney needs to make a few more of these mature juvenile films it was palatable for me and i am a college student the last mature juvenile disney film i saw was something wicked this way comes and holes possibly exceeds it like the election in 2000 it's still to close to call disney can make greatness if they decide to expand on this genre and keeps artistry in mind over milking a cash cow when they see it ten reasons give a score of ten br br all in all holes is one of my favorite disney films and probably one of the best this year granted this movie may not be oscar material but whoever said oscar material is the best material in terms of being a movie from a book i have read this ranks behind fight club on my list which is on top for being a film i saw in 2003 this is in the top five somewhere behind mystic river compared against harry potter stanley yelnats easily takes a shovel to harry's head and brings the final death blow with a smelly sneaker to potter's nose everybody should see this movie because it both informs and entertains here ends my rant
<START> i suppose it was for temple matthews who written basically a remake even though there are few changes which just make it worse spoilers it is much similar to the original melody ariel's new daughter is threatened by ursula's sister morgana morgana escapes but keeps her promise to take melody away from them did ursula have a sister and she is not that great a villain as ursula was this is where there is similarity medoly is kept from the sea until morgana is captured but she doesn't know a thing about it because it all happened when she was a baby a wall surrounds the palace to keep her in and morgana out she goes under the wall day to day to have a swim and talk with sebastian who is not as funny or fun as in the original she finds a seashell with her name on it and runs away from home and to look for answers and finds morgana here is a similarity morgana tricks melody making her happy by turning here into a mermaid meanwhile eric melody and king triton look for her to stay a mermaid she needs to steal the trident from triton so melody does because she does not know king triton is her father she makes friends with a penguin and a walrus and here is where it is awful the penguins who live with them in an icy ocean hate them because they are cowards so they try to prove they are heroes and fail that does not suit the little mermaid and the dialogue during those conversations between the penguins and those two characters is ear bleeding you know why because the first had a great story this one is not and is not magical it is just an example of how bad many sequels are br br melody finds them and they help to take her to atlantica to prove themselves when they take the trident ariel finds melody with morgana melody is angry at her mother for keeping her from the sea so she gives the trident to morgana then she shows her true colours once she grabs it poor ariel and melody are in her custody the penguin and the walrus begin to prove themselves when they fight morgana's shark friend sorry i did not mention him earlier they finally prove themselves eric king triton and his soldiers arrive but are forced to bow down before morgana by the power of the trident melody takes it throws it to triton and he ices morgana literally then ariel apologises to melody and thinks it is all her fault it was not ariel did the right thing to protect melody but they never say so triton offers melody to live in sea or land she in fact has a better idea she uses the trident to vaporize the wall so humans and mer folk can be together then everyone sings an awful song the end br br whoever has seen it and likes this obviously has not seen the original i do not dislike this because i am a teenager i liked it when i was very very little then as i grew older i began to see what is bad about this film young young kids will enjoy it but it is likely that when they are in primary school they will forget about it normally i would think i over judged a film and it was better than i remember when i watched it again but not this one it is even worse story is no exception if you thought by reading this that the story is good read more of this comment and you will know the other bad points well you know the story now i am sorry for spoiling it for you but i had to point out some bad parts of it one of the worst things is the animation colour is awful the original had beautiful colour watching this almost made me want to go blind even the illustrations and landscape design were not good the original had beautiful magical colouring and beautiful underwater landscape design and for land as well making it a joy to watch br br the music is unbearable compared to the first the music here is crap songs are not that well composed and tara strong i think that is her name who did melody can not sing she at times either sang too high or did not keep track for the melody in the song so much for having melody as a name and the music is not at all beautiful or moving little mermaid 1 won an oscar for it and it truly deserved it this one deserved a razzie award for worst musical score in a sequel if it would exist br br i did not like the voices several people who played characters from the first did the same ones in this jodi benson is a great singer but now that she is older no offence to her her voice is too deep and not so beautiful anymore and i am really disappointed in her and others who were in the first for being a part of this if i was chosen for this film just by reading the script i can tell it would be a bad film the characters are different now ariel is more wiser now but annoying they overdid her character making her too mature in sequels you are not meant to change the characters unless it is for a special reason she was sixteen in the first there is little chance she changes that is the stage when you become the person you are going to be for the rest of your life screenwriters should think of that they should think of the character br br well i suppose that is it for me i hope you find my comment useful because i am sure a lot of you will agree with my point of view
<START> i must admit i am a big fan of south park and was expecting basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be i think this is what happens when you mix david zucker matt stone and trey parker together this movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously the slap stick style humor mixed with stone and parker just works flawlessly the kind of humor present in basketball was not popular upon the time of it's release and had it come out today it would be a hit don't bother trying to be critical just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor
<START> although i don't usually go for relentlessly heartwarming fare like this i happened to catch the 1994 version of angels in the outfield aito on cable one saturday morning just as it was starting being an adrien brody fan i was curious to see what brody was like as a youth of 21 20 when he filmed it i suppose in this early role as danny hemmerling utility infielder for the california angels in the 1951 original the hard luck baseball team was the pittsburgh pirates the name change is a nice touch since it turns the title into wordplay i decided to give the flick a chance and it turned out to be a pretty painless even amiable experience with a decent balance of laughs tears sweetness and baseball based excitement also my 7 year old daughter liked the angel effects directed by mike nesmith's frequent collaborator william dear aito is the story of roger joseph gordon levitt a foster child who prays real hard after his ne'er do well dad the convincingly sleazy dermot mulroney sarcastically says they'll be a family again once the last place california angels win the pennant soon roger starts seeing real angels at the angels' games led by christopher lloyd whose usual zany eccentric irreverence keeps aito from plummeting irretrievably into the schmaltz zone crusty manager george knox danny glover in world weary exasperated mode is a hard sell but once the team starts winning he believes roger's angel sightings and soon knox has roger and his cute li'l pal and fellow foster kid j p the adorable milton davis jr at every angels game for good luck knox even starts toning down his own temperamental outbursts and profane language as much to appease the angels as for the kids' sake resulting in a funny bit when he starts dressing down an umpire in his usual way but starts editing himself as he goes along predictable obstacles ensue such as obnoxious sportcaster ranch wilder jay o sanders trying to make trouble for knox because of the angel angle sure it all works out fine for our heroes in the end but they're so darn amiable you don't mind baby faced brody has a couple of good lines i especially like his exchange with glover about the emotional impact of the national anthem at a ballgame as well as a cute bit where a pretty blonde angel massages his shoulders before he goes up to bat brody isn't the only future star in aito's lineup his teammates include matthew mcconaughey and neal mcdonough and of course young gordon levitt went on to co star in tv's 3rd rock from the sun as well as such films as 10 things i hate about you the always amusing taylor negron and oscar winners but not for this film brenda fricker and ben johnson lend able support if you're a baseball fan who wants to rent a movie appropriate for the kids and check out some notable young actors before they became stars aito '94 will do nicely
<START> this movie deserves more than a 1 but i'm giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a 10 resulting in it getting a rating that'll take it into the top 100 list seriously it's not that great its not that bad its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it's ridiculous these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say i'm rick james b tch no matter how old or annoying it gets i dread having to hear i'm tired of mfn snakes on this mfn plane months from now from idiots trying to be funny its crappy plot crap acting etc its okay to love a bad movie but you still gotta admit its a bad movie br br wait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie
<START> after seeing dick tracy in the 6 99 bin at future shop i decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of mafia and crime movies i was very surprised to see a very fun smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout the movie moves along well it has of course another solid performance from warren beatty but the real standouts of the film are al pacino and madonna i was happy to find out that pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city madonna was great as the damsel in distress she really impressed me and added depth to her performance if you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give dick tracy a try i don't think you will be disappointed and watch for the cameos from paul sorvino james caan kathy bates and dustin hoffman among others
<START> be careful with this one once you get yer mitts on it it'll change the way you look at kung fu flicks you will be yearning a plot from all of the kung fu films now you will be wanting character depth and development you will be craving mystery and unpredictability you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops sadly you won't find all of these aspects together in one kung fu movie except for five deadly venoms br br easily the best kung fu movie of all time venoms blends a rich plot full of twists and turns with colourful and developed characters along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the 70s the success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which and who specializes in what venom one is the centipede two is the snake three is the scorpion four is the lizard and five is the toad each character has different traits characteristics strengths and weaknesses therein lies the hook we learn along with the student character finding out who these different men turn out to be we are in his shoes so to speak and we have to pick who we trust and who we don't just like he does we learn along with him br br not only is the plot the characters and the camerawork great it's also fun to watch which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it's kind it's worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that's going on venoms is a lesson on what kung fu can really do just don't expect many other kung fu films to live up to it's gauntlet
<START> think stage play this is worth seeing once for the performances of lionel atwill and dwight frye compare the melvyn douglas in ghost story with the melvyn douglas of this film are there vampires at loose in this 'bavarian' village or is there a more natural albeit equally sinister explanation dwight frye is herman a red herring who is cast as an especially moronic character it's fun to look at his different facial expressions in what is really a stock character not much happens for a long time but then we discover that atwill's pipe smoking doctor is the real murderer there is too much 'comic relief' but that is par for the course for this era fay wray looks really good
<START> budget limitations time restrictions shooting a script and then cutting it cutting it cutting it this crew is a group of good young filmmakers thoughtful in this script yes allegorical clever in zero dollar effects when time and knowledge is all you have relying on actors and friends and kind others for their time devotion locations and getting a first feature in the can a 1 in 1000 thing these guys make films good ones check out their shorts collection heartland horrors and see the development and i can vouch working with them is about the most fun thing you'll do in the business i'm stymied by harsh insulting criticism for this film wondering if one reviewer even heard one word of dialogue pondered one thought or concept or if all that was desired of this work was the visual gore of bashing and slashing to satisfy some mindless view of what horror should mean to an audience let the empty acre bring itself to you don't preconceive what you expect it should be just because it gets put in the horror thriller genre due to its supernatural premise it's a drama with depth beyond how far you can stick a blade into someone with a reverence for a message that doesn't assault your brain's visual center but rather draws upon one's empathetic imagination to experience other's suffering of mind and spirit mark ridgway curtis the empty acre
