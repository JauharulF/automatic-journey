<START> page 3 out of 4 stars br br madhvi konkona sen enters her boyfriend's house and its empty she looks here and there and then goes in his bedroom and you get the picture 'ah another girl Â that two timing baddie and yes indeed he his two timing her but it's a guy this time around and i say 'brilliant ' br br end of spoilers the above scene is not a spoiler really but for me it was so i didn't want to take a chance br br when asked upon as how was this film my friend answered 'oh it just an exposÃ© of the p3 people' which made me believe that ill be watching a stupid movie if nothing more when i went to the theater i thought to myself '' i better get a pen and a paper to jot down the bad things about this film'' but i was proved entirely wrongÂ and then some because i could muster only the goods this film was great great not because it is offbeat and noncommercial cinema like storyline but because of the cleverness in the screenplay and how this movie tells you how to handle a movie brilliantly which could have been a dumb and senseless movie if given in the wrong hands br br konkona sen sharma is grace she is so damn beautiful who has nailed her role perfectly as if she was born to play this part one of the most charming actresses i've ever seen but this is not the only performance which is good in the film there's sandhya mridul boman irani and atul kulkarni particularly sandhya mridul who just fires up the screen and guess what even the unusually accented tara sharma speaks normally br br the movies stars off with some silly old parties of the hush hush celebrities of the film industry et al and you get the idea of what this movie will be about and for about half hour through the film you feel just about the same but then the movie picks up the pace grabs onto a good storyline and never lets go of it even boman irani agrees to that statement Â 'it was a good story madhvi' thank you the great thing is that it tackles the issue of how silly these people are with style and does not make it over done and also tackles the social issues and does not make them boring in the end its all a roller coaster ride and madhvi informs us that by just smiling at all these people just the reason why i love watching films ecstatic film making the screenplay is beautiful clever and witty
<START> although it has been remade several times this movie is a classic if you are seeing it for the first time creative dialog unique genius in the final scene it deserves more credit than critics have given it highly recommended one of the best comedies of recent years
<START> i'm not sure what hk movies the other reviewers have been watching but enter the eagles is nowhere near the top of the heap in hk action michael fitz wong should be glad he can get acting jobs in hk because he couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag in english shannon lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter even better with the leg fighting than her dad but her acting skills are also sub par in fact all the english dialog 90 of the movie even more than in gen y cops is so bad that i switched to mandarin audio just to spare myself the misery of the bad dialog delivery and the redundancy of the english subs sure there are some decent gunfights but nothing we haven't already seen before and good cinematography but the cheesy visual effects really spoil the action br br that said it's worth the price of admission to watch shannon and benny the jet urquidez go at it spectacular and almost worth watching the rest of the movie for br br finally you might notice some scenes that seem familiar to you notably a shootout at an outdoor market think matrix and fitz diving out of a helicopter wearing black fatigues think mi 2 guess someone thought at least a few things in this flick were worth ripping off
<START> this is one of the very worst films clark gable made only parnell was obviously worse it is just so painfully clichÃ©d and the dialog is so lousy that it is something neither gable nor jean harlow should have been proud of making br br gable is a heel whose illegal activities result in his girl going' to the slammer like the gangster talk she holds out hope that he'll do the right thing but he just leaves her there unknown to either of them gosh that she's in the family way eventually the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow they tie this all together into a happy ending they seemed to have forgotten about gable's needing to take the rap and spend several years in the hoosegow leonard maltin says the stars are at their best here by what standard best at producing unintended chuckles gimme a break br br ps after saying this my wife thinks leonard maltin is going to find me and kick my butt hmmm however despite my comment i think mr maltin is the finest reviewer and human being on the planet i hope that appeased him br br update 2 2 08 because i disliked this film so much the first time especially the ridiculous ending i decided to watch it once again after all sometimes when i watch a film again i like it much more and realize that i was a bit too harsh while that has been the case with several films in recent months i still disliked this film even the second time most of it was not because of the first half of the film in the first half harlow's character was amazingly stupid but at least it was believable but when she was sent to prison it was all clichÃ©s until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred the bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumb it just makes no sense at all and is akin to turning the movie into some wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two cons i stand by my original review despite all the not helpfuls and think that aside from parnell and possibly polly at the circus it might just be the worst gable film
<START> short synopsis br br this film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men one of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the christmas holidays hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids so it is really serious with exposed well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape Â only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women one gets caught the other remains free and is not given away by his companion a last encounter a last light for a cigarette adieu l'ami farewell friend br br i found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters played by classical he man superstars alain delon and charles bronson they are obviously attracted to each other their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout the whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow a little like deliverance it is also very stylish the safe the two men want to crack is in a Â for the time Â ultra modern glass and aluminum tower it is the seat of a publicity firm so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around the wardrobe is also very good the ultra stylish citroen ds maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times features large in this movie Â perhaps a subtle kind of product placement br br i can recommend this movie for the actor's performances alone delon and bronson are really sharing the top billing in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting both do a considerable amount of acrobatics i have never seen bronson better than here he really acts and speaks french throughout with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed and it is certainly the man himself we hear so the french language version is highly recommended the police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite franch character actors bernard fresson who was gene hackman's partner in french connection ii he is the best brainy police inspector i know also very good is former child actress brigitte fossey as the young ingÃ©nue who as it turns out is not so innocent as it first seems br br anyone who expects the Âold in an out of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film for those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake
<START> i loved this series when it was on kids wb i didn't believe that there was a batman spin off seeing as the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997 first of all i loved the idea of robin leaving batman to solve crime on his own it was an interesting perspective to their relationship i also liked the addition of tim drake in the series and once again like it's predecessor this show had great story lines great animation better then the original fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing the only thing that i didn't like was that was when it was in the us it would often run episodes in a 15 minute storyline i just wish some of the episodes could be longer my favorite episode of any batman cartoons comes in this series and it's called over the edge in my opinion as good if not better then heart of ice and robin's reckoning overall a nice follow up along with superman this show made my childhood very happy
<START> despite some moments in heavy rain an encounter with a drunk as well as an organ grinder with a gypsy and a monkey and a stay in a sanitarium this roscoe fatty arbuckle silent comedy short with support from buster keaton and al st john is only fitfully amusing though there is a quite funny sequence of arbuckle in drag flirting with buster that's the ultimate in meet cute scenes especially since it's one of the few times we see the great stone face smile and laugh in the movies also many scenes seem to have been jump cut edited possibly because of overuse of the film stock still if you're an arbuckle or keaton completist good night nurse is certainly worth a look
<START> nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin 90's as classics people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days and while some of those shows were are undoubtedly good this one is just pure crap i watched this show a lot back in those days since it got a lot of reruns on tv back then and even as a child i didn't like it even a 8 year old can see how much the people in power rangers are overacting and how much the special fx sucked even back then when the show doesn't resort to the painfully bad 'fighting' scenes it plagues the viewer with this unnecessary soap opera about a group of teens and they'r little social problems every now and then i don't know about you but i didn't give a rats ass about any of that at all and its basically filler until they have to 'fight' some dude again in a very clichÃ© alien costume with fireworks or some toy robot you never feel 'involved' in some kind of way with this show and the fact that most of the actors act like there really have no interest at all besides they'r wallet just enhances the lack of feeling br br there is really nothing memorable about this show and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin offs beetleborgs is a good example all it is is just a quick way to make some money though i challenge any 'fan' to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because i couldn't find anything that is even slightly appealing to children my guess is that most 'fans' of power rangers will tell me that i just don't get it anyway or something along that line i really don't care though this was crap back then and it still crap now
<START> lars von trier's europa is a worthy echo of the third man about an american coming to post world war ii europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mystery br br jean marc barr plays leopold kessler a german american who refused to join the us army during the war arrives in frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the zentropa railway what he doesn't know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called the werewolves who target american allies leopold is strongly against taking any sides but is drawn in and seduced by katharina hartmann barbara sukowa the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company her father was a nazi sympathizer but is pardoned by the american colonel harris eddie considine because he can help get the german transportation system up and running again the colonel soon enlists or forces leopold to be a spy without giving him a choice or chance to think about it to see if the werewolves might carry out attacks on the trains br br soon leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noir ish way where everyone and everything is not what it seems its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything his lover the terrorists the colonel annoying passengers his disgruntled uncle even the railway company's officials who come to examine his work ethic before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control the film is endlessly unpredictable br br the film stylishly shot it always takes place at night during the winter with lots of falling snow its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout also background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front add max von sydow's hypnotic narration and europa becomes a dreamlike place that's out of this world br br this is now a personal favorite film of mine
<START> la teta i la luna the breast and the moon describes the life of a 9 10 year old boy named tete who is obsessed with breasts growing up in catalunya i love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human like all the characters in bigas luna's movies also director of jamon jamon tete reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life can be at that age also being from catalunya north east of spain it brought lots of memories to my mind this movie shows how beautiful catalunya is nice people nice life and specially lots of non uptight people
<START> i used to love this movie as a kid but seeing it again 20 years later it actually sucks up the academy might have been ahead of it's time back in 1980 but it has almost nothing to offer today movies like caddyshack and stripes hold up much better today than this steaming dogpile no t a no great jokes except for the one liners we've all heard a million times by now br br i recently bought the dvd in hopes that it would be the gem i remembered it being well i was way off the soundtrack had only 2 3 widely recognizable hits not the smash compilation others had mentioned and the frequent voice overs were terrible the only thing that was interesting to me was predicting what the character's lines were before they said them yep i watched this movie that much back then br br the only reason i am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten sorry to say
<START> this story is dedicated to women according to the introduction who have been fighting for their rights ever since adam and eve started the loose leaf system when politics was filmed the nineteenth amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote was only a decade old and the film deals with the wielding of political power by women as a voting group advocating prohibition and shutting down speakeasies was a main concern for women at the time br br good natured marie dressler as hattie burns becomes politically active after a young woman is shot and killed coming out of a speakeasy she wants the liquor selling joints closed and is drafted into a mayoral run after delivering a powerful speech at a women's rally ms dressler is supported by her tenants best friend polly moran as ivy higgins and her stuttering husband roscoe ates as peter higgins dressler's run for mayor of lake city draws opposition from men in town so dressler orders the women to go on strike denying them everything in the parlor bedroom and bath br br the film sounds much better than it turned out the humor frankly isn't too good and it features some unfunny and moderately offensive situations you look like madame queen refers to an amos and andy character and the mixing of shootings and slapstick doesn't mix well this time producers might have considered making the film more dramatic focusing exclusively on dressler and the characters played by william bakewell as benny emerson and karen morley as myrtle burns br br politics 7 25 31 charles reisner marie dressler polly moran roscoe ates
<START> probably jackie chan's best film in the 1980s and the one that put him on the map the scale of this self directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes during which a squatters' village and shopping mall are demolished there are clearly differences between the original chinese and dubbed english versions with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter the latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their chinese originals in fact the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trialÂat the time trials in colonial hong kong were conducted in english while the original has this scene in cantonese br br nonetheless chan's fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible so non cantonese audiences don't miss much it's not after all the dialogue that makes a chan flick but the action and the painful out takes the story is easy to follow chan plays an incorruptible hong kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather cho yeun and assigned to protect a star witness brigitte lin the action is superb from beginning to end and there's not much time to breathe in between it'll never get you thinking but what an entertaining and well strung together film arguably this is one of the best martial arts films out there
<START> i wanted to punch the tv watching it was torture i hated it never watch this movie the terrorists are annoying adam sandler is annoying i normally like him but not in this one i wanted to break the dvd this is the most irritating film in the world the comedian he's jealous of is obnoxious the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls it was so irritating i wanted to punch the tv do not buy this movie unless you want to annoy someone if you even like adam sandler a little bit don't buy it it will just make you hate him do yourself a favor if you see it in the store hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it its a waste of the 1 99 i paid for it
<START> this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young it had everything that was great with 90's kids movies lovable dinosaurs cute kids an eccentric villain and a few great songs and not the typical little mermaid beauty and the beast type songs but ones that are atually entertaining i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations sorry not the most informative i'm in kinda a rush just please trust me all who go against this movie are killing their inner child
<START> having low expectations going in the opening new footage clocked at over five minutes of 'husbands' came as a pleasant surprise i won't say the new footage was grade a material but it provided a very solid foundation for what could have been a good all original film br br unfortunately this was put together in 1955 during a time of one day shooting schedules after the new footage jules white decided to just thumbtack stock footage from 'brideless groom' into this short making for a not so smooth story transition which jules and felix adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new footage at the end giving us the old worn out ending of the boys moe larry in this case getting shot in the butt br br 3 10
<START> probably encouraged by admirers of her much better orlando potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way she writes directs stars and actually co writes the music including a mawkish love song the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her but potter's character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango perhaps if she hadn't cast herself it might have worked she just can't act whether playing herself or not pretentious over ambitious dull and silly
<START> this movie is deeply idiotic a man wants revenge for a crime but when he enacts his revenge there is a video camera pointed right at him the entire time what man with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do this for so long in front of a video camera br br just the fact that this script could never even happen except with someone unable to dress themselves destroyed it for me but it got dumber br br i am thinking the script writers have some serious habits that are cooking their brain cells and making them miss plot holes you can drive an battalion of armored tanks through br br plot a man seeks revenge for the death of loved ones but in the middle of the plot something goes totally wrong and then the unexpected unfolds br br if only these people writing this story hadn't been so dumb as to write totally unrealistic plot turns that could never happen this way to the writers i say seek help for your serious mental problem
<START> i saw this movie in the theater when it came out i grew up in scottsdale and i went to arizona state and really enjoyed seeing locations where i spent so much time i remember at the time thinking that barbara's venture into more of a rock sound actually r and b to my ears was a successful one i was never a fan of kris's singing until his last effort for new west as a songwriter and an actor though he has serious chops imho i think it is a fine romance i like it better than the judy garland version and never saw selznick's janet gaynor original br br i do believe that they made some changes in this long awaited dvd release among other things i recall the helicopter shot which reveals a packed sun devil stadium being longer and more dramatic i wish they had done a better job writing music for kris or god forbid put some of his original songs in there br br along those lines i have some information from a primary source that says that the music was a problem for kris and barbara while doing interviews for my own new music documentary rocking the boat a musical conversation and journey i interviewed stephen bruton a fine singer songwriter guitarist with close professional and personal ties to kris bonnie raitt and delbert mcclinton among many others stephen was in speedway the john norman character's band kris was having a real hard time turning what was essentially a pop score into something that could pass for rock stephen was and is kris's friend and long time band member there was tension on the set and at one point the band was barking at kris in barbara's presence she remarked to the effect that the band shouldn't talk to him like that kris came right back to the effect that they were his friends and they were rock and roll in the end barbara came around and decided to use kris's band's live performances in the movie and specifically sited stephen's role in making things work i gained even greater respect for her as an artist upon hearing this story much is made of her as a diva what she is is a pro and i am not gay not that there is anything wrong with that
<START> although the actors do a convincing job playing the losers that parade across the screen the fact that these characters are impossible to identify with had me looking at my watch a mere 20 minutes into the film and more than once after that the plot development is disjointed and slow the verbal diarrhoea of the main character's only friend is practically insufferable the base quality of most of the characters actions and the cavalier way in which they are treating is annoying br br it is typical of ventura pons to put forth crass psychologically handicapped characters however this faux sociological analysis is a big step down from caricias or caresses where the characters maltreat and despise each other for well founded reasons that play out during that film in amor idiota we are forced to follow the meanderings of a truly subnormal intelligence as he stalks a severely depressed and detached woman supposedly this is due to his own depression but the script doesn't support that i won't give away the rest of the story just in case there are any masochists out thereÂ is he cured through his obsession or is the woman shocked out of her own depression through his unwavering attention even though i watched the whole thing i wasn't made to care even for a moment about either of them br br if you can sit through all this prejudice ignorance betrayal bad dialogue flimsy philosophy etcÂ the camera work was pretty good and seems to be something inspired by the dogma group the makeup also seemed to aim at showing these players in a raw and gritty light as it is the worst i've seen cayetana guillen cuervo in any of her movies while in person she is actually attractive br br i suppose if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower strata of society so we can be grateful we are not part of it then pons has achieved his objective the barrage of nearly identical sex scenes was a proper waste of film if the actors had been filmed but once in blue green clothing the background behind them could have been changed in the special effects studio for a pittance true that i heard much of the male audience squirm in their seats during this but an objective viewing proves that was not the real aim of those scenes br br save yourselves and watch something else
