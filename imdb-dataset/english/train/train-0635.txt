<START> there is no suspense in this serial when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day no in fact the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode this show is so boring that i can't see how it ever got made let alone released on dvd obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films but even the script is awful an incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that i am not quite sure because it is too awful to follow watch the 60s version or the 90's versions or even batman begins just anything over this version
<START> this is one of the worst written movies i've ever had to sit through br br the story's nothing new but it's a cartoon so who cares as long as it's pretty and fun br br i'm not going to go as deep as the characterisations or i'll be here all day except to say that there aren't any the characters change personality whenever it's convenient to the plot but whoever wrote the script and visual direction should be forbidden access to so much as pencil and paper thumbs down i'd vote to cut their thumbs off br br narrow in on an object prop cut back to character close up character gives a knowing look which the audience will not even remotely understand repeat that several times with different objects props br br make the characters pay no attention at all the huge lumps of rock are floating around crashing into each other generally raining destruction all over and which could kill them all at any moment but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see a harmless looking almost pastoral green rock in the distance br br the whole thing is a long succession of events actions and behaviour that are only there for the convenience of the writer to save him having to think or make any effort at all to write the story properly br br this is the plan 9 of cg cartoons except that it doesn't have ed wood groan factor to make it fun to watch br br do yourselves a favour spend your cartoon budget on pixar movies
<START> meatball machine is an amazing splatter film it has an original plot with young love buckets of blood and weird alien creatures that mutate people into freakish robotic war machines br br now the film isn't for everyone people who love splatter films or the movie tetsuo the iron man will applaud it br br the special effects can be cheesy at some points of the film but your not exactly suppose to take the film very seriously br br yet all in all it's a lot of fun well if you find budding romantics infested with slimy tumor like gobbles who seek to destroy each other in bloody alien oozing battles
<START> an ultra modern house in an affluent neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre and deadly behavior or at least that is what lara flynn boyle's character col kennedy argues after a series of deadly occurrences in a gargantuan house next door col knows something has got to give mark paul gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect br br my opinion the house next door works because of lara flynn boyle and the locations beautiful house and stylish sets boyle is a talented and dynamic actress not to mention absolutely stunning she brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing without her it would have failed it's so alive declares a prospective buyer in reference to the house yes it is alive but the story itself is not so much br br barring boyle's presence not much is happening here as an enormous amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners the results are predictable but i liked it anyway the cinematography lends the film a polished look 8 10 on account of boyle the premise of an evil ultra modern house the locations and cinematography and set decoration and wardrobe
<START> doyle had never wanted to resurrect holmes from his joint death with professor moriarty in the adventure of the final problem however financial considerations made him willing in 1901 to write the hound of the baskervilles which is still considered his best holmes' novel and possibly his best novel but it was a memoir of the great detective written before his death only a greater outcry from his public led doyle to fully resurrect holmes in the adventure of the empty house published in 1905 br br it is not that the new short stories and the last novel are really bad maybe three of the stories are really terrible but even the terrible ones are very readable several of the later ones like the adventure of the solitary cyclist are really very good but the unevenness of production in particularly after the stories in his last bow 1917 become increasingly apparent he repeats past story lines and he shows really negative aspects of holmes in the story the adventure of the three gables holmes shows a sneering sarcasm at a character who is of african ancestry br br spoiler coming up br br the adventure of charles augustus milverton deals with holmes trying to recover compromising letters from milverton a hugely successful blackmailer it is an interesting example of how doyle could make a highly readable story with a minimum of plot for there is little real detective work in the tale holmes is hired to try to negotiate with milverton regarding the purchase of the letters but to get them back no matter what milverton proves not only unwilling to consider a smaller amount for the papers but prepared to protect himself from holmes attempting a search of his person later we learn holmes has gotten into the household of milverton by romancing a maid while disguised at the end holmes goes with watson to burglarize milverton's home he and watson are in the house when they find that milverton is awaiting some new business deal in his study someone with information that milverton can use carefully hiding holmes and watson watch as a woman comes in who turns out to be a victim of collateral damage from milverton's past activities and who shoots the blackmailer to death holmes and watson are able to set fire to milverton's collection of compromising documents before fleeing the house and subsequently discover for themselves the identity of the woman the police under lestrade don't discover who the two mysterious men seen running from milverton's home are and they are so disgusted by milverton's activities they never were able to bring anything home against him that it is obvious the murder will never be solved br br the tale is not one of the fascinating ones with real detective work involved like the adventure of the speckled band or silver blaze it is a tale of mood and late action the issue being will holmes and watson get the papers or will they be caught by milverton it is not one of the best stories but it is in the bulk of the tales as being really well told and interesting br br at the time he wrote charles augustus milverton conan doyle had an experience with the police regarding his sometimes activities as a highly respected amateur detective crusader an artist was found murdered in his studio in london and conan doyle began writing his opinions about how the killing was committed then he stopped apparently warned by his friends at scotland yard that the murder did not bare looking into the victim had been a homosexual and the police were certain that it was a lover's spat gone horribly wrong for the sake of the family of the victim this was in 1905 doyle dropped his interest in the case so he was aware that sometimes the british police behaved with restraint on matters that did not seem to justify their full probing as lestrade's restraint towards whoever did kill the villainous milverton in the story br br given the description of the story it could have been told in the normal hour long version of the series but the teleplay for the master blackmailer spent some time showing the horrible dilemma milverton's victims in victorian edwardian england faced we see a promising young aristocratic army officer kill himself when faced with a homosexual exposure because of milverton's extravagant demands all at the start of the teleplay and it is not only homosexuals men and women of good reputation in heterosexual marriages could be smeared by uncovering illegitimate children or past indiscreet relationships indeed in the story the woman who kills milverton is avenging the destruction of her husband a prominent nobleman destroyed by the blackmailer br br milverton is well played at his most poisonous blandness by that fine actor robert hardy who even when confronted by the unexpected furies he has unleashed is totally unperturbed he looks like he will just have the angry woman showed out of his home in a moment brett and hardwicke do quite well in their holmes and watson roles as to be expected br br how serious was the loss of character by rumor or innuendo in 1905 in 1898 one of the heroes of the various imperial wars and the leader of the last victorious charge at the battle of omdurman that destroyed the mahdist army see four feathers was sir hector macdonald he was governor of ceylon in 1903 when he suddenly unexpectedly resigned sir hector returned to london and shot himself in a hotel while awaiting some sort of hearing it later came out that fighting mac frequently considered the most popular army commander in britain had been caught having sleeping arrangements with native boys milverton would have eaten him up very quickly or his real life counterparts would have
<START> i enjoyed this movie very much kristy swanson omar epps and ice cube were all great in it the movie dealt with many issues and i didn't know if i was going to like it but singelton did a terrific job of creating characters that you really cared about
<START> superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80's exploitation hooray the pre credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we're up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles rough fist fights lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity bo and ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister's naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes well bo does that to his sister and judging by her dubbed laughter she doesn't mind at all sick dude anyway as kids they fled from russia with their parents but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy a friendly smuggler took custody over them however and even raised and trained bo and ingrid into expert smugglers when the actual plot lifts off 20 years later they're facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable white fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of white fire but it sure is a lot of fun to watch most of the time you have no clue who's beating up who or for what cause and i bet the actors understood even less but whatever the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly Â and i won't reveal for what reason Â bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes bo's principal opponent is an italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film there's the obligatory we're falling in love montage and loads of other attractions my god what a brilliant experience the original french title translates itself as life to survive which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie none
<START> flynn known mostly for his swashbuckling roles and his bedroom antics takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully playing real life boxing champ jim corbett flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled san francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist all the while setting one eye on society deb smith he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men and a dog including a prominent judge the next day he gets a chance via smith to gain entrance to the judge's private club he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club's resident boxer his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers up to and including the world champion john l sullivan bond flynn is downright magical here he is the epitome of charm charisma and appeal in this role he looks terrific especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit and does virtually all of his own stuntwork impressively his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for flynn at this stage he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time and she does so admirably she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell bond is incredibly burly brawny and towering yet tender when the script calls for it amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient carson frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynn's manager the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynn's rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed a few of the sets are amazingly presented some of smith's gowns border on the garish but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well it's a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing but it's also so much more some of it like the character traits shown by flynn is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes but a lot of it is authentic like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes one line is particularly memorable i believe you like me more than i like you but it's entirely possible that i love you more than you love me it's classic romantic dialogue and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well
<START> to my surprise i really enjoyed disney's latest animation installment the film had its lows but overall i felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to it was also pleasant to see an animated disney film that was not a musical i was about pushed to the limits with tarzan thankfully they gave the music thing a rest another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down a la hercules rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupid br br one disappointment was the animation with all the great animated films happening outside disney studios you would think they would move along and catch up a little there is something to say about tradition but imagine the possibilities with the story of atlantis overall the film was entertaining and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex br br
<START> the rainmaker released in 1956 has some of the finest actors of its time katharine hepburn lloyd bridges and burt lancaster being the principle players not even they can save this completely over acted melodrama first of all hepburn is horribly miscast as a shy spinster despite her brilliance as an actress not even she can pull this off she is too strong to be credible as being this much of a simpleton and was just too old for the part lancaster over acts to the extreme and earl holliman is way too hammy and comes off more like jethro clampett only bridges and the ever reliable wendell corey seem to rise above the cast a bit but even they can only do so much it seems like the 1950's was a time when katharine hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress and that is fine she just made a bad choice here fortunately for her fans me being among them she didn't make too many of them despite an a list cast and good production values it doesn't work
<START> this movie surprised me in a good way from the box i got the impression that it was an action thriller but it was too funny to be a thriller even though it was somewhat exciting br br there's a lot of nice one liners and funny situations in this movie and james belushi was born to do bill manucci he does a great job the rest of the cast ain't half bad either and especially timothy dalton is a treat br br the story can get pretty confusing at times as new characters shows up during the film things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things if you don't pay attention things might get a bit messy in the end but i really liked it br br louis morneau isn't all that well known but he has done a perfectly ok job with this one and i never really grew impatient while watching the movie br br made men is well worth checking out
<START> i watched this film based on the very favorable reviews that i read about it here by others br br they definitely saw something in this movie i didn't see that's for sure br br the movie starts off at a good pace and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting then it begins to get logged down and draggy not to mention completely unbelievable br br eventually you find yourself saying what he's going to do that too just how far is he going to go with this thing br br the plot begins with jeff goldblum's character john going into a deli to purchase a bottle of wine there is a robbery and a new store clerk auggie rose gets killed during the robbery br br john gets in the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy this seems a little much but wait there's more br br john becomes totally obsessed with auggie rose br br for reasons that never make any kind of logical sense john who has a very good life a beautiful loving girlfriend a secure well paying job nice house nice car expensive suits decides he wants to be a loser like auggie rose was and experience life in a low paying job living in a dump with a dippy girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people br br why this dim witted half baked film got favorable reviews i'll never know sure goldblum does a good acting job he always does and his looks have improved with age but unless you have a big infatuation with jeff goldblum and have to see every film he's in i wouldn't recommend this turkey it's approximately two hours of your life you're not going to get back and believe me you'll have nothing to be thankful about when those two hours are over other than being grateful you're not still sitting there watching this film br br
<START> i am the parent of a special needs child and i enjoyed the the movie very much it was loving warm and fun i learned a long time ago to see the humor in things i especially thought it was sweet how all the other characters worried about frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother died i attended a focus screening of the film with other parents and siblings of special needs children before the film was edited everyone enjoyed the film and it actually inspired wonderful discussions we talked about how our kids make us laugh and we also talked about how we worry about them the screenwriter talked about how she work with autistic children and other special needs children as a volunteer for several years she based the character on a real person our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has gotten us through some very stressful times i give the movie two thumbs up
<START> i began riding horses fairly recently and as anyone who has ever ridden should know i fell in love with horses and their world i rented spirit on a whim just trying to pack my life full of as much horse related material as i could and i was surprised by the results br br what i expected was a feel good disneyesque movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes br br what i got was an amazing film filled with beautiful scenery and animation and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm one's heart br br spirit is a wild mustang in the old west whose entire world is brought crumbling down around him when he discovers the humans slowly taking over his homeland the story unfolds with a wide array of characters some human some animals all are well written and most are pleasant to watch on screen br br i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story and who has an appreciation for history and animals br br one thing i forgot to mention but that i feel is important is that the animals in this film do not talk this was a really nice vacation from the lady and the tramp animated movies that everyone today is used to
<START> i bought this movie exciting a gloriously gratuitous over the top entertaining bloodbath i got none of them this film fails on practically every level not in the least frightening or funny it is simply terrible film making and never provides the audience with anything worth seeing what is so bad about it is that far from being as raw violent and brutal as it had promised to be there is very little violence at all virtually no blood shed and no excitement whatsoever acting direction and dialogue is absolutely unbearable honestly it is truly laughable i could hardly sit through this total garbage once i certainly will never want to watch it again don't waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this it is truly possibly the worst film ever made if i could give it minus stars i would
<START> i'm not great at writing reviews so i'll just spout my opinions br br i loved this series at first the adventure the action the comedy the drama i thought it was all brilliant anderson tapping shanks judge davis i loved them all davis it seemed was the fifth most important person in the cast not a big deal but when his character general hammond left at the end of the seventh season and anderson's character colonel o'neill moved from the field to the office the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff i don't know whether it's because hammond was more important that i realized or what but for some reason after the seventh season the series turned to br br the first seven seasons though were awesome the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it but it turned out to be even if this wasn't the original intention a brilliant setup to the series i recommend that you watch the movie first then watch the first season of the tv series then watch the movie again you'll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around believe me and then watch the rest of the tv series br br the last three seasons of the series aren't nearly as good as the first seven but that doesn't mean they aren't good it just means they're a letdown if you've gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons br br after you have finished this series be sure to watch the spin off series stargate atlantis it is a worthy successor to this brilliant series br br edit on 7 18 08 i just found out that don s davis died a few weeks ago it is a great loss
<START> as a massive fan of fantasy in general and of the works of neil gaiman in particular i've been looking forward to this film so avidly so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that i can scarcely believe it's finally here and you know what i needn't have feared the film version is bl dy awesome different from the book but in a good way less whimsical more comical still deeply sweet and enchanting br br the special effects are absolutely spot on and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive br br proper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing and the casting in the main is a triumph with the ghostly princes whose roll call read almost as a who's who of currently cool british comedy rupert everett david walliams of little britain fame two of the blokes from green wing etc stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films' funniest moments which exist in abundance br br in fact the one minor criticism i have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little ott subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story ricky gervais' cameo for example was far too much just ricky gervais doing his usual david brent from the office comedy persona for my liking and in my opinion created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story though in fairness from memory i believe the ferdy character in the original book was pretty ricky gervais esquire when i think back on it br br but this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance charlie cox as the protagonist tristan captures the correct mixture of naivety subtle comedy and self realisation required for a story like this where a humble young boy embarks on life changing quest claire danes as yvaine is beautiful feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal a perfect interpretation of her stellar role robert de niro in the cameo every reviewer is talking about is indeed deserving of praise rollicking good fun looks like he's having a ball too and michelle pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch lamia my favourite performance of the film overall if you enjoyed her deliciously b tchy performance in the recent hairspray then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this too br br so to round off this review you will laugh for sure you will smile and you may even cry stardust is a beautiful heart warming fairytale for all the family with a heart of gold and more sass 'n smarts than is immediately apparent one of my all time favourite films is the absolutely fantastic princess bride and stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory and just as the princess bride remains fresh smart and funny twenty years after its initial release i believe that the delicious tongue in cheek sweetness of stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions or equivalent future device for many years to come
<START> i may very well be one of the few who really stuck to this film i also saw this movie when it came out and i agree with the last post that up the acedemy was way ahead of its' time the humor in the film itself is pure mad magazine i don't see why mad stand behind this feature it was also one of the few films of the early 80's to have a killer accompanying soundtrack with the punk and new wave bands that were emerging from l a at the time i own the soundtrack and i play it constantly to this day what can i say there are definitely worst movies out there i don't consider porky's to be as funny as up the academy there are some really good laughs throughout the film and the jokes fall on either stereotypes or getting laid hey nobody said this was going to be the maltese falcon
<START> yeah unfortunately i came across the dvd of this and found that it was incredibly awful br br first of all the characters suck i mean come on if some dork in an orange hat who calls himself 'orange sherbert' is the best creative idea these guys could come up for a character then they should definitely not be in the film making scene poor costumes bad interviews and basically there is not one wrestler on this whole disc with any shred of charisma br br the wrestling in splatter rampage wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline they make sure to giggle together all the while too making the experience seem more like a toddler's playtime than a wrestling deathmatch br br basically splatter rampage wrestling is a pretty lackluster backyard wrestling clone only instead of blood weapons mayhem and wrestling we get a trampoline giggling kids terrible audio and some guy called orange sherbert br br wrestling fan or not avoid this dvd it's awful
<START> first off i'd like to say that if i had to honestly rate this movie from a 1 to a 10 then i'd give it a 4 it's not that i'm a tough critic it's just that this movie is that bad everything from the story to the directing to the editing is awful the story is not even halfway decent to begin with you can't expect much since it is based on a video game something i was not aware of going into the movie but the directing and editing made it even worse the movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones some like a quick sex scene in the middle don't even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters don't show any feelings toward each other you could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you'd still be disappointed honestly if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money and if you don't pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life so do yourself a favor and don't watch it
