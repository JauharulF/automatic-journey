<START> well the story is a little hard to follow the first time but that's only because of all the bare breasted '70s painted up vampire witches dancing to the bongo drums this of course interrupted by a few vampiric orgies and there are some very interesting candles and uses for them and for girl on girl action vampiric or not this movie just rocks
<START> hotel du nord is a gripping drama of guilt in which marcel carne portrayed an entertaining tale of ill fated love which also functions as a revolt against the cruel world the film is based entirely on a pair of hapless lovers pierre and renee were mistaken when they believed that suicide would put an end to their misery hotel du nord has its own inimitable charm as its inhabitants have become an essential part of the establishment there is an element of togetherness as everyone flocks to hotel du nord to eat chat etc marcel carne has remained true to the spirit of the films produced in 30s and 40s as hotel du nord has a certain kind of nostalgic feel carne while recreating the life of parisian roads was able to create a sort of nostalgia for black and white giving a unique genre of poetic realism to his oeuvre hotel du nord can be termed as a quintessence of cinematographic populism the 14th july ball scene on the banks of saint martin canal remains a magnificent sequence the film's immense popularity can be judged from the fact that hotel du nord has been declared as a national monument
<START> this effort is based on the true story of jim morris a high school science teacher baseball coach who is inspired by his players to try out for the pros and fulfill his life long dream of playing in the majors dennis quaid no stranger to sports films plays morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job of recreating the real world events that led to morris brief stint as a relief pitcher for the woefull tampa bay devil rays the first half of the film dealing with his rag tag bunch of high school baseball players all of whom look way too old to actualy be in high school is less effective and probably a bit too long overall the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without however it is still a fairly involving movie with an inspirational theme that proves once again that baseball is the national pastime for a reason grade b
<START> having heard so much about the 1990s cracker series without seeing any of them i looked forward to this eagerly surely the combination of jimmie mcgovern and robbie coltrane could not go wrong how wrong i was br br the polemics backed by frequent repetitive and violent flashbacks were overpowering the production tried to be super modern but the flashing boxes and even the childish font irritated robbie coltrane sleep walked through the two hours coming up with unexplained and unlikely insights and the police were portrayed as one dimensional bumbling idiots as a result the tension never built up and the next to final scene no details for fear of spoilers was as laughably bad a piece of tv drama as i have seen for a long time br br no i don't want to see any more of these but i will go back to the dvds of the 1990s series to see if they match their reputation
<START> the eight jean rollin film i have watched is also possibly the weirdest the intriguing plot such as it is seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along a would be female vampire scantily clad as promised by the title is held in captivity inside a remote chÃ¢teau and emerges only to 'feast' on the blood of willing victims who are apparently members of a suicide club as if unsure where all of this would lead him the writer director ultimately has the human villain Â actually the blank faced hero's kinky father Â ludicrously revealed as a mutant from the future the languorous pace and dream like atmosphere the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl are of course typical of both the film maker ditto the seashore setting at the anti climax and the euro cult style as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display personally the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor bernard musson who appeared in six latter day luis bunuel films crop up bemusedly through it from time to time
<START> this was eddie robinson's 101st film and his last and he died of cancer nine days after shooting was complete all of which makes his key scene in the movie all the more poignant br br although some of the hair and clothing styles are a bit dated also note the video game shown in the film but the subject of the film is pretty much timeless heston said he had wanted to make the film for some time because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation br br several things make this film a classic the story is solid br br the acting is top notch especially the interplay between heston and robinson with nice performances also by cotten and peters br br the music is absolutely perfect the medley of beethoven grieg and tchaikovsky combined with the pastoral visual elements make for some truly moving scenes this was the icing on the cake for the film br br and the theme or the point of the film is a significant one yes it's a film about overpopulation but on a more important note it's a cautionary tale about what can go wrong with man's stewardship of earth it's in the subtext that you find the real message of the film pay attention to what sol says about the old days of the past which is our present and note how thorn is incapable of comprehending what sol is saying br br this film is one of my top sci fi films of all time
<START> i was really looking forward to watching this being that i love danny dyer and i think gillian anderson is a gifted actress the beginning was interesting i liked the relationship between the two stars it then quickly jumps to the main plot which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and dyer gets beaten extremely bad while anderson gets raped they then decide to go for some revenge sounds good right well it's not the story gets boring and side tracked and certain things get really weird i won't give out any details but things happen that i for one have no desire to see i like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt and i really wanted to like this one it just didn't work out i give it a 3 out of 10 mainly for the acting
<START> this is the greatest film i saw in 2002 whereas i'm used to mainstream movies it is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films from the technical info the chosen directors i feared it would have an anti american basis but it's a kind of 11 times personal tribute br br the weakest point comes from y chahine he does not manage to swallow his pride and considers this event as a well merited punishment it is really the weakest part of the movie but this testifies of a real freedom of speech for the whole piece the weirdest comes from the mexican nearly conceptual art film i am still not sure what a gonzalez inarritu meant the 9 others are perfect k loach s penn s makhmalbaf or nearly perfect c lelouch and made me either smile or cry or even left me stunned i still don't know if s imamura's fable is really related or not to the september 11th catastrophe but it is so pretty that its finale place deeply 'makes it'
<START> very bad but watchable science fiction film that suffers from abominable special effects poor acting and a ridiculous story the film opens with a spaceship returning from exploration on mars with a woman and a man with green slime on his arm she through some hokey plot contrivances begins to tell what happened on this fateful trip as almost all the tapes seemed to be magnetically wiped off four astronauts take on this journey a military type played by gerald mohr a poor man's humphrey bogart who enjoys saying the word irish and has the acting savvy of a codfish then there is naura hayden a beautiful redhead and only female crew member on flight with three men wearing the most formfitting suits possible to accentuate all her curves next les tremaine a wonderful character actor from cheap sci fi films like this as the egghead and last jack kruschen as sammy the guy from brooklyn with jokes and doesn't seem too bright although chosen for his expertise in electronics none of these performers are really any good and all of them say their dialog with little conviction watch tremaine as he utters that scientific nonsense really the best out of the four is kruschen and that really says a lot about this film but bad acting aside the movie just falls apart when they land on mars via flashback the angry red planet had a real cheap budget because mars is really the american southwest with a heavy red tint over it when the story calls for something that might look martian there are drawings placed with a heavy red tint over them you can tell they are drawings the monsters are perhaps even worse as we get a bat rat spider with a size upwards of 40 feet that looks like some kids got together piecing dead animals together the other significant creature is a giant amoeba with an oscillating eye whew these are bad there is a nice drawing of a martian city but there just was not enough of this in the film despite all these big problems the angry red planet is a fun bad film it is really fascinating to see how far we have come as a civilization most of the stuff they used in the movie is so outdated one guy is using an electric razor with a cord and i thought they can get to mars but they are still using cords director ib melchior gives an interesting look to much of the film even with the budgetary constraints but the story by him and sid pink doesn't fly and how bout that ending with the music and the psychedelic colors groovy man
<START> following the brilliant goyÃ´kiba aka hanzo the razor sword of justice 1972 and its excellent and even sleazier sequel goyÃ´kiba kamisori hanzÃ´ jigoku zeme aka razor 2 the snare 1973 this goyÃ´kiba oni no hanzÃ´ yawahada koban aka razor 3 who's got the gold is the third and sadly final installment to the awesome saga about the incorruptible samurai constable hanzo 'the razor' ittami brilliantly played by the great shintarÃ´ katsu who fights corruption with his fighting expertise as well as his enormous sexual powers as a big fan of 70s exploitation cinema made in nippon sword of justice became an instant favorite of mine and i was therefore more than eager to find the sequels and full of anticipation when i finally stumbled over them recently while this third hanzo film is just not quite as brilliant as its predecessors it is definitely another great piece of cult cinema that no lover of japanese exploitation cinema can afford to miss who's got the gold is a bit tamer than the two foregoing hanzo films but it is just as brilliantly comical and crudely humorous and immediately starts out fabulously odd the film begins when hanzo's two assistants see a female ghost when fishing having always wanted to sleep with a ghost hanzo insists that his assistants lead him to the site of the occurrence if that is not a promising beginning for an awesome film experience i don't know what is shintaro katsu one of my personal favorite actors is once again brilliant in the role of hanzo a role that seems to have been written specifically for him katsu is hanzo the obstinate and fearless constable who hates corruption and deliberately insults his superiors and whose unique interrogation techniques include raping female suspects the interrogated women than immediately fall for him due to his sexual powers and enormous penis which he trains in a rather grotesque routine ritual i will not give away more about the plot in who's got the gold but i can assure that it is as cool as it sounds the supporting performances are also very good and as in the predecessors there are plenty of hilariously eccentric characters this is sadly the last film in the awesomely sleazy 'hanzo' series if they had made 20 sequels more i would have happily watched them all the entire hanzo series is brilliant and while this third part is a bit inferior compared to its predecessors it is definitely a must see for all lovers of cult cinema oh how i wish they had made more sequels
<START> john hughes wrote a lot of great comedies in the '80s european vacation is not one of them the follow up to hughes' first big hit vacation 1983 is about as predictable unfunny and annoying as they come no matter how much you love the dumb but romantic clark and ellen griswold chase and d'angelo br br i greatly enjoyed vacation as well as the third film 1989's christmas vacation but the griswold's trip to europe is bland and forced perhaps because this was hughes' first attempt at a sequel that he didn't get it but it's really dumbfounding how uninspired and devoid of a story european vacation is there is no through story the griswolds win a game show for being greedy little pigs and go on a tour of europe through england france germany and italy even the screwball physical humor that is the trademark of the first loses all effect because you see it coming which is part director amy heckerling's fault the fast times at ridgemont high director sets everything up too predictably br br maybe it was hughes taking a cheap shot because he was put up to the sequel european vacation takes great pride in insulting americans recall the greedy little pig game show they win especially tourists represented by the cornball griswold family it also pats itself on the back implicitly saying oh us griswolds we're always getting into something because our dad is an idiot then in nearly comic fashion it ends with a tribute to america and how grateful the griswolds are to return to such a better country if hughes was going for satire and meant to do it in the form of a bad movie well maybe i should award this 8 10 stars br br it's not just the unfunniness but european vacation boasts the two worst actors to play kids rusty and audrey jason lively and dana hill they're both annoying and obnoxious with the unattractive and loud mouthed audrey blubbering about the boyfriend she's left behind nearly the entire film hughes even goes as far as to have her comment about missing him right as she observes a giant bratwurst quite tasteful speaking of breasts are flashed in two different scenes for no good reason unless it was to comment on americans' love of gratuitous nipples in their comedies br br i will give the film one of its two stars thanks to eric idle of the monty python crew whose cameo at a few different points in the film where he recites lines directly from holy grail is about the funniest part if hughes intended for us to find one of the film's only non american actors as the only funny part then another tip of the hat to him for ripping open the underbelly of hollywood comedy in the '80s still would it have hurt for him to do that while making it entertaining
<START> it's a good thing i didn't watch this while i was pregnant i definitely would have cried my eyes out and or vomit it was kind of gruesome mainly disturbing i personally thought the baby was adorable in its own twisted little way however as a mom i cringed when beth stabbed herself in the stomach and when virgina aborted the child during her 3rd trimester with rusty utensils no less also as an animal lover i almost cried when she scratched the cat to a bloody pulp however as creepy and sinister as the baby was i was rooting for it to live and as twisted as the movie was i am extremely intrigued to see the sequel
<START> surprisingly well done for an independent film an insomniac's nightmare paints a startling picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia wonderfully well written and directed it creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer is taken through one night in the life of an insomniac br br starring dominic monaghan as jack we get to see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night drag on the narration is almost hypnotizing and from the opening lines it is impossible to turn away fascinating and slightly disturbing it shows how someone copes with a lack of sleep balancing on the brink between sanity and madness br br with twists and turns around every corner an insomniac's nightmare is provocative and engaging it comes very highly recommended
<START> does anyone think that this show actually helps some people or does it only anger the people who watch it when i am flipping through the channels and come upon this show i half to watch out of morbid curiosity i understand that pat roberson is not all together what i do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listening to what he has to say pat roberson is of little consequence he is an old man who thinks in an old way fear of damnation no longer has the same affects as it once did thank god now if someone will please answer my question i will be dodging lightning bolts for the rest of eternity
<START> so the wife and i just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off for the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie there was just very little excitement the acting was atrocious to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes the church lady for example the dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like the ring rather then get the police involved which i'm sure those earplugs she found would have dna all over them she instead devises a horrible plan to 'get' the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister i call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too which the movie then fades to black bad dialog bad acting bad ending
<START> i have seen every episode of this spin off i thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is grey's anatomy thus i have continued to watch i'm afraid the second season lacks the charm the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it's predecessor grey's anatomy the relationships seem contrived and the acting is so so the writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in ga there are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived unfortunately pp is not so i loved kate walsh's presence in ga i'm afraid kate walsh's life in la is simply not interesting
<START> i can watch b b c and feel all the emotions i felt when i first saw it at aged 18 well maybe all but one certainly miss k novak has lost none of her silky allure in nearly half a century she was a thinking youth's diana dors all those thinking youths now collecting their pensions can briefly regain the heart clutching collar tightening blood pulsing ardour they felt when she gazed directly into their eyes back in the days when they were being told that they had never had it so good now huddled up against the cold and fearful of being mugged by a hoodie they scuttle home as fast as their arthritic knees can carry them from the video shop relatively happy in the certain knowledge that within the triple locked comparative safety of their fourth floor tower block flat they can regain just a small fragment of their lost youth and perhaps reflect that love truly is eternal this movie is miss novak's golden moment she seized it avidly and gave a performance of awesome voluptuousness combined with a hypnotic awareness of her own sex appeal and despite all this she convinces us that her character possesses a strange and beguiling innocence she completely dominates the amiable mr j stewart who seems resigned to handing her the movie misses e lanchester and h gingold offer comic relief along with mr e kovacs whose peculiar talents are strictly proscribed mr j lemmon plays miss novak's brother he is a beatnik a species that disappeared as soon as it realised that its existence was being acknowledged by the mainstream some of the more hardcore beats reinvented themselves as hippies a few years later certainly they had become figures of fun by 1958 and mr lemmon does not appear overly concerned with restraint in portraying one but all else is mere frippery miss novak bathed in a particularly beautiful spectrum of technicolor is the sole raison d'etre for bell book and candle it survives its reputation enhanced as the ultimate showcase for one of hollywood's most beautiful women loved by moviegoers ignored by critics miss novak will continue to captivate with that enigmatic smile all the time thinking old men have the strength to push the play buttons on their dvds one day probably after we are all gone she will be discovered by a new generation who will belatedly realise that it is quite possible for a woman to be fully dressed and sexually attractive at the same time
<START> the first episode of this new show was on today and it was horrible not only did shaggy have a squeaky new voice that made listening to his lines torture but it's so far away from the original concept and animation style that it's barely recognizable as a 'scooby doo' show br br even back in the dark days when fred and velma were gone and scooby's nephew scrappy was there the team still solved mysteries this new show instead features shaggy and scooby battling a james bond type super villain and his henchmen while living in a mansion there's not even a van called 'the mystery machine' and the teaser for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did not put my mind at ease how can anyone take scooby doo and make this br br the show earns two point for two scenes featuring the whole scooby doo gang all of whom speak with the correct voices except shaggy and even then i'm being far too generous
<START> a movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story the luzhin defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty depth and character br br it gives john turturro what is probably his finest role to date thank goodness they didn't give it to ralph fiennes who would have murdered it similarly emily watson shows the wealth of her experience from her outstanding background on the stage to reach the tortured chess master turturro her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman's love watson does not portray beauty pageant sexuality but she brings to her parts a self awareness that is alluring br br in a chance meeting between natalia watson and luzhin she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing a specially crafted piece that we realize later in the film has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations later as their love affair develops she subtly likens dancing to chess luzhin has learnt to dance but never with a partner she encourages him to lead her with bold brilliant moves and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best and also realize himself as her lover br br this is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment emotionally and intellectually or so we are led to believe certainly within the time frame natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother br br the italian sets are stunning the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent movie goer yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit and most deservedly so chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess player that the characters existed although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting
<START> mild spoilers br br in the near future arnold stars as ben richards a wrongly convicted man coerced into playing 'the running man' a deadly tv game show where people have to keep moving to try and escape brutal deaths at the hands of the 'stalkers' of course people are expected to die eventually and its up to arnold to prove the system wrong br br i haven't read the stephen king book but this is a great film regardless one of arnold's best he does what he does best in the action man role delivering death with unforgettable one liners classics are probably the 'he was a real pain in the neck' after strangling a guy with barb wire and 'he had to split ' referring to whereabouts he just chain sawed someone vertically dawson is perfectly irritating as the tv presenter and all the 'stalkers' are suitably camp the action is violent but its an action film that's the point the film is fast paced and at 90 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome br br with starsky and hutch's paul michael glaser at the helm and made in the wake of the success of the terminator previously this film was probably seen as just another mindless action vehicle for arnold and very far fetched but today anyone who watches a lot of tv could see how the film is getting closer to reality i wouldn't be surprised if i turn on the tv in the 'near future' and see a show not to far from this br br on that depressing note i must however recommend 'the running man' to anyone who likes the 80s arnold ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action film 9 5 10
