<START> this is one of the best films i have seen in years i am not a gwyneth paltrow fan but she is excellent as emma woodhouse alan cumming is superb as reverand elton and emma thompson's sister sophie is hysterical as miss bates and check out the gorgeous jeremy northam as mr knightley what a gentleman whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen emma i think that is what separates it from so many others it's classy br br if you're looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family or looking for a romance for yourself look no further emma is that movie with a beautiful setting wonderful costumes and an outstanding cast have i mentioned the gorgeous jeremy northam emma is a perfect ten
<START> heres a fun fact i was the baby in the movie the one in the crib i am 19 years old now my parents took me to try out for the part we lived in texas at the time i think i only made like 80 bucks for it but i wasn't in it very long my parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry i was all mixed up strange and funny fact i suppose and no i am not a child actress i am livin' in san antonio workin' at a walgreens i graduated here in texas but i lived in maryland most my life this movie is a great movie though good concept i have seen it several times in my short 19 years
<START> this was an incredibly stupid movie it was possibly the worst movie i've ever had the displeasure of sitting through i cannot fathom how it ranks a rating of 5 or 6
<START> no this is not no alice fairy tale my friends this wonderland' fable is based on the true story of the gruesome bloody wonderland murders that occurred back in 80's california at the center of this bloodbath was no other than johnny wad' himself yes john holmes daddy ding dong used other shotguns than his infamous 13 inch milk machine besides being a legendary adult film actor holmes was as also a hardcore drug addict who befriended various hollywood junkies val kilmer was occasionally majestic as holmes but for once this holmes character did not milk it through completely the film possesses a who's who' of supporting players josh lucas dylan mcdermott as hollywood riffraffs kate bosworth lisa kudrow as the women in holmes life and eric bogosian as a menacing tinsletown entrepreneur these characters do play integral parts directly or indirectly in the wonderland' murders out of this support group it was josh lucas who was the most fierce impressive as the ardent ron launius lucas is gradually escalating into a major hollywood player with such charismatic turns in a beautiful mind' sweet home alabama' director james cox sometime proved to be a bit of a coxsucker by displaying a vast amount of overextended scenes just like holmes' famous organ holmes was eventually acquitted of the wonderland' murders he died of complications from the aids virus wonderland' will keep you wondering what really happened that bloody night and if holmes really laid out his weapon oops wrong holmes movie ok that is enough before i get penislized' i mean penalized bye holmies average
<START> this was a highly original decent movie and a brave move for all those involved i don't care if it's not the most well put together movie of all time the fact that it has eddie murphy doing something non formulaic and that i don't know what will happen next makes it a favorite of mine i wish more movies were as imaginative as this one rather than the same old formula for entertainment
<START> i couldn't believe how lame pointless this was basically there is nothing to laugh at in the movie hardly any scenes to get you interested in the rest of the movie this movie pulled in some huge stars but they were all wasted in my opinion i think keanu reeves must've taken some acting lessons a fews years after this movie before he stared in the matrix uma thurman looked very simple humble luckily i got this movie for a very low price because its certainly not a movie to remember for any good reasons i won't write anything about the story of the movie but as you should know that she is meant to be the most famous hitchhiker across america because of her huge thumb i would give this movie a 2 10 before i watched this movie i was wondering why this movie has only got a 4 0 10 now i know why a very disappointing movie don't buy it even if you see it for under 5
<START> i ended up watching the tenants with my close friends who rented the movie solely based on snoop dogg's appearance a passionate fetish of theirs on the cover understandably i did not expect much i thought the movie would include the typical array of snoop dogg related behavior and imagery often seen in clichÃ© rap videos however my generalization was for the most part wrong unfortunately this didn't make the movie any better br br most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama whereas i would describe it as a dark seriously drawn out boring drama flick the film tells a story of two struggling writers dylan mcdermott and snoop dogg who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces their polar opposite lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship this friendship moves throughout the entire movie like a wild roller coaster most of which is contributed by snoop's character reminiscent of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder and although the movie is a drama the acting which has a morbid and serious tone from snoop and company was more comical than anything else br br i wouldn't recommend this movie for those who are attention impaired because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that there are some mediocre conflicts but even they are mostly bogged down with more dialogue the end however jumped at me with a sudden surprise it was a little bit twisted somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end while watching the ending credits i couldn't help but picture the director thinking oh god how the hell do i end this snoozer by the way the director laid out carefully planted hints and subtleties leading to the climax all of which are more visible than waldo in a crowded street of midgets wearing nothing but black sweaters
<START> i always tell people that enchanted april is an adult movie with no cussing no sex and no violence one might think of it as the ultimate chick flick but i bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who love it too don't invite the kids though this movie is very low key br br seeing enchanted april is a very healing experience the sound track and gorgeous scenery along with the ladies' gentle manners bring to mind the peace and beauty of a pre raphaelite painting br br lest anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie i will paraphrase a line i heard once on saturday night live and say that my two favorite movies are the deer hunter and enchanted april
<START> i notice the dvd version seems to have missing scenes or lines between the posting of the frf and the launch br br they are to prove they can win the right to sit in the frf other than the green team br br another scene is like during their failure at the simulation kevin gets joaquin to clam down br br i think the vhs edition other than the abc one might have all the missing stuff br br otherwise i like to know which dvd release has the missing stuff br br the dvd i have watched feels edited for television
<START> this movie was god awful from conception to execution the us needs to set up a star wars site in this remote country this is their premise the way to gain access the us concludes is to win an obstacle course like cross country race where the winner can ask anything of the leader and who better to win this race known as the game than a gymnast of course a gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission and don't forget that his father was an operative lucky for our hero there happen to be gymnastic equipment in fortunate spots like the stone pommel horse in the middle of a square for no reason amidst crazy town perfect br br but above and beyond the horrible horibble premise is the awkward fumblings of the romantic scenes the obviously highly depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be holding a flag to point out the race path and the worst climax ever after winning the race our hero puts forth the wishes of the us government and lo and behold all the effort was worth it because the us gets its star wars site huzzah this is your triumphant ending wow br br but still being such a bad movie it can be great fun to watch the cover alone depicting ninjas with machine guns was enough to get me to rent this film br br but if i were ever to meet kurt thomas the gymnast star in real life i would probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 1 2 twists in the layout position
<START> a movie best summed up by the scene where a victim simulates disembowelment by pulling some poor animal's intestines out from under her t shirt too terrible for words
<START> a great 90's flick parker posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in manhattan that requires so much cash posey gives an amazing performance as a librarian and a night crawler this is a good light movie for saturday night before you go out the soundtrack rocks the outfits are out of this world the script is funny and the actors do a great job the redeeming value you can make it in this world if you try just find your niche i believe parker posey is the perfect actress for this kind of character young fabulous and broke you must look up the movie clockwatchers if you watch party girl you are bound to have a good time enjoy
<START> i saw this film in winnipeg recently appropriate given the location used i first read lawrence's book back in the 70's and for me it's always been a very powerful picture of the trials of aging in our society it resonated when i was young and it resonates even more now when the film came out i was keen to see if the story could survive and was thoroughly impressed especially with ellen burstyn's performance she manages to give us a complete human being even though the character is generally cranky and judgmental someone that you wouldn't want to live with it's great to be able to see favourite characters come to life so authentically
<START> when i saw the film for the first time in the early 1970s i was in awe of this film visually it was stunning and the events on campuses in europe and usa made you relate with what antonioni was trying to say so well visually in the final 15 minutes of the movie blowing up in your mind the tyrannical establishments and big business interests the repeated blowing up of the beautiful house in the middle of a desert the lead female character enjoying the natural stream of cold water painting a plane in psychedelic designs even the staid british airways did it a few years ago are some of the images that were copied by advertising personnel all over the world for decades even pink floyd increased their fan following after the film was released br br you see this film some 30 years later and you begin to wonder why the same film has lost its appeal today anti establishment films have more substance facts documentation fine performances and superb screenplays antonioni seems to be out of date a flawed genius even viewing antonioni's blow up today gives you the similar feeling that he is passe br br zabriski point has to be evaluated for what it was when it was released it was a great film if you were to see it on a wide panavision screen as opposed to the dwarfed tv screens the visual and aural mick jagger kieth richards pink floyd et al allure of the film still remains the lead pair were not great actors but they were cute and natural one of them mark frechette died in prison in usa extending the reality of the non conformist values he personified in the film br br today antonioni seems out of sync but watch carefully and you will appreciate the muted sounds of the regular actors rod taylor g d spradling the ladies at the swimming pool the cops at the air strip the real sounds in contrast are from the non conformists antonioni was relevant 30 years ago but his grasp of the medium cannot be questioned even today he knew what he was doing
<START> as a premise this backwoods version of the dead calm storyline had promise br br however director eric red's inability to render a convincing hurricane leads to a deluge of continuity and lighting errors br br ultimately the viewer is more spellbound by the bizarre weather effects than the intended storyline intermittent spates of ham fisted over direction are similarly distracting br br charles dance doing an 'inbred backwoods hardass' schtick does his best to save the movie but ultimately undertow squeals like a pig and has more ham to boot
<START> first be warned that i saw this movie on tv and with dubbed english which may have entirely spoiled the atmosphere however i'll rate what i saw and hope that will steer people away from that version i found this movie excruciatingly dull all the movie's atmosphere is lost with dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie i'm sorry but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy i didn't see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie maybe i missed something but i have to tell it like i see it i rated it a 1 what can i say u s oriented tastes maybe
<START> this picture was banned from american movies houses in the 1930 because of nudity by hedy lamarr eva hermann which caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the 1930's but not so much for the male population this story concerns a young woman named eva hermann who gets married to an older man and is carried over the threshold on the wedding night and the husband never consummates the marriage and worries about all kinds of very petty things like his shoes and killing bugs eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation on a hot summer day eva takes a ride on her horse and decides to go for a swim naked in a lake in the woods her horse runs off and she runs after him and is observed by a young man who finds her clothes and returns them to eva these two people become very acquainted and there is a romance that starts to bloom there are many more interesting problems that arise as you view this film to its very end enjoy a great classic film which was a shocker film in 1933 enjoy
<START> i saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the makings of a family joke if the ranking had a zero this movie would get it the dinosaurs were awful the storyline was ridiculous the acting really doesn't qualify to be called acting the only reason i even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family still talks about how bad it really was
<START> i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes but if you liked princess bride and forest gump you would like this movie you can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than nepolean dynamite just my opinion i'm sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french so this film isn't for a world audience and while i am not a trained film critic i know what i like i couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie
<START> i never was an avid viewer of crocodile hunter but did occasionally see an episode or a bit of an episode and when the news spread about steve irwin's death from a stingray attack in 2006 it certainly caught my attention this movie with steve and his wife terri playing themselves but in a fictional story was released in 2002 but i didn't hear of it until several years later and even after that it took me a while to get around to seeing it well now i have seen it and after looking here first more than once and seeing its rating i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be though it could have been a bit better apparently it's supposed to be a comedy so a major problem with it is that it isn't very funny at all br br a u s satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in australia where it is swallowed by a crocodile while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy brozzie drewitt and are unaware of what's inside it two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the beacon the agents are assisted by jo buckley and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them on steve and terri's mission they face other types of dangerous wildlife not just the crocodile and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it when steve sees the cia agents after them he mistakes them for poachers br br not only did i not laugh once while watching this film the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents apart from that i don't think i found anything even mildly amusing it's also a bit of an incoherent mess switching back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquarters and it seems like clips from crocodile hunter and clips from an action thriller or something like that put together for some reason also added to that mix are the ranch scenes which also seem to be from somewhere else and as funny as brozzie drewitt played by magda szubanski is supposed to be she's not at one point we see her farting so we have a fart joke a major clichÃ© in modern comedy are they so hard to resist i also found the typical crocodile hunter scenes with steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers to be tedious but i guess the fact that i was never a devout fan of the show didn't help br br steve irwin was admired by many as a conservationist and is sadly missed by them while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him no matter which side you're on the crocodile hunter collision course is not a well crafted movie i'm sure it does help if you're a big steve irwin fan but even if you are there's no guarantee that you would like this movie as some fans clearly haven't been impressed in fact it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have so maybe it won't help like i said there's no guarantee i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show this movie was unnecessary the attempt to combine what is usually seen in crocodile hunter with a fictional story unfortunately failed and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes
