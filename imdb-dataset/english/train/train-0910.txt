<START> if you are looking for eye candy you may enjoy sky captain sky captain is just a video game injected with live performers the visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie now saying that the visuals are the only thing good in sky captain br br after ten minutes i knew i was watching one of the worse movies of all time i was hoping this movie would get better but it never achieved any degree of interest after thirty minutes the urge to walk out kept growing and growing now i own over 2000 movies and have seen probably five times that number yet this is only the second movie i felt like walking out of my entire life br br acting there is none the three main performers are pitiful jude law also in the other movie i wanted to walk out on is just awful in the title role i would rather sit through ben affleck in gigli than watch law again br br paltrow tries so hard to be campy that it backfires in her face the last article i had read said that paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting after this performance i would applaud that decision br br story soap operas are better written the story behind sky captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progresses br br directing none everything was put into the special effects that story acting and directing suffer greatly even the phantom menace had better acting and that is not saying a great deal br br i would have to give this movie a 0 out of 10 avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release
<START> i saw this movie with some indian friends on christmas day the quick summary of this movie is must avoid jp dutta wrote directed produced and edited this movie and did none of these jobs well br br the movie tells the story of the attempt by pakistan in 1999 to capture part of the disputed region of kashmir from india supposedly based on fact you get a hint from this movie of the difficulty the indian army had in recapturing the area from the pakistani troops who occupied the high ground but instead of telling what must have been a compelling and heroic story all this movie does is make the indian military look laughable and stupid which i know is not true br br i watched this movie with an almost completely indian audience who were very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this movie but also found themselves laughing at scenes that weren't meant to be funny br br the script was absolutely abysmal it gave the impression that mr dutta knows nothing about how an army operates and was using bad war movies for reference the result is a script that is brainless and repetitive br br the acting from most of the principals was not stellar but considering the script they were given i find it hard to criticise them too much as for the supporting cast all i can say is that i hope they were amateurs br br the editing was also pretty bad it was pretty hard to follow what was going on for a lot of the time and music would abruptly end at scene changes br br good things the cinematography was pretty good although it was hurt a little by the fact that the movie didn't appear to be colour corrected the colour balance often varied significantly within scenes also the few songs that were in the movie were quite enjoyable for the first half a dozen or so verses at least unfortunately they went on a lot longer than they should have br br and the worst crime of all this mess is four hours long there is enough here that a good editor could almost squeeze a good 1 5 2 hour movie out of what was shot sadly a good editor was not working on this movie
<START> the bfg is one of roald dahl's most cherished books but in this animated adaptation the magic just isn't there this version remains pretty faithful to dahl's original story so one can't lay the blame on john hambley's script if anything the fault lies with the colourless animation the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice overs one would be right to expect this story to make for a happy vibrant fun filled movie instead the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first all the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a children's' classic br br young orphan sophie voice of amanda root lives in a none too friendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of mrs clonkers one evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street the figure realises it has been seen so it reaches in through the window and scoops sophie from her bed placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from giant country and fears that he will eat her but to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the bfg voice of david jason the bfg refuses to eat people instead restricting himself to foul tasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers however giant country is populated by numerous other giants who do feast every night as it happens on poor unsuspecting humans sophie and the bfg become great friends and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants together they go to the queen of england voice of angela thorne with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man eating giants the queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else br br jason voices the bfg quite well one of the few pluses in the film but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality the rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired with very little to bring the characters to life similarly the bfg is the only character that is imaginatively animated sophie lacks appeal and the giants are boringly designed and look almost indistinguishable from each other even the places are uninventive giant country especially comes up short being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons at 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences little of dahl's mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily one chapter in the book deals with the bfg's love of whizzpopping farting and is laugh out loud hilarious in the film the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling i came to the the bfg expecting lots of zest fun and enjoyment but what i got was pretty much the opposite this one is a failed misfire that simply doesn't match the calibre of the book in any department unfortunately therefore it must go down as one to skip
<START> the sentinel i was hoping would be a good film and boy i was right a great story first of all from a novel and i thought this was an original story but i guess it wasn't and it was a very smart story michael douglas in this film is very good and keither sutherland is too but however it is very hard to shrug him off his role as jack bauer in 24 but eventually you do and he is very different in the sentinel than he is in 24 also another person trying to shrug off their tv role but failed eva longeria she wasn't that good in the film and had a back seat in the entire thing after i saw the film i had constant dreams about the sentinel and couldn't sleep overall sentinel is a good film and i would recommend it
<START> one of the most appealing elements of a gilliam film is that the well concocted visuals the unsettling backdrops and the manically frustrated characters are evidence of the creator's involvement instead of most movies where the filmmaker is some director for hire that is paid to feature a star or two you can feel terry gilliam's presence through the experience 12 monkeys is evidence of gilliam's own vision and style as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake 12 monkeys is a variation on similar themes of gilliam's repertoire oppressive recessive societies the solitude of the protagonist the frustration associated with disbelief and parallel realms in this film gilliam does a fine job of blurring lines between the two realms using ambiguities to force the audience to believe rather than know this tendency for gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of art house pretentiousness the difference between gilliam and artsy posers is that gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning the two nearly identical bathing scenes of cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparisons which leave the audience unsettled his bald head is a mark of uniformity in the disease ridden future world yet makes him recognizable in the 1996 world the title itself is a mark of gilliam's creativity as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning to be fully understood all in all gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch yet also require thought and interpretation from the audience the film has immense re watch value since there are subtle details and hints that can be missed upon the first viewing definitely one of my favorites
<START> james stewart plays an fbi agent who began working with the agency before it was called the fbi and the story involves dealing with the ku klux klan the prohibition era gangsters world war ii german and japanese spies etc a continuously interesting picture covering 40 years of history far superior to any films being made these days br br of special interest to older viewers familiar with washington dc in a scene about 20 minutes into the movie where james stewart finds out from vera miles that she's expecting their first child the scene was filmed in herzog's seafood restaurant on the former washington waterfront the only movie in which this historic location appears shortly after taking office president kennedy decided that southwest washington a 99 black neighborhood was an eyesore and ought to be torn down by decree befitting his position of undisputed royalty the entire area including the popular waterfront restaurant district but excluding 3 historic churches was reduced to rubble black residents evicted from their homes relocated as best they could and without federal assistance likewise businesses were simply put out of business few re locating restaurant row was converted into a sidewalk and washington had no waterfront restaurants seafood stands boats etc for about 10 years as a lifetime resident the herzog restaurant scene was our 1 reason to see this fine movie again
<START> hearing such praise about this play i decided to watch it when i stumbled across it on cable i don't see how this elivates women and their struggles by focusing on the topic at hand i guess if you have an interest in stories about women's private parts and how it affects their lives then this is for you otherwise it's rather dull and boring if anything i found it a bit degrading br br i inquired with a female friend who also watched this and she thought it was horrible as well so it's not just a guy not getting it
<START> once again jet li brings his charismatic presence to the movie screen in the film black mask in this film li plays tsui an escapee from a super soldier program who seeks to regain the humanity that the program had taken away from him to do this tsui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life but fate demands that he clean up problems from his past before he can continue to seek peace other members of the super soldier program had escaped at the same time as tsui but they want to get even with the world rather than find inner peace thus tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former team mates from releasing information that could cost many innocent people their lives this film screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go the martial arts is amazing but because it uses wires it may not be appreciated as much as it deserves by american audiences if you like action movies that have an interesting story and demand good acting performances because they deal with psychological as well as physical conflicts then black mask is for you i am glad to see that some of jet li's movies are finally getting main stream release in the united states and look forward to seeing how the changes that that release will require things like dubbing and soundtrack will affect the film this is one of li's best films go out and see it on may 14 when it is released in america
<START> although dig was being hailed as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly fabricated the director has misled the audience into believing the brian jonestown massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post '98 and the rivalry between the dandy warhols and jonestown has been milked the truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film br br that said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art one of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene br br recommended mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands
<START> let's face it some lame kid who dies and has his soul transfered into a scarecrow das no gonna happen neva omfg this stupid loser kid who can't stand up for himself gets his ass handed to him by some drunk bastard screwing his mom right as he dies he looks up at the scarecrow and he let's his spirit go into the scarecrow the drunk guy covered up his death by making it seem suicidal and thought he had gotten away with it we later see he is tossed out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with the scarecrow they had a brief encounter which includes the drunk calling him a loser and the scarecrow rebounding with takes one to know one loser the scarecrow flips off the building calls him daddy o and then beheads the poor man we can see how this awesome movie unfolds from that he goes on to kill many people afterward he mainly kills the people who gave him a hard time in rl and goes off to kill some random ass people just for some laughs no laughing here he adds a punchline to every kill too every time he killed someone he would do some karate flips and finish it all off with one of his signature punchlines in the case of someone who was hard of hearing he would say here have an ear of corn then shove it up their ass or we can actually take an example from the movie he just got done killing a cop and was on his way to killing the only person who ever stood up for him her father the sheriff yelled to the madman to stop and he said hey stay awhile and threw a dagger threw his chest and stuck him onto some tree in the end of the movie he killed two guys and threw in the punchline gotta split and killed two guys by shoving a scythe into their heads wowzors this movie made me want to cream my pants so bad maybe next time this guy makes a movie it won't be gay
<START> i thought the film could be a bit more complex in a psychological sense perhaps but the action and voice acting were top notch the animation was heavy cg in many scenes but very good ones at that this is one of the batman returns forever type films which include romances and the conflicts of wayne and motives for dating 007 fans would love this and so would the females great theme song wayne was portrayed very well in this film and the penquin was back to his true form no mutant genes in him this time i liked the fact robin wasn't used too much tim drake was just a good computer nerd somewhat of an indigo child or mind of the future br br the supporting cast was made up of some soap opera stars decent talents and the characters were drawn to look like the voice actors too kelly ripa was hilarious in this film br br i rate this below phantasm return of the joker and batman vs dracula but liked the smarter script better than i enjoyed subzero 7 10
<START> i wish i could give this movie a zero or even lower because sadly that's what it deserves i honestly never walk out of a movie but this one was so dreadfully awful that i couldn't stand another minute of it please please please for the sake of mankind skip this movie if you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really delve into this isn't it br br it has unattractive unappealing leads choppy structure ridiculous dialog and it is absolutely unconvincing in every imaginable way on an absolutely basic level it fails to entertain everything about mango kiss is so stagey it is worse than any student film i have seen br br as if that weren't enough the entire movie relies on constant and i mean constant voice over narration the script writer may as well have written a novel because they insisted on telling everything instead of showing it we are just supposed to assume that lou and sassafras are the best of friends and have a special connection even though there is no character development to illustrate this also this film continues to introduce to new characters after the first five minutes and not in a natural way but in a freeze frame of the characters with their name written over the screen there is no introduction no development of any of the characters we don't really get to know any of them br br this is the most amateur movie i have ever seen br br i am a gay woman who watched this film with my roommate another gay woman and we both found this movie to be a depressing representation of queer cinema i am beginning to think that lesbian and gay movies are a lot like christian rock it doesn't matter how atrocious it is people will still flock to it and champion it no matter how poor the quality is please don't rent this instead let's encourage the production of quality gay and lesbian movies by renting but i'm a cheerleader or fire or heavenly creatures instead of swallowing whatever mindless tripe they aim at the gay community i e queer as folk
<START> first of all i am a butch straight white male but even with that handicap i love this movie it's about real people a real time and place and of course new york city in the 80's i had many gay friends growing up in new york in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them no matter what the consequences that's courageous you have to admire that this is a great film watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant african american or hispanic gay man in the new york of the eighties it's real life bottom line it's real life
<START> i had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie after all this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind and it was one of the first epic tales i read as a kid even before tolkien i must say that it was a huge disappointment they completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera the elements that were faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles it was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like achilles who has a strange combination of nearly matrix like powers utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem turn to fabio on the beach in the guise of pitt who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure hollywood has ever produced the actors were actually decent trying to make the best of a ridiculous script it was actually a waste of so much talent peter o'toole stole the show and orlando bloom and sean bean were pathetic compare it to lotr or gladiator and it doesn't even hold a candle to them plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege i wouldn't recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was at least they got that part right
<START> this movie no correction this thing this abysmal abomination from the burning pits of hell should have been killed before it even left the writer's head i could not possibly come up with enough adjectives to describe this movie but let's try anyway horrible bad nauseating tasteless crap vomit inducing gut wrenchingly bad hideous nasty putrid there just aren't enough words in the english language the plot involves a serial killer who becomes a snow man don't ask how not important the killer snowman runs about killing people how you may ask can a snowman kill someone in tasteless ways that make you want to remove your eyes if only so you don't have to endure that styrofoam snowman anymore in ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you do not have to endure his snow puns anymore don't watch this movie destroy it on sight for the sake of your very soul don't watch it
<START> antonioni's movies have aged not well what always surprised me about them is that besides an unquestionable plastic beauty there is a dull and didactic psychology of the characters and situations remember for instance the conversations between mastroianni and the wicked capitalistic that wants sing up him in la notte or monica vitti laughing at the peasants flirting in the train in la aventura or ferzetti dropping the glass of ink at the end of the same film br br i have reviewed yesterday zabriskie point in this film there are a lot of nice and elaborate shots of the rod taylor office the streets and highways of l a the publicity advertisements the deserts etc that show the fascination of the author in his american journey in the same way than wim wenders years later unfortunately there are too a lot of hippie leftist clichÃ©s that spoil the movie the boy leaves the meeting steals an aeroplane and flies over the desert in order to liberate himself and find something different the executives in grey suites speak all the time about speculation the girl looks at the object women in the swimming pool and leaves because she wants not to be like them the couple of fat middle class in the caravan speak in front of the beauty of the nature of building a hotel and earning a lot of money last but not the least a lot of couples making love in the desert what a hippie platitude br br sorry today half a century after the revolution of la aventura we can see that the king is naked and his films except le amiche and perhaps il grido are only a handful of aestheticism and commonplaces
<START> split second might have been a good movie a story about a road rage homicide has a very young clive owen giving a pretty good performance but but br br unfortunately the filmmakers undercut their own movie with idiotic camera work and truly awful editing the camera jumps all over creation in an unsuccessful attempt i suppose to reflect owen's stress from business family and traffic what this actually does is to give the viewer a headache br br since the filmmakers cared nothing about making a good movie but only to impress each other with their idiotic photography one ought not waste time on this travesty
<START> well there's no real plot to speak of it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex which can sometimes be fun too but it's not in this case what else can i say about this the action when happening is inventive and there's a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper one that has to be several miles high but overall there's not much to recommend kite watch it if you want but you're not missing much if you skip this one
<START> there is a remark that one of heroines was raped on drunken rampage by russian soldiers which is completely untrue this movie should not be shown only because of this br br also there is a statement by someone that kgb prosecuted jews gypsies etc which is worse than nazis kgb was looking for so called zionist agents who were kgb believed imperialist agents this is totally different from targeting jewry as a whole nation as nazis did gypsies were never prosecuted kgb was political tool and used politically but from internationalist standpoint communists really did not distinguish between nationalities br br whole movie stinks like fake main hero does not speak russian signs in berlin contains typographical errors kgb general looks totally phony some so called russian proverbs are totally made up and list goes on and on br br not recommended to watch this movie is full of lies and phony stuff go to good shepherd instead
<START> in hollywood in the 1930's and 1940's i think that every studio can make a western except warner bros the few times they try it always ridiculous except perhaps for they died with their boots on which is a cavalery western i have read that humphrey bogart seing james cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head said that he looks like a mushroom true cagney and bogart are too urban too xxe century to be credible in a western movie the story here had no suprise and it did't help every 10 minutes i figure i can see bogart and cagney drops their little guns and put hands in a machine gun to get away from the set in a 1930's black car
