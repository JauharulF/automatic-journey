<START> although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that weren't exactly true to character this was classic h lots the characters outside of mike giardello giancarlo esposito were true to form and the reunion scenes of pembleton andre braugher and bayliss kyle secor were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen br br homicide the movie aka life everlasting is a fan flick but stands on its own as well as any 2 hour episode of the series fontana overmeyer and yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of the best damn show on television together for the series finale that nbc never bothered to give it true to homicide form there were no happy endings such is life that's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie cutter cop shows left on television kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike br br i call myself a homicidal maniac if for no other reason than to keep my co workers in a cooperative mood
<START> this 1996 movie was the first adaptation of jane eyre that i ever watched and when i did so i was appalled by it so much of the novel had been left out and i considered william hurt to be terribly miscast as rochester since then i have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel the three short versions of '44 '70 and '97 and the three mini series of '73 '83 and 2006 and i have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse rochesters br br this is without doubt the most exquisite jane eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned director franco zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky of lonely rochester standing on a rock and of jane looking out of the window but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life in addition his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes as a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between jane and rochester and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse there are a number of short conversations between rochester and jane each of them beautifully staged but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other we know that they are supposed to fall in love but we never see it actually happen the scene in which rochester wants to find out jane's reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded mason has left the house is completely missing and the farewell scene the most important scene the climax of the novel is reduced to four sentences zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for brontÃ«'s superb lines neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out what remains is just a glimpse of the novel which does no justice to charlotte brontÃ«'s masterpiece br br the cast is a mixed bag while fiona shaw is an excellent mrs reed anna paquin's young jane is more an ill mannered pout lolita than a lonely little girl longing for love the ever reliable joan plowright makes a very likable but far too shrewd mrs fairfaix and one cannot help feeling that billie whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain looking hard working grace poole charlotte gainsbourgh as the grown up heroine however is physically a perfect choice for playing jane eyre looking every bit like 18 thin and frail with irregular strong features she comes closest to my inner vision of jane than any other actress in that role and during the first 15 minutes of her screen time i was enchanted by her performance gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask but unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of jane's character any further as a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues gainsbourgh's portrayal of jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory this is a pity as with a better script charlotte gainsbourgh might have been as good a jane as zelah clarke in the '83 version br br but while it is still obvious that gainsbourgh is trying to play jane there is no trace whatsoever of rochester in the character that william hurt portrays hurt who has proved himself to be a fine actor in many good movies must have been aware that he was physically and type wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the rochester of the novel his rochester besides being blond and blue eyed is a soft spoken well mannered nobleman shy and quiet slightly queer and eccentric but basically good natured and mild he is so far from being irascible moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous additionally during many moments of the movie hurt's facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open if you compare his rochester to the strong willed and charming protagonist of the novel simply bursting with energy and temperament it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in hurt's performance still he offends me less than the rochesters in the '70 '97 and 2006 versions and i would in general rank this jane eyre higher than these three other ones hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so whereas george c scott ciarÃ n hinds and toby stephens thought they could but failed miserably and i'd rather watch a character other than rochester than a rochester who is badly played and i'd rather watch a jane eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today's couple in a starbucks cafÃ© of course this jane eyre is a failure but at least it is an inoffensive one which is more than one can say of the '97 and 2006 adaptations i would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation you will not find jane eyre but at least you will find a beautifully made movie
<START> i knew i was going to see a low budget movie but i expected much more from an alex cox film the acting by the two leading men was terrible especially the white guy the girl should have won an oscar compared to those two this movie was filled with what i guess would be inside jokes for film industry people and a few other jokes that i actually understood and made me laugh out loud which is rare without these laugh out loud moments i would have given this film 2 10 what happened to the alex cox who made all the 80s classics br br spoiler br br there were a couple of questions i had after the movie was over why did the mexican guy go to the other guy's house at the beginning what did his daughter say he got 100 people fired from his last job why was she breaking her own stuff when she was mad at him i guess i should have gone to the q a after the movie but i didn't want to get up at 10am
<START> the imdb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film it should have read 'be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your family's church at 8 years old listening to the preacher drone on about god's will while all you can think of is getting back home to your lego' br br it starts off well intentioned building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as renny's 'how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast ' moment it then slowly morphs into a christian jamboree sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic induced babble i believe i counted the use of the word 'pray' about 53 times in a five minute span near the end after the 31st i tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym 'prey' sadly this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say 'prayer' 'preyer' to me as it became totally zany indeed even my catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom almost to the point of ending up on the floor br br for all the salivating christians who ranked this film 8 10 stars i suggest sticking with your theology reinforcing safety standards like circle square the ten commandments anything from narnia jesus christ superstar and the like stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as jesus camp the god who wasn't there what would jesus buy or the soon to be released religulous br br maybe robert whitlow's book is better
<START> there are some good things about the movie the music and cinematography is great alex wilson is hot and gives a great performance ryan bauer is also hot the production was very lucky to have casted them because they really give production value to the movie jonny vincent sean and a lot of the boys in the movie that don't speak are cute too why isn't the actress who plays amy listed in the credits brandon alexander gives a great comedic performance as clitarissa pink br br the worse thing about the movie is probably the star james townsend he can't act he's also very scrawny not nice to look at at all his arms are like spaghetti it's disgusting they have no muscle tone at all it's no wonder he has to make his own movie and cast himself in it no one else would cast him in anything br br james townsend is not believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so gay they should have casted someone else as the lead if they wanted what's best for the movie then again maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in soft core porn definitely not real acting because he would have taken some acting lessons plus anyone who does porn is blacklisted in hollywood br br the most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a tan skinned latina as devon's mother sonja fisher does not seem like an actress at all all in all this movie is soft core porn and is no better than something you would see on skinemax i think even alex wilson probably the best thing about this movie is embarrassed by it and doesn't want to be associated with it there is no photo on his imdb page and nothing else listed so alex wilson is probably a disposable stage name plus i ran into him in west hollywood one time recently and when i mentioned this movie he just turned around and walked away i understand if i had worked on this movie i would be embarrassed and wouldn't want to be associated with it either
<START> i am not from america and i know what 'wife swap' is when a show came out of that name i was thrilled to see some cool glamorized sexual moments from the program but what i got was a real sucking stupidity i was misjudged by its title name it has no adult contents no nudity not even vulgar dialogues broad casted threw hallmark channel and i think they edited mute out such contents to make it neat br br a show which gives a picture of current american western family state overweight chubby peoples polluted teenagers and their sucking family goings in each episode two wives two mothers more correctly were chosen to live in each others home and re changes each others family routine with their new own rule sometimes its turns out to be good or more evenly bad on the ending section each mothers are brought back with their husband and try to conclude what they did to each families past days it's the sucking portion of the program were each contenders fights for their rights i was sucked to see all of these instead of seeing some cool adult sex stuff i mean who make this program more than that who gave the name wife swap its better to be called as mother swap all in all it corrupts all the great things the real wife swap stands for br br wife swap average sucking reality show
<START> i really enjoyed this movie most of the reviews have been bad but most critics think a movie should be like an idea drama this movie has a little bit of drama but the rest is just clean fun and very entertaining forget about julia roberts being a pretty woman emma roberts is a beautiful young lady and there is more to her than just that emma was so much fun to watch in the role of nancy drew it is good to see a new face i believe she will go far br br nancy drew may not be based upon the books but the story is still good there is also a good blend of other character actors and supporting actors like pat carroll barry bostwick rachel leigh cook and chris kattan not credited i'm surprised disney did not release this movie some people may not like this movie because it does not contain sex violence and cursing this is a good family film which is rare in this day in time so take your family see this movie and judge for your self how good it is i can't wait for the sequel
<START> there was some hesitation from my part about what this movie had to offer for starters the casting didn't seem right kiefer sutherland had already done very well in 24 and the preview didn't seem to offer anything challenging to him or the audience eva longoria appeared out of place and the rest didn't seem very interesting br br when the film finally ended i was not completely displeased for i had seen a decent thriller that could have been much better had the responsible parties taken a little more care to watch for the narrative gaps and given a little more care to character development we have seen threats of this type before and that made the main conflict much more challenging to the writers as an audience we don't want to sit through the same old story again we want to see something different be thrilled and entertained br br there is nothing wrong with the casting from kim basinger's delicious first lady she carries herself with enough grace and sex appeal to make the part memorable michael douglas has been and done that before unfortunately the president is much of a non entity to even care about his fate sutherland rehashes his 24 tough guy approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen and eva does a passable job as the newcomer br br don't expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics north by northwest and the fugitive come to mind leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride for whatever it might be it's o k
<START> i'm not sure what i just couldn't laugh at it i had an open mind i didn't want to be a tight ss about it but i seriously just couldn't laugh at this film it was just not funny to me some parts it seemed like ben stiller and jack black tried too hard just because you put two very funny men together doesn't mean that this is going to be an excellent comedy some movies just shouldn't be made this is one of them because it does a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid i know i know it's a comedy sort of at least but i was just not impressed i'm sorry but i cannot give this anything lower than a two and that's all i'm giving br br 2 10
<START> finally was there released a good modesty blaise movie which not only tells a story but actually tells the real story i admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by peter o'donnell you have a cover story just to tell about how modesty became the magnificent person which she is it is not a movie to attract new fans but a movie to tell the real tale some things could have been better but when you cannot forget the awful movie from '66 then is this a magnificent movie so are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make modesty tell her story
<START> a bickering american family vacationing in the west discover a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert little do they know that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs and a deadly presence is stalking them i generally love mystery horror films like this cube spielberg's duel and the birds are all great examples of movies that give no answers but nonetheless leave us intrigued and wanting more apparently disappearance writer director walter klenhard was trying to make just that kind of film and whether or not he succeeded is up to the viewer i personally think he got about half way there then the film just sunk br br the actors are all kind of just ho hum their not especially bad but we as an audience never really feel their fear and they react to situations in unrealistic ways is anyone else absolutely sick of characters just walking out off to investigate strange sounds at least give them some kind of justification for doing so br br as far as made for tv films go it's an above average fair for sure director klenhard should be commended for really milking the desert environment for everything it offered and some of the setting were striking there's a really cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test ground were the sand had been completely melted to glass for as far as the eye could see i wonder if that was realÂ br br no gore to speak of and the 'creatures'Âor what ever the hell it is that's after these peopleÂare never shown not to mention that we are never even given a real clue as to what they are mutants aliens ghosts or ancient evil indian spiritsÂoh that really narrows it down for us or where the come from br br there are lots of clichÃ©s here too why is it that towns folk in these kinds of films are always really really dumb why is there always an old guy everyone thinks is crazy that turns out to be correct why why why how 'bout a new scenario folks br br disappearance tries to be different and intelligent but ultimately fails in that in many ways it's too familiar to us fans of direct to video horror fodder hey i've seen much worse films and disappearance ain't bad it's just tooÂ average br br 4 10
<START> based on the korean legend unknown creatures will return and devastate the planet reporter ethan kendrick is called in to investigate the matter and he arrives at the conclusion that a girl stricken with a mysterious illness named sarah is suppose to help him the imoogi makes its way to los angeles wreaking havoc and destruction with the entire city under arms will ethan and sarah make it in time to save the people of los angeles written by anonymous i think he should have included the following br br this is the worst movie i have ever seen the best actor in the whole thing was the cg dragon and overall it s u c k ed i am p i s s ed at not only with the people who made it but myself for watching save yourself the time read a book or something maybe a little dr seuss that should be more stimulating br br no wonder the guy is anonymous sorry for the format this site has a lot of rules this is the only way i could get this out without adding more
<START> i was in the film too but i don't know if they actually put this scene in on the way back from a school trip in 2005 we stopped at a service station at the same time as they were doing the film and we were asked the whole of us to run in and shout go freebird we were all around 10 years old could anyone who has seen the film tell me if that part was actually kept in the film it would be great to know i remember i thought the film had never come out because it was another 2 and a half years before it was released all of your comments seem to be good so i'm guessing it has been quite a successful film i might buy it but first i would like to know if i'm in it d thank you
<START> what a crappy movie the worst of the worst this movie is as entertaining as a dead slug no talent what so ever actors stupid plot who wrote this script was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the record button on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what my friends younger brother is in the 6 th grade and him and his classmates just did an amateur movie for their school project which outdid this geeky movie this is by far the worst film i have seen in my life there is just no excuse for this flick
<START> 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter is my opinion is an absolute abc classic i'm not sure i haven't seen every episode but i still enjoyed it it's hard to say which episode was my favorite however i think it was always funny when a mishap occurred i always laughed at that despite the fact that james garner and david spade were good i liked the show more when john ritter was the leading man if you ask me his sudden passing was very tragic everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion i hope some network brings it back on the air for fans of the show to see
<START> in 1990 brad pitt and juiliette lewis did a tv too young to die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in kalifornia i have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film br br kalifornia finds aspiring writer david duchovny and his girl friend art photographer michelle forbes on a rocky relationship of sorts due to duchovny's obsession with writing a book and getting in the minds and souls of serial killers in fact he's got a most unusual odyssey planned he wants to go cross country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers but he and forbes are flat broke br br fate intervenes in more ways than financial with the arrival of brad pitt and juliette lewis a pair of strange southern types who agree to split the cost of gas on this cross country trip it turns out pitt is a serial killer himself and he decides to do a little research on his own delving into the mind of someone who is fascinated with amorality br br kalifornia is not the type of film i usually go for but in fact the acting ability and charisma of brad pitt make it work to a large degree pitt is the walking definition of an inbred gothic refugee from deliverance but better than he is is juliette lewis who once again is playing these low self esteem types which she seems to do well watch her scene with forbes as she does her hair and lewis describes her sad and pathetic life lewis's dialog and forbes's reactions ought to be shown in acting classes around the country br br for those who like their slasher flicks they don't come better than kalifornia
<START> i absolutely love this movie and would really like to have it someday it's just a fascinating legend about an eagle who wears a turquoise necklace i loved it and would like to see it again i don't remember too much about it but that a native american boy lives in a nice village with his family and i don't remember what happens but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone his sister packs him some food and he goes while he's out there some other indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him and he turns into an eagle the legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace it is the boy i was always fascinated with legends particularly native american legends and i would love to see this released someday to a dvd please release it whoever's concerned
<START> revenge on us the viewing public perhaps i sat through this 2 hour movie and i was waiting for the second act to kick in so that the movie lived up to its title but costner never avenges his lovers fate she dies and the movie ends i was left wondering where the rest of the movie was if a movie is called revenge then the hero better get some by the end of the film i had a choice of seeing this or black rain at the cinema thankfully i saw the other brothers movie at the cinema instead i caught up with this turkey on video there was one good thing about the film and was its beautiful theme tune listen to the cd dont watch this its awful 1 out of 10
<START> the wife and i saw a preview of this movie while watching another dvd and thought jon heder diane keaton jeff daniels and eli wallach it's gotta be better than summer reruns so i ordered it from local library well any episode of lawrence welk would bring more laughs than mama's boy i actually felt sorry for the actors for having to read the script in the privacy of their own homes and i couldn't imagine what it must have been like for them to have to actually say their lines in front of a camera perhaps at least maybe next time they're offered a movie of this sort they'll just say no ' a one anna two
<START> i saw this at a screening last night too i was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what i expected not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion br br i won't bother rehashing the plot too much because i think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better but i will say that adam sandler's performance was really refreshing and real he was funny and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies don cheadle was believable as always br br this movie isn't funny like borat or billy madison but it has a good pace about it i'd say 90 of the audience laughed for most of the film midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together br br i also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friend white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves
