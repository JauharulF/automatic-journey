<START> when i first saw the title i was already deducing the theme of the film it clearly wasn't a reference to british currency so it had to be shakespearian and about pounds of flesh taking them or giving them will smith's a feelgood actor so serial killers were out it could only be about a man giving them so must be about guilt somehow i spoilt the whole thing for myself by looking it up and knowing the story before i watched as the beauty of the build up is the way parts of the main character's background are drip fed to slowly illuminate the audience as to who he is and why he is doing what he is doing br br guilt is a very hard subject to do simply because it's deeply uncomfortable and sad which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping for a roller coaster ride you know its going to be unpleasant i wouldn't say the movie glorifies suicide it delves into the most extreme form of self sacrifice martyrdom br br it's also brimming with symbolism everywhere which is a surefire tell tale sign that the writing is cleverly thought out in great detail and driving at multiple meanings and a deep reflective nature the most prominent theme that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically but was giving it to her physically as the greatest gift he could determined to die but his plan is thwarted by falling in love what a 2nd act complication absolutely masterful br br yes it is very slow paced but i'm undecided as to whether it would have been better slotted into a smaller timeframe i didn't feel the strain and his terrible inner turmoil as much as i could have but maybe that's just me having ruined it for myself beforehand saying all that though it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought provoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get
<START> if there has ever been a worse comedy than 'gray matters' i am unaware of it the new york jewish comedy's 'funny' premise is that siblings sam gray are mistaken for a couple and so decide to fix sam up with a girlfriend only to find that gray is equally attracted to their target charlie the revelation that gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her there is a deeply offensive wedding sequence a deeply embarrassing 'drunk act' from moynahan and graham and a performance that would embarrass forests everywhere for its woodenness from tom cavanagh sissy spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will want this excised from her resume molly shannon plays the homely friend with lumpen insouciance only alan cumming emerges with any credit but is seriously under employed and given nothing with which to work the whole disaster is cemented by graham's bizarre eye rolling performance culminating with the penultimate scene where she wears a comedy hat and an overcoat despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar it is astonishing that this film was ever released it has no redeeming feature and should be avoided at all costs
<START> perhaps not the absolute greatest entry in the hammer house of horror series but it surely wins the award for most inventively titled episode the house that bled to death Â i could yell out this title all day without ever getting tired of it and besides the wondrous title this short movie also benefices from a solidly written screenplay and a handful of genuinely suspenseful moments it might require an extra viewing before you fully understand the peculiar end twist but it's definitely an original idea for a horror short the story opens with images of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middle class house the husband sadistically kills his wife and several years later the cursed house is still for sale a young couple and their cherubic daughter move in and start to restore it but mysterious events occur and affect especially the young sophie her beloved cat is killed an even her birthday party gets ruined when one of the house's pipes suddenly sprays blood all over the guests a particularly chilling sequence this one is the old house really haunted or maybe the seemly helpful neighbors cause all the horror the answers to these questions are provided in the original and fairly unpredictable climax and there's even room for a real shock at the very end the tension is masterfully built up and the titular house is filled with eerie scenery like the pair of rusty machetes used by the husband to slay his wife little warning though the sequence with the cat is hard to watch when you're an animal lover in conclusion another winner for hammer's short running tv series
<START> there is something special about the austrian movies not only by seidl but by spielmann and other directors as well this is the piercing sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the movie hundstage is no exception this effect is achieved not only by the depicted stories but also by actors playing in hundstage i have never had the feeling that these are actors playing but real people instead so real is the visceral feeling of the viewer almost as if the grumpy pensioner or lonely lady in the movie are living below you in your block br br any person living in vienna can without any doubt painfully recognize the people in the movie with their meckern sudern complaining their hidden sexual urges and the prolo macho guys this is further reinforced by the viennese dialect which is according to many especially made for complaining as a way of life a special parochialism and arrogance typical for vienna are also very well portrayed br br the viennese suburbs have a vivid presence in the movie with their stupor and drowsiness where nothing happens moreover they have been turned into a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and huge department stores inbetween are the houses of the people where they indulge into what they reckon is pleasure giving activities trying to stay in touch with their human selves yet in vain the examples are the sexual game of the old lady with the men which bordered on rape the prolo guy losing his nerves and hitting his girlfriend and the young woman who hitchhikes and irritates her drivers br br the film has no soundtrack as it concentrates on the normality abnormality of its images only another typical feature of seidl and other austrian directors is his showing of disturbingly sexual images these include the stripping of the old woman for her husband the sexual scenes in the bath the sexual game of the lady with the two men in her apartment etc br br in hundstage seild has portrayed the lives of people who eventually may be as much viennese as they could be citizens of paris new york or madrid the viewers should not despise or feel pity for the viennese in the movie as they themselves could become victims of the same human estrangement and alienation albeit in different circumstances in the end i believe seidl's film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relationships so brutally revealed in hundstage and if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation seidl has achieved his goal
<START> for such a great classic tale the setting location grendel was disappointing as a writer i blame the script which completely lacked dramatic tension the rubric of the club story is useful and would have provided a new take on the literary classic for some weird reason that rubric was dropped early on to know this was shot in 21 days says to me rushed and it unfortunately shows now we'll have to wait for the hollywood version on the big screen i word on fx i can tolerate really crappy cgi but the script has to rock and this one was just too slow spartan and lacking in drama i'd blame it on the actors but since i know writing more than acting i'll pick on my colleague
<START> totally forgettable specially because of the weak acting this is the first movie i've seen with dax shepard to my surprise he's been around since the late 90's i thought he was a newcomer since his acting was so bland i could say the same about liv tyler although i've seen her do well in other movies she gave clare cooper a strange personality liv is not the kind of actress that will give the character a fiery emotional personality like diane keaton would be able to but it was pretty strange to see her say her lines in whisper mode it seemed that altogether there simply wasn't a very good chemistry going on between the actors and i think diane keaton sensed that as well she's a fantastic actress but seemed just a bit over the top in this movie it felt like she just wanted to get this movie over as soon as possible i wouldn't blame her
<START> since this movie was based on a true story of a woman who had two children and was not very well off it was just scary as to how real it really was the acting is what gave the movie that push to greatness br br diane keaton portrayed the main character patsy mccartle who had two sons whom she adored her performance is what made the real life story come to life on a television screen it was very hard to watch some of the scenes since they were so real as to what happens when one becomes addicted to drugs br br just watching this very loving mother go from sweet to not caring at all was hard but so true i have known people who have gone through withdrawl and it was very much like what happened in this movie from what i remember br br i also thought that it was very risky for the director to want to make a movie out of what happened to this woman yet it was done so well i applaud the director for making this movie br br i highly recommend this to anyone who has known someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or to just learn what can happen to you if you do become addicted to them
<START> unlike others i refuse to call this pitiful excuse for a movie a triumph of style over substance i don't want to give style a bad name still it's the most apt description that comes to mind br br a pointless unpleasant and ultimately meaningless assault on the eyes and ears wonderland leaves one wondering only why the film was made in the first place and who in their right mind gave the greenlight to this dreary and tangled mess a biography of porn star john holmes a study of who the man was why he went into the business and how it affected him great bound to be compelling bound to be entertaining bound to be enlightening and fascinating on about a million levels and i have zero interest in porn br br but a confusing violent rashomon style study of a series of murders holmes was connected with after his career ended who in hell cares what insights do we gain this film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of john holmes's life that he was a porno star wonderland might as well have been about anyone the fact that the main character is the most famous male adult film star in history is almost irrelevant br br to make matters about a thousand times worse the picture is loaded down with jerkoff gimmicks annoying machine gun editing sloppy dogme 95 camerawork unnecessary split screen graphics and animation etc etc br br in the absence of a compelling story and unique main character the director and i use the term loosely has thrown together a dozen or so techniques from other films and decided to call the resulting mess a movie among these the trendy bleach bypass look of narc or traffic or minority report the frantic often incomprehensible throw the pieces of film in the air cutting style of natural born killers or 28 days later the fill every moment of silence with an old song to evoke the period soundtrack of goodfellas or blow the groovy retro title sequence of velvet goldmine or autofocus or catch me if you can the list goes on and on and on pathetic br br i wanted to like this movie i had real hopes for it wonderland avenue had been around for years had the context of the murders been emphasized rather than the murders themselves i think it could have worked had the murders and holmes's growing involvement with seedy l a types signaled the end of a career or the end of the swinging '70s i think the film could have had meaning it could have served a purpose as it is meaningless pointless who cares how many perspectives exist on a series of murders generally unknown by the public the case isn't famous enough to merit such painstaking examination br br this film should have been the third act of the john holmes story that's it period and it could have worked what's that oh right right they didn't want to tell a traditional rise and fall story they didn't want to make boogie nights or goodfellas or star 80 or autofocus they wanted their film to be different right br br well in one sense they succeeded there's a big difference between those films and wonderland the difference is those films are good br br
<START> this is a modest character driven comedy filmed in brazil on a low budget the premise is familiar the same as in the 1950's danny kaye movie on the double someone who as a joke does an impression of a famous person then is dragooned to impersonate the person for real br br the contrast between the two leads is highly effective raul julia as the german paradorian secret policeman is tall cool menacing and latin he sports a deliberately obvious blond dye job richard dreyfus animated short new york jewish is funny and sympathetic there are many references and inside jokes about show business br br the setting is clearly modeled on paraguay paraguay was indeed ruled from the early fifties to the late eighties by gen alfredo stroessner an unelected military dictator whose father had emigrated from germany but writer director mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints parador paraguay as a typical latin american tyranny with huge disparities in wealth and an active guerrilla insurgency further in this vein mazursky casts comic jonathan winters as an american retiree who in truth is c i a station chief in parador and a figure so powerful that he can give the president of the country a profanity laced chewing out br br in fact the u s has little influence in paraguay which is largely without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region this is due to the country's having fought long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries the male population was nearly wiped out both times but the society that emerged was patriotic racially homogeneous and strongly united br br on yet another level there is a bow to feminism in the form of the character madonna played by brazilian actress sonia braga madonna is a former nightclub dancer who is the body stockinged presidential pleasure girl at the film's start but is seen on television as president herself at the end now politically and cosmetically correct no makeup hair demurely pulled back swept to office by a velvet revolution br br the one time that such an event actually happened in latin america the administration of argentina's isabel peron not the beloved evita who never held office lasted two years after the death of her husband legendary supremo juan peron
<START> 'blue desert' may have had the potential to be even a half way plausible and more enjoyable thriller had the main character lisa roberts courtney cox not been so stupid when she is the victim of another attack on the streets of new york comic book artist roberts moves to a small town out west in her first days there she meets the suspiciously crazy randall atkins craig sheffer playing this part well who will eventually not leave her side fearing for her safety after having been in the situation already twice before she strikes up a friendship and relationship with the suspiciously amicable town cop steve smith d b sweeny who's character does not seem convincing enough leaving disbelief among viewers who should otherwise be convinced of the red herrings thrown by the writers smith needs roberts cooperation because as he tells her atkins is an ex con and guilty of sexual assault but the cops have lacked the evidence to put him away before br br the movie had enough ploys to at least make an interesting movie because soon enough there is such confusion as to whom roberts should trust however much of the intended suspense appears too forced because roberts character never seems to react to simple things as we think any reasonable person might and her delayed responses allow much of that suspense to occur to easily and unconvincingly particularly in the finale perhaps sweeny was the wrong choice for this role too baby faced in ways that kind of recall kevin anderson's persona evident in his character in 'sleeping with the enemy ' or if lisa roberts was written as a stronger character this might suffice as well in the meantime the film is not all that great even as a low budget b thriller
<START> there are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis have kept psychologists counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades occasionally some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence that is the premise of the film entitled the night listner it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon robin williams who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles perhaps its because his show is losing it's authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself feeling abandoned by both his lover jess bobby cannavale and his and best friend joe morton he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation it is here a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called peter rory culkin in reading the boy's harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents noon is captivated and wants to help however things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d logand sandra oh as anna and john cullum as pop this might be comical instead this may prove to be one of william's more serious performances
<START> to be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it but i'm never one to let others influence my viewings in fact i'm more likely to watch something out of defiance bullwhip had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway the fact that rhonda fleming and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away the picture isn't very good and is in fact very morally dubious all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way shape or form all motivated by greed or egocentric victories this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax shuddering picture sadly it doesn't and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you can't help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film nobody in the cast come out with any credit with lead man guy madison painfully wooden in the extreme br br not even the lovely rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone 3 10
<START> i'll keep this short as i know i don't need to say much br br alive is a strange little film that obviously appeals to some but i found it to be shockingly bland from almost the very beginning the film did very little to make any of the characters likable and the story at times became so convoluted that i completely lost interest as i said i know others enjoyed it but i found kitamura's alive to be anything but a lame extremely boring drama disguised as a thought provoking action sci fi flick i felt like i was suckered into watching this film based by its intriguing premise and uber exciting cover art br br my suggestion pass it up for kitamura's far more enjoyable freshman effort versus or his 2004 riot godzilla final wars br br and don't get me wrong i'm always up for a good thinking man's film but this certainly wasn't it there was nary a moment that i actually cared about a single event taking place in this overly preachy dialogue heavy movie br br if you wanna talk about something talk about boring
<START> connie hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times br br that's it folks the sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not br br these 70s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness flared trousers big hair zapata moustaches etc this one isn't br br the script is bad the acting is bad the direction is bad and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad br br the title hinting at a sex comedy is grossly misleading br br i heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague
<START> we have to remember that the 50's were practically a blank slate when it came to movies hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies noir two reel oaters etc to movies with a message we had blackboard jungle on the waterfront and so on some folks might think that was an improvement i don't who was the mogul who said if you want to send a message call western union he was right these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy br br this one is a pip it's about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father's estate one of them maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay he's initially in it for the bucks but eventually falls for her meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance the results are predictable you get a little bit of everything in this movie sexual tension between the sisters a little subtle masochism hereditary insanity if there is such a thing we never get to meet the parents but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar the acting is so bad it's hard to believe it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called bel air productions it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene br br i can't explain it not even to myself but i gave this pile of trash an 8 10 i'm familiar with the term it's so bad it's good but i don't think i ever ran into the phenomenon before well maybe hot rods to hell but this one certainly fits you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody's basement

<START> first off i'm a huge fan of 80s movies and of jennifer conelly as well so yesterday i wandered into a local used book movie store and found a vhs copy i read the back and it sounded good and for 3 99 it was a good deal so i took it home and popped it in the vcr what a sweet movie at my age now i relate more to movies like about last night or st elmo's fire but still i remember what it was like to be 15 16 and in love with an older guy etc we all have those little crushes when we're younger and if it doesn't work out we're heartbroken and we think that we'll never get over it but of course we do many times it's that sort of sweet quality that i really got from this movie the feeling of oooh i remember when something like that happened to me is all through it the characters are interesting and well developed i recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies teen films in particular or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives
<START> all in all a good film and better for the fact that had the film not been made the story might remain hidden to the masses brosnan does a good job as the native american with a hidden past and the photography is stunning to some this may be too whimsical to others boring for me it is a gentle well told tale and perfect for family viewing now that's not something you get a lot of recently
<START> i remember following the case of andre chicatillo in the newspapers while i was living in south africa they had photos of him sitting in his cage while being prosecuted in court not as it turned out to protect the court members but to protect him from the public this was fascinating albeit morbid reading i later heard that a film had been made by hbo about the case but it was made for american tv bummed strangely citizen x got a limited cinematic release in south africa i charged down to the local ster kinekor complex and duly bought a ticket i was alone my girlfriend at the time was only interested in the likes of steel magnolias and fried green tomatoes wow what a brilliant film why wasn't it released to a wider audience had it not been made for tv it could have got an oscar nomination or 2 there is no way to spoil the ending who the killer is is never kept from the audience jeffrey demunn portrays a truly terrifying psycho he is calm downtrodden considered a failure by his wife and subjected to constant ridicule and humiliation by his superiors at work by committing these horrendous acts he gets to feel strong powerful br br fighting to catch him against all odds is a pathologist played to excellent turn by stephen rea in one of his strongest performances he must battle the snail pace of russian bureaucracy the primitive resources he has at his disposal and above all the refusal by his superiors to acknowledge that the ussr even has a serial killer the general in charge joss ackland says that serial killers are a decadent western phenomenon only donald sutherland is willing to help but his help must be under the counter the ever brilliant max von sydow plays a russian psychiatrist who breaks protocol and decides to help the investigators in their quest it is the first time in russian history that a shrink is used to build a profile of a serial killer still on the loose and he has everything to lose if his involvement is made public br br citizen x is brilliantly acted well written and the music and editing only add to the tension and theme of the film excellent support from a horribly underused imelda staunton and a real sense of impending doom make citizen x a film worth seeing this was too good to be made for tv
<START> series 2 has got off to a great start i don't think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them and this show makes you think like that these 4 30 something women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is believable and realistic so the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are exciting to watch but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women too its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices
