<START> this movie is another fine example of what jerry bruckheimer since about 1997 seems to be best at hyping up a movie a year before its release and not coming through with a quality movie i'm no film critic but this movie was as predictable as they come every attempt at a joke every attempt at a touching moment and the pitiful attempt at a love story was exactly what i was predicting in my mind do yourself a favor and save your money on this one
<START> okay so there is a front view of a checker taxi probably late 1930s model it has the great triangular shaped headlights there also is a desoto cab in this black and white character driven almost a musical love gone wrong story br br the real pleasure here is the look at 1940s room interiors and fashions and hotel elevators the hair styles male and female are gorgeous if dolly parton had victor mature's hair she could have made it big there is an artist loft that would be the envy of every andy warhol wannabe br br if you watch this expecting a great casablanca storyline or sound of music oom pah pah you will be disappointed there is a nice little story beneath the runway model approach in this film br br my copy on dvd with another movie for 1 was very viewable the title sequence was cute but not up there with mad mad mad mad world or the pink panther this was an rko movie but it did not have the nice airplane logo that rko used to use br br i liked victor mature in one million b c and sampson and delilah and especially in violent saturday see if you can find that one he was wonderful in the comedy with peter sellers called caccia alla volpe or after the fox br br richard carlson went on to do i led three lives on tv in the early 1950s br br vic mature was offered the part of sampson's father in the remake of sampson and delilah he supposedly was asked if he would have any problems playing the part of the father since he was so well known as sampson victor replied if the money is right i'll play sampson's mother br br tom willett
<START> katherine heigl marley shelton denise richards david boreanaz even before i knew what this film was about these names were enough to draw me in gorgeous talented and popular these are performers to look out for br br ok where do i start we already know what the film is about five beautiful girls being targeted by a 'romantic' serial slasher a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago his trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards maggot infested chocolates and a bleeding nose his weapon of choice well take a pick axe knife electric powerdrill bow and arrow hot iron etc ok so basically it's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality br br horror movies aren't supposed to be shakespeare but i'm not gonna go there i love horror movies but not all of them this one i adore it's up there with some of my other favorites it's funny sexy and scary the killer's mask is childishly creepy and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky the acting is topnotch denise richards marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun i really did wish to see much much more of katherine heigl i am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon jessica capshaw is a very capable actress and jessica cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in urban legend 2 the smaller parts were also good hedy buress was a hoot 'bleedmedry com' and that younger version of denise richards looked frightfully like her br br highlights every death scene had a particular distinction to it the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue the hottub scene while ludicrous was well done and the audiovisual maze was sinister the soundtrack is great with creepy music and some fine alternative tunes br br lowpoint i felt as though the killer wasn't featured enough we barely saw the mask and it wasn't featured at all during the climax i also thought the climax was really unfocused but fun nonetheless br br the twist at the end wasn't that big of a surprise but i'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole 'explaining killer' routine br br i don't like to tell people which movies they should see but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing then valentine would be it br br my rating 10 10 bullseye
<START> this tv series was one of the ones i loved when i was a kid even though i see it now through the pink shaded glasses of nostalgia i can still tell it was a quality show very educational but still funny i have not seen the original french version only the swedish i have no idea how good the dubbing was it was too long ago to remember br br the premise of the show was to show you how the body works i swear school still hasn't taught me half of what i know from this show it also tied in other things like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and don't exercise with nice examples within the body who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you d the cartoon looked nice very kids friendly of course but done with care cells viruses electric signals in the brain antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures looking pretty much how you'd expect what they should look like in the animated body br br this and the series about history especially the environmentally scary finale were key parts of my childhood i'm so happy i found them here
<START> hi im scott a k a woody7739 i love the film twisted desire and i love watching melissa joan hart on the t v as i think she is fine i am a real fan of sabrina the teenage witch too so this helped my watch it don't ask i love the way that nicole plans out her parents murder very carfully as she makes sure that someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the bottles so she wont give away her fingerprints a very well planned out idea back i guess it all backfired on nicole as she got caught as her old boyfriend comes along and puts a hidden camera under his shirt i give this film a nine out of ten and put it in my top 10 films list and last but not least if anyone see's this film in the shops please tell me as i seen it on tv and didn't record it bye
<START> a bloody gangster story which takes place in the years of great depression it tells us about another notorious hit man michael mike salliwan somehow this time the story turns the other way round mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son because the rest of his family was killed due to dirty game of his own boss he succeeds in his revenge and secures honorable future to his son but gets killed in the end such stories never have happy end after all br br the role of mike salliwan senior was wonderfully played by tom hanks and the part of mr rooney the mafia boss was performed by paul newman the film makes a great impression and we hear the well known phrase we rob banks this film is still worth watching although you could have expected something bigger from sam mendes after his american beauty
<START> the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitute's return to her home village for the funeral of a sister friend there are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken but they are not fully explored the core of the movie is the funeral wake and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable apparently the movie is unedited the prostitute's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud maybe that's supposed to impress us with the immensity of the russian landscape the village itself such as it is is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male the consort of the dead girl continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible most of the film is shot with a hand held camera that could induce nausea another problem for western viewers is that subtitles don't include the songs and laments of the crones don't go to this movie unless you're fluent in russian
<START> awful dreams wild premonitions blasphemy and homosexual fantasies permeate paul verhoeven's arguable masterpiece of a true femme fatale who loves her men then kills them filled with blood and occasional gore the fourth man is truly neurosis inducing men will literally leap when renee swings out her scissors
<START> i wouldn't say this is a bad movie unfortunately for me i get the feeling that the more you know about fencing the worse it gets simply due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic i've been fencing since i was 14 years old and this movie portrays it very poorly f murray abraham is good and appears to have some fencing background but most of the other actors especially the students just seem to be lost
<START> what's the best way to start a review of a movie like der todesking let me start by saying i've just come direct from viewing this movie and the images are still burned deep into my brain and i don't think they'll be moving any time soon br br it's probably fair to say that if you're on this page you have a good idea what sort of film this is even if you haven't seen it if not let me forewarn you that this is not a moderate budget gem that's been lost for a few years a la near dark nor is it a low budget schlocky fun b movie what it is it low budget art put forward in a simple yet poignant way the idea is a simple one seven stories revolving around and ending in suicides interspersed with footage of a decomposing corpse sounds simple right even boring it isn't words can't really describe how powerful this film becomes by the time you are halfway through it virtually draws you into it whether you want to go or not br br i could go on a ramble here about the technical pros and cons of the direction maybe point out that the scenes are obviously shot on super 8 cameras and are at sometimes shaky i could point out that some of the sound effects are out of sync in a way to rival any fulci movie but at the end of the day this all seems to pale into insignificance br br as far as extreme movies go i've seen the hardest of them and yet der todesking moved me in a way that few others have managed despite not being particularly gory and having very few scenes that i would consider gratuitous in fact the most disturbing scene i found was the last tale i won't ruin it just to say that the character's emotional agony virtually drips from the screen and makes you sympathise if not yearn for his end br br sure it's not the best movie ever made and in a lot of places is seems crude and maybe a little amateurish but in spite of these flaws der todesking is an experience i would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema if you're someone who likes comfortable viewing or nice movies or simply wants to gross out on something brutal and pointless this is not what you're looking for br br whether you enjoy it or not it's one you won't forget in a hurry
<START> about the only thing i liked about this film is that there was just enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end i kept thinking that maybe in the next scene things would gel alas br br those who like gus van sant's films especially his later ones will probably like this personally i find van sant's films to be dull pretentious and facile well he was an executive producer for this film so it is no surprise that the film could almost have been made by him although personally i actually liked this better than van sant's latest efforts e g elephant br br contrary to many here i did not think the film was difficult to understand or disjointed i thought that above all it is a film that wishes to portray a certain mood the mood of an adolescent moving slowly into the adult world but so slowly that the changes are barely visible if at all but i feel that the problem with the film is that mood is not enough and not only that but that the mood painted here is to my mind incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening the dream like quality so closely linked to nature is beautifully captured here but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold waves on a beach grasses and flowers spiders etc the rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when i was about eight or nine there is a languor to the film that is in opposition to what should be a very tense time in an adolescent life when you are caught up in a crush on someone or being the object of bullying at school you are anything but languorous there are only two moments that truly worked for me in the film spoilers here first when logan drops the groceries and his mother throws a bit of a fit the frustrations of an adult dealing with a klutzy kid especially with no father present seemed real to me br br the second and only part of the film with any tension to it were the scenes where leah logan's re creation of himself phones rodeo and tries to seduce him into phone sex the first reason i liked it is because the person who did the voice over of leah was the most convincing actor in the entire film it made me think of claire danes from my so called life the voice even sounded like claire she and rodeo had the only scenes that seemed totally believable between the kids and what i especially liked was the fact that rodeo only pretended to play along it was perhaps the best moment in the film as finally we got some character development br br all in all a somewhat misplaced effort we will have to see what he does in his next film before we can really say much about the director's possible talents in the meantime if he can get away from van sant's influence it might do him a world of good who is this director anyhow one of van sant's boy toys
<START> it seems that several of the people who have reviewed this movie only watched it in the first place because it was filmed near where they live how's that for a ringing endorsement if this movie was filmed near where i lived i wouldn't be mentioning it in my review it is horrid several reviews state that this film is a spoof or tongue in cheek horror movie it is neither it is sad to see this film reviewed as a comedy as that makes it not only a bad attempt at a horror film but as a comedy as well i did laugh though at how unbelievably bad the film was br br this movie has 2 good things going for it the mask and the weapon of choice unfortunately it would have been more interesting watching an hour and a half of the mask and weapon laying on a table then watching this garbage the social commentary behind the film is also laughable juvenile and stupid don't bother with this movie you've already wasted time reading this review don't waste anymore on this movie arrggghhh it's infuriating that movies like this even get made i was expecting the entire cast a crew to be credited to alan smithee a name used when a person usually a director doesn't want to be credited with a movie because it's so bad br br there is nothing redeeming in this movie i spent 1 19 on the rental and feel i was ripped off avoid 1 out of 10
<START> after reading the book i happened across this dvd at wal mart for 3 bucks and thought sure what the hell i got the dvd and watched it last night when i started watching it i checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes i thought ok cool it seemed to run rather slowly knowing the story and how much of it there was by the time i got to the actual killings i was like how much time does this have left checked one minute what the hell i felt incredibly cheated thinking that the movie only progressed through a third of the overall story br br but then i happily noticed that the dvd's scene selection menu included a part 1 and a part 2 i still had another hour and a half to go i then sat very happily and enjoyed the second half of the movie even more so than the first br br i admit that i have not seen the 1967 original film despite my sincerest desire to i have however read the novel and felt that this was a fairly descent film for a two part tv miniseries that is i think the casting of the role of perry was completely wrong and a few minor inconsistencies jumped out at me but still very well done the first half drags on a bit while the second half is much more gripping i think they should have proportioned the movie more like capote did his book 1 3 before the murders 1 3 after and 1 3 after the killers are arrested instead the film makes it more 1 2 before the murders 1 4 after and 1 4 after the killers are arrested again this makes the second half more exciting but at the same time less compelling while making the first half drag on and on br br now i look back and realize i have just made the same mistake about making things drag on and on so i will shut the hell up go watch the movie and make up your own damn mind br br nick houston
<START> drones ethnic drumming bad synthesizer piping children singing the most patronizing world music imaginable this is a tourist film and a lousy one what really kills it is the incoherent sequences india egypt south america africa etc etc no transitions no visual explanation of why we're suddenly ten thousand miles away no ideas expressed in images just a bunch of footage of third worlders with baskets on their heads as another reviewer said walking along endlessly as if that had some deep meaning if these guys wanted to make a 3rd world music video all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of koya were shot and film in mexico that would have been a much better setting for life in transformation br br but no what they decided on was a scrambled tourist itinerary covering half the globe and mind deadeningly overcranked filter shots the only thing to recommend this film is that it doesn't suck quite as much as naqoyqatsi br br rstj
<START> this movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that i've spent in a very very long time if you knew how often i went to the movies you'd probably say that's hard to imagine but never the less it's true after seeing the trailer for this movie i knew that i had to see it if you're a fan of horror mystery and suspense why wouldn't you the trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting unfortunately the movie is none of these br br from the cinematography to the script to the acting this movie is a complete flop if you're reading this planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills mystery action horror or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty five minutes i'm afraid you are in for disappointment br br why is it so bad you might be asking yourself let me tell you the movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful nothing about the movie made me the least bit on edge frightened or curious the script was at best laughable there were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous i began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn't the acting was absolutely dreadful i like nicholas cage but this was a miss without exception every performance in this movie was incredibly below average the cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique finally the story is completely transparent you can see the end of this movie coming a mile away br br i am not usually a very harsh critic frankly when i go to see a comedy i want to laugh and when i go to see a mystery suspense horror i just want to be surprised this movie was boring poorly acted poorly written and an overwhelming disappointment do yourself a favor and go see something else
<START> i went to see it 2 times this movie a friend of mine went to see it at the release party and he was telling me it was so great that i was expecting very much about the movie to mutch i couldn't enjoy it because i was not watching it in nuteral position the second time i knew what to expect and i enjoyed it more than the first time after the second time i felt so in the mood to have a party i loved the music it's just great br br if tom barman improves his directing talent he will be a director where everyone will be talking about if you can delivere this movie as your first you must be talented br br the acting is done by some great belgian stars dirk roofthooft and a bunch of upcomming talents like titus de voogdt br br
<START> in don siegel's 1971 masterpiece dirty harry clint eastwood epitomized the super tough super cool unorthodox no nonsense cinema cop with his role of the eponymous inspector 'dirty' harry callahan two sequels followed the first of which magnum force tamed down on the delightfully politically incorrect attitude of the first one that had outraged many critics but enthused audiences the second sequel the enforcer was grittier again and was promoted as the dirtiest harry of them all this title however truly belongs to the fourth film in the series clint eastwood's own sudden impact which is doubtlessly the grittiest nastiest most violent and downright dirtiest of all harry films and in my humble opinion the second best after the masterpiece original br br warning spoilers ahead in a small town near san francisco a mysterious sexy lady sondra locke lures men into being alone with her what these men don't know is that mysterious beauty is their former rape victim longing for bloody revenge as fate wants it san francisco's toughest cop inspector dirty harry callahan who has been suspended once again for angering his superiors spends his leisure time in this exact little town sudden impact is the dirtiest callahan film in several aspects the film is extremely gritty and graphically violent harry callahan himself is dirtier than ever not afraid to make use of his 44 magnum in order to stop trouble harry treats 'punks' as they are to be treated and even allows a person to get away with several murders because the revenge murders are justified in his opinion clint eastwood is as always brilliant in the role of harry callahan eastwood epitomized coolness and bad assery as the man with no name in sergio leone's dollar trilogy and he did so again in the dirty harry films sudden impact gives us the dirtiest harry we have ever seen eastwood's real life girlfriend sondra locke fits very well in the role of the vengeful beauty the great pat hingle who had already worked with eastwood in ted post's tough minded western hang 'em high in 1986 plays the police chief of the small town the film furthermore includes a wide range of truly despicable scumbag characters including a pathetic criminal played by kevin major howard best known for his role in stanley kubrick's full metal jacket and a woman named ray perkins audrie j neenan doubtlessly one of the most disgusting and despicable female characters ever in cinema albert popwell who played the bank robber in the famous do you feel lucky scene in dirty harry and the black militant leader in the enforcer is also part of this one again this time as harry's colleague and buddy overall sudden impact is the grittiest dirtiest and probably the most violent of all dirty harry films though the dead pool isn't exactly tame either and my second favorite after the brilliant 1971 original an absolute must see for callahan fans and highly recommended to all lovers of police thrillers and cinematic bad assery my rating 8 5 10

<START> in loving memory of david tomlinson 1917 2000 br br when i watched this movie for the first time i was 4 years old and i got fascinated by this story of witches in the 2nd world war the scene which impressed me the most was the fight between the nazi soldiers and the medieval army it was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to fight the astonished singing their march this movie is fantastic from the trip to portobello road which became to me the most fantastic place of london to the journey to naboomboo angela lansbury and david tomlinson are really a fantastic couple she is always great it seems the good aunt of a family and david with his always astonished face is her great co protagonist we'll miss him a lot
<START> i have to say i loved vanishing point i've seen the original and this is a pretty good remake of it even though it didn't follow the original storyline that's why i gave it 8 out of 10 it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline br br as for the car well the dj's comment at the end about the challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable and if you look the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145 150 but even though i didn't see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine the original storyline had a supercharged hemi so it's possible for those of you who say aerodynamics wouldn't allow it the normally aspirated chrysler 300c of today can go 168 mph and if you look at that thing going on a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph plus in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic
