<START> i have loved this movie since i first saw it in 1979 i'm still amazed at how accurately kurt russell portrays elvis right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face sometimes its scary how much he looks acts and talks like the real elvis thankfully this is being released on dvd so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film i have heard the detractors who say that there are some inaccuracies or some things left out but i think that keeping in mind that john carpenter only had about 2 1 2 hours to work with and that this was being shown on television just two years after elvis's death that he did a fine job with this in fact i haven't seen another elvis movie that even comes close to this one highly recommended
<START> i and a friend rented this movie we both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging the movie's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending we both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot
<START> spoilers many different comedy series nowadays have at one point or another experimented with the idea of obscure independence in an early episode of cartoon family guy the griffin family find their home is an independent nation to the united states of america and the story progresses from there way back in 1949 however the ealing studios produced a wonderful little film along the same idea br br after a child's prank the residents of pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure at the inquest it becomes clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of burgundy withdrawing from london and the rest of great britain the residents of the small street experience the joys and the problems with being an independent state br br based at a time when rationing was still in operation this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring featuring performances by stanley holloway betty warren philip stainton and a young charles hawtrey the film is well stocked with some of the finest actors of their generation these actors are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking lines feeling remarkably fresh despite being over 50 years old the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertained br br ealing studios was one of the finest exporters of british film ever in existence with films like passport to pimlico it's not difficult to see why amusing from start to finish the story is always fun and always worth watching
<START> i have the entire weissmuller tarzan series on dvd fully restored editions i never tire of watching them my personal favorite is tarzan and his mate due entirely well almost entirely to maureen o'sullivan's costume and the occasional flashes of her genital area beneath that leather flap hanging in front before anyone claims that a it wasn't really her or b it wasn't really what it looks like let me say that i have watched it numerous time in high zoom mode and trust me it is her and she is completely naked underneath that costume several times especially during the lion attack at the end careful viewing in slow motion and maximum zoom will reveal that she was shaved except for a tiny patch of dark hair covering her labia there is no mistake about that at all as to the swimming scene being a body double in a skin suit yes it is a double but she is not wearing any skin suit or anything else again slow motion and maximum zoom shows everything to those who want to see it now that controversy out of the way let's move on the actual movie i thought the script was really well thought out and written tightly the action sequences were simply great although it is obviously a stuntman riding the rhino weissmuller actually wrestles the big male lion the use of background shots that were second unit stuff from africa is very well blended with the studio us locations making it sometimes hard to tell which is which don't complain too much though remember that 90 of all films is phony anyway so just relax and enjoy the damned thing with a big bowl of popcorn some cold beer and a fresh pack of smokes a sexy and willing girlfriend wife isn't out of line either lol oh one final word about nudity at the very beginning while the white hunters are speaking dialogue keep your eyes on the background extras there are several good shots of nude african girls obviously shot on location behind them one more thing the movie is not racist by the standards of the 1930's until the 1960's that's the way colored people were thought of and portrayed back then shaft hadn't even been thought about at that time nor would audiences have accepted any other portrayals of them at the time in history safaris actually did use natives carrying luggage on their heads and tiny's character did die a heroic death trying to save the white hunters and jane as a matter of fact it wasn't until gene autry treated the native americans and colored people in his westerns like real human beings that hollywood began to see that it was okay to do so
<START> this film has been on my wish list for ten years and i only recently found it on dvd when my partner's grandson was given it he watched it at and was thrilled to learn that it was about my generation born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and he wanted to know more about it and me luckily i borrowed it from him and watched it on my own and i cried all through it not only did it capture the emotions the class distinction the hardship and the warmth of human relationships of those years as well as the cruelties spoken and unspoken but it was accurate i am also a bit of an anorak when it comes to arp uniforms ambulances lcc in the right colour white and all the impedimenta of the management of bomb sites and the work of the heavy rescue brigades i couldn't fault any of this from my memories and the sandbagged anderson shelter and the wvs canteens brought it all back the difference between the relatively unspoiled life in the village and war torn london was also sharply presented i re lived 1939 40 and my own evacuation from london with this production i know jack gold's work of course and one would expect no more from him than this meticulous detail but it went far beyond the accurate representation of the facts and touched deep chords about human responses and the only half uttered value judgements of those years it was certainly one of the great high spots in john thaw's acting career and of gold's direction and deserves to be better known it is a magnificent film and i have already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends
<START> i believe this is the most powerful film hbo pictures has made to date this film should have been released in theaters for the public to view on the big screen it is available on video so make sure you look for it and check it out chris gerolmo did a great job with the direction and the screenplay the performances from stephen rea donald sutherland and jeffery demunn are flawless a masterpiece of the genre
<START> well if you are looking for a great mind control movie this is it no movie has had so many gorgeous women under mind control and naked marie forsa as the busty helga is under just about everytime she falls asleep and a few times when she isn't one wishes they made more movies like this one
<START> for animation buffs it's a must but even general audiences will enjoy the cameraman's revenge a very early example of 'pixilation' by the hard working pioneer wladyslaw starewicz starewicz and his helpers painstakingly manipulated a cast of flexible insect figures to tell this story paving the way for the likes of willis o'brien george pal ray harryhausen and legions of modern digital effect creators br br the cameraman's revenge is only about 10 minutes long but packs in lots of amusing detail as the story follows the amorous adventures of two beetles from their home to a nightclub a hotel a cinema and eventually a prison cell there are two brief dance numbers at the nightclub performed by a frog and a dragonfly a scuffle between a beetle and a grasshopper and a large scale donnybrook at the cinema which ends with the projector bursting into flames pretty elaborate goings on for 1912 when even john bray and winsor maccay were just getting started and walt disney was still in grade school br br it's interesting to note too what an impact the alteration of a silent movie's title cards can have on the story being told i've seen two versions of this film offered by two video companies and watched them back to back and although the image content itself is almost identical two different sets of intertitles tell two very different stories and the plot outline someone provided above tells yet a third story which suggests that there's another version out there somewhere the british film institute's print which has rhyming intertitles tells the story of two sibling beetles each secretly married who hide this information from one another in order to inherit their late father's fortune the other russian print tells a simpler story of married beetles who are each guilty of infidelity in the russian version mr beetle visits his girlfriend at the gay dragonfly nightclub while in the english version brother bill beetle visits his wife at the music hall personally i prefer the straightforward and spicier russian story the bfi version tries to cram too much plot into what should be a simple tale and some of the rhymes are a bit awkward br br still in any rendition the cameraman's revenge is a delightful film and would make an ideal lead in to that other great animated work which features beetles yellow submarine
<START> i love this film 'spring and port wine' i was born in leigh a town about 7 miles away from bolton i moved to bolton in 1965 when i was 20 my place of work was daily via little lever through farnworth sometimes on a bike but then by car when i could afford it the film brings back all the memories of the working class neighbors who were almost always broke but who would always help you if they could fred dibnah was round the corner from bromwich st were my bedsit was if you didn't see the film when first released then you may be forgiven for comparing it to a soap such as coronation st well i agree it is a soap but then it was called 'kitchen sink drama ' watch this film for the talented cast who shortly afterwards became household names from frequent roles on tv i watch mainly for the shots of the locality and the feel good factor of people being poor but happy
<START> yakitate ja pan translated as fresh baked japanese bread is the story of a young man named azuma kazuma and his journey to make the perfect japanese bread or ja pan for japan and for the japanese that will be recognized the the whole world br br of course that's just on the outside in reality yakitate ja pan isn't really about the bread but the reaction that come after eating the bread and the pun that comes with the reaction the series is lovable because of these puns from popular anime titles like naruto detective conan and dragon ball to blockbuster movies like the matrix and lord of the rings it's all there br br so what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre like cooking master boy or mr ajikko well unlike the others who use cooking for world domination yakitate ja pan is purely comedy sure there are times that the story turns to drama or even murder but the comedic atmosphere makes you laugh at them you'll be laughing at their own view of heaven just watch it br br just remember that this is also fiction although some of the bread made here are based on real bread eating the home made japan 2 won't turn you to a super saiyan or turn your body to rubber
<START> the explosion of tv channels must be eternally grateful to the randolph scott western production line because any any moment there must be one of what seems like a hundred randolph scott movies playing on at least one no budget station br br man behind the gun is a typical early 1950's period melodrama with pre wwii production values that relies on a historically topical murder mystery plot peppered with action scenes to disguise the script's complete absence of character development and thus lack of suspense in years to come the role of these films would be taken over by tv shows like 'gunsmoke' 'bonanza' etc and these actually did the job better randolph scott looking particularly grizzled in this is the good guy struggling against the bad guys against whom he will eventually prevail there's no more interest in what he goes through emotionally than in what his horse is feeling unless you count wondering whether he'll sort out the initial misunderstanding with the female lead by the end the music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the 'characters' than the acting is but it's fine if that floats your boat and i wouldn't berate you for enjoying 'diagnosis murder' either br br workmanlike pedestrian and ageing rapidly 3 stars for being competently put together 0 for artistic endeavour
<START> i enjoy ralph bakshi films wizards cool world and the underrated animated lord of the rings and am a frank frazetta collector and fan i am also a sword and sorcery fan who loves the worlds of edgar rice burroughs and robert e howard br br i missed fire and ice's theatrical release back in 1983 and have looked forward to seeing it on video or at some revival ever since then therefore the 2005 release was a dream come true for me however i bought it with some trepidation because i hoped it would not be only worth watching once and then put on the shelf as a collectible gathering dust until the day i died fortunately my fears were groundless and i was pleasantly impressed with this movie br br as with frazetta art this is a gritty film that has a physicality and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasy sword and sorcery films without being cheesy or dirty the art is good and you see glimpses of frazetta at his best even my young boys loved watching it with me and ask to watch it again and again however my wife has some objections due to the scantily clad princess very frazetta esquire i don't mind that because it is believable and there is no sex scene br br there is roto scoping used but personally i enjoy roto scoping it gives more fluid and realistic movements to the characters that is hard to find in animation br br despite some continuity problems i recommend this film to all bakshi frazetta conan and sword and sorcery fans enjoy
<START> bette midler is indescribable in this concert she gives her all every time she is on stage whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads bette midler moves her audience if you can't see it live which is the best way to see bette then this is the next best thing an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power her more vocally correct version of stay with me never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever i will treasure this concert for a very long time
<START> girlfight is much more of a coming of age story than it is a fight flick and what a relief to have one in an urban school with naturalistic realistic latinos and believable use of brooklyn project settings br br it made me realize that virtually all hollywood high school movies are set in luxurious suburbia or small towns even the somewhat comparable love and basketball which focused on teen african americans was set in suburbia while these kids share some of the same peer problems those issues shrink compared to the other struggles of these kids where high school graduation could be the major accomplishment of their lives br br the feminist element here is riveting in its originality as you hold your breath to see if she can have a relationship and a victory on her terms a lots of audience sympathy goes to the guy who is challenged to rise to a gender bending expectations situation br br the movie does drag a bit here and there but this is no cheap thrills rocky fight movie as the practices and fights have complex outcomes and all the relationships especially with fathers and father figures take more center stage than the center ring br br there were lots of interesting music credits listed at the end but i hadn't really noticed the songs br br originally written 10 7 2000
<START> this is the one in which the diminutive ruth gordon plays an agatha christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation while gordon is traveling back and forth to new york he manages however to leave behind some clues scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well hidden note columbo enters the case suspects her at once and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers oh and mariette hartley is on hand as gordon's secretary and would be blackmailer hartley is i believe the grand daughter of the psychologist b f skinner i'm not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button which is on display during a belly dance sequence but i've always admired skinner anyway br br the murder is well handled it's a good plot and none of the performers or crew fluff anything but the outstanding figure here is ruth gordon only a skosh over five feet tall she was over 80 years old and looked it there are moments when she almost teeters but she consistently exudes charm her acting is idiosyncratic you can never be sure when she's being serious or when she's putting columbo and the audience on she's given some good lines too what humor there is comes from gordon columbo doesn't have any of his frequent comic moments br br all in all a nice job by everyone concerned
<START> i read schneebaum's book same title as this film when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of otherness his own and the people of the amazon with whom he lived and loved to a way of living a decent life his subsequent books were not as powerful but showed his continuing quest his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60's but his honesty and openness about it were welcome this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence which is not a morally positive term in this case that occurs when civilized men intrude on traditional societies even so schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness
<START> a 14 year old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17 year old boy that lives near by while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister that is the simple premise of this beautiful poetic coming of age film from director robert mulligan mulligan is famous for previously directing summer of '42 in 1971 and to kill a mockingbird in 1962 two giants of the coming of age genre here he directs newcomers in the principal roles reese witherspoon in her film debut as the 14 year old girl emily warfield as the older sister jason london as court the 17 year old boy reese witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut displaying every emotion that a 14 year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt never striking a false note warfield and london are both equally good as well the film accurately depicts each adolescent's thoughts or feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity never crossing over into maudlin excess even once kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from jenny wingfield this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist the music is wonderfully simple accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene but never becoming intrusive the beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director freddie francis who was in his 70's when this was shot tess harper and sam waterston play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for 1957 caring strict and emotionally simple gail strickland is good also as the boy's mother there are feelings to sort out lessons to learn and truths to face in this sweet natured film that packs an emotional wallop to date this is robert mulligan's last film this is one of the very best films of 1991 of 4 stars
<START> this movie feels like a film project as though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with no experience and got to work characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though despite this amateurish feel the movie is effective it's like a cross section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or nurture their honest sexual feelings being raised by a grand parent of course from that generation there is shame associated with sexuality this provides for some predictable but well done conflict probably most enjoyable was the way the main character grew a little bit in his romantic relationship realizing a greater depth to sexual feelings a good watch but nothing stirring
<START> i loved this excellent movie farrah fawcett played the part phenomenally and with good heart she plays a woman who is driven to extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after she is attacked by a stranger after being rejected by the police she realizes she is on her own br br then one day when she at home alone the stranger breaks into her home and attacks her again not being about to call the police or get him out she is forced to spray him in the eyes and imprisons him in her fireplace br br i think there is a need for a wake up call to the laws of the land they are too easy on these criminals it's time for more harsh punishments
<START> i now that these days some people wan't see a movie without movie styling so much dogma lars von watchosky brothers are changed what we expect in a movie perhaps casomai is no one more independent non american movie the movie take all movies resources and language to tell us a simple history about love and marriage but much more fully of views lectures and let you thinking and i'm sure you can't fell boried any second of a long 116 minutes i calculate that don't have a single scene longer that 3 o 2 1 2 minutes
