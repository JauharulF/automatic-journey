<START> ok first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s i was shocked to find out it was released in 2001 secondly the plot was all over the place right off the bat the story is confusing had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better also i appreciate fantasy but this film was too much it was bizarre and badly filmed the scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd it was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand i love chinese epic films but if you're looking for a chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the promise visually stunning the plot is interesting and good character development not this film beware you will be disappointed
<START> keep in mind i'm a fan of the genre but have only recently seen this film for the first time how i've overlooked it all this time is a wonder to me to me this is a better film then the much lauded high noon it's a great western with excellent acting and a great story the dvd is in beautifull black and white with outstanding cinematography if you like westerns or james stewart this film is not to be missed
<START> the night evelyn came out of the grave emilio miraglia italy 1971 br br i only watched this delirious piece of euro tosh in the way of alpha video's dreadful dvd release looks like an extremely bad video transfer but from what i saw not nearly interesting enough to purchase no shame's recent dvd release considering their excellent track record it will undoubtedly be a major improvement over all previous releases and don't pay attention to the ridiculous cover shown here it's not taken from this film some girl holding the head of a jim carrey look a like br br spaghetti western star anthony steffen sports a hip hairdo and assumes the role of lord alan cunningham a man haunted by the memory of his dead wife evelyn this leads to a nervous breakdown which has him being retained in a psychiatric clinic once released cunningham channels this trauma by taking redheaded prostitutes to his countryside castle subjecting them to vicious acts of torture his doctor and friend richard timberlane what do you mean italian horror names sound made up advises him to forget the past and remarry but cunningham is obsessed with evelyn and even organizes a sÃ©ance at the castle eventually after killing some more girls he meets gladys another redhead and marries her almost immediately but the arrival of his new wife spawns a series of sinister events bloodthirsty creatures strike at sir alan's family killing them off one by one becoming more distraught cunningham visits evelyn's tomb and discovers it to be empty soon a number of outsiders begin to suspect something fishy is going on in the castle and lord cunningham's treatment might not have been that successful after all br br director emilio miraglia tries to blend gothic horror with giallo conventions with limited success as usual not the slightest effort was made to convince audiences the film is set in england the cars drive on the right side of the road everyone looks very mediterranean and the castle and the rest of the architecture is patently italian this is common practice in italian horror but sometimes they just take this a little too far the bad print made this even slightly bearable since it's so dark you couldn't see much of the surroundings anyway but then again this is the kind of film where anything can happen in the name of exploitation and depicting reality isn't really the issue a large part consists of sado masochistic torture scenes in the castle torture chamber but most of the time anthony steffen hams his way through this and shows some horrible over acting i guess it all depends on your state of mind and this can be a fun piece of nonsense if you're in the right mood i just couldn't take it at least not with the print i watched a pleasant score though by bruno nicolai which combines easy listening tunes with some psychedelic rock numbers br br camera obscura 4 10
<START> i really hate most end of the world movies they show what jaded hollywood people think of the rest of the world and they clearly think we're a bunch of sadistic idiots or at least that watching sadistic idiots react to things is somehow entertaining i've been to l a many times i have family that works in show business and i just want to say that these are the last people we should be looking to for a reality check some disaster movies at least paint a clever picture children of men 12 monkeys but usually the message is just people will do anything to survive all is dark and sad and purposeless we should all be ashamed of ourselves br br don't get me wrong i like the idea of a story that explores throwing off the system of social order and testing people's mettle in the face of horror and i do believe some people would act like this film portrayed but sadistic idiots aside i seriously doubt society would just dissolve into every man for himself that's just insulting
<START> ok i taped this off tv and missed the very start the film was about 10 or so seconds into the titles i assume so if anything happened before that i missed it br br lots of people say mark hammill is in this i didn't see him i did recognise clive barker john landis and obviously stephen king doing some really awful acting as the graveyard attendant br br alice krige looks lovely apart from the scenes where she has the cat face or is in full alien make up br br even with the opening titles it's never really explained very well exactly what sleepwalkers are or where they come from from the title sequence i assume they are catlike bipeds who live by extracting life force from humans i assume they live a long time and these particular 2 are possibly the last of their kind br br add to this a very large dose of incest yes i thought it was a bit suspect too shapeshifting killer cats and invisibility and you have sleepwalkers br br it's a very bad story that has no real explanations behind the main 2 characters and far too many cameo's to try and distract from the simple fact that not enough is explained to the viewer br br avoid
<START> nacho libre 2006 br br directed by jared hess br br starring jack black ana de la reguera hÃ©ctor jimÃ©nez darius rose br br mpaa rating pg 13 for some rough action and crude humor including dialog br br say what you will about it i know some people who despise it to no end but i have always thought that napoleon dynamite was a funny movie not the brightest brick on the wall but a funny movie nonetheless jack black is also a very funny man irritating at times yes and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him but funny there has rarely been a jack black comedy that i did not enjoy to some degree so i was very happy to hear that jared hess the writer and director of napoleon dynamite and jack black would be teaming up for a movie about a spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage my only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin unfortunately my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie this plot had it been done as a skit on some such show as saturday night live or possibly even mad tv would have worked flawlessly unfortunately the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one joke comedy falls flat br br nacho was raised in a mexican monastery and became a devout man of the lord feeling shunned by the entire monastery nacho black now the monastery's cook decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler as the monastery's finances hit an all time low nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage this plot sounds so sweet and caring it seems like the perfect movie for jack black look what he did with school of rock after all well to my displeasure this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie it is again hollywood's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humorÂof course for all i know maybe that is the general thought of teenagers as many seemed to enjoy this movie watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh but don't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie a seven year old could make up the same joke br br the performances in nacho libre are actually good jack black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic worthless lines in ever put on paper comical unfortunately this movie just wasn't enough for him it didn't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him i had never seen or heard of ana de la reguera before but now i can say that not only is she quite talented but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight she just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well hÃ©ctor jimÃ©nez who plays nacho's bumbling partner esqueleto kept me laughing continuously he did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of jack black's darius rose who plays an orphan named chancho didn't have many lines but what can i say i just enjoyed him he was adorable the rest of the cast did their job it is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub par movie br br nacho libre just does not work its plot is stretched far too thin the heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just don't work i very rarely laughed and if i did it was because of jack black or another member of the cast and that leads me to the bright side of nacho libre yes the cast this cast was justÂwell for lack of a better word they were on they all clicked had excellent chemistry together and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script after jared hess's napoleon dynamite kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie i was surprised to find myself so often bored with nacho libre something was lost here and i have yet to understand what it was all i know is that nacho libre is not a good movie and yet because of its cast it is completely worthless there is a small reason to watch if only to watch jack black work but if you are not a fan of jack black then avoid this movie like the plague i like black but i am done with this movie and with this review br br final thought yikes this is jared hess's surprisingly disappointing follow up to his hysterical napoleon dynamite br br overall rating 4 10 c
<START> the writers probably had no experience in the army and probably never glanced at a history book but i still give this cheaply produced war film some credit for taking a long needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war br br the action is confused and unbelievable any episode of combat has better production values but the cast is interesting seeing new york giant rosie greer was worth the buck i paid for this the art direction is fifth rate the men wear korean war uniforms and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the u s army reached germany in 1944 not sunny as they show here and i don't think the terrain resembled northern california the script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers there is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying springfield rifles instead of m 1s which second rate troops probably would have been issued with br br this basic story idea racist southern officer commanding black troops should have been expanded into a big budget production back then and its not too late to try it now you have to take this for what it is and i admire the creators of this film for making the effort br br i remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in italy which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944
<START> did anyone else feel as betrayed as i did the first hour or so was pretty solid but the last oh my god it seemed like it was predictable and cheesy not grandiose and epic like the entire run of the show has been most reviews have read have been glowing but i really can't understand why i had seriously predicted that general ending way earlier on but then retracted it because i thought no they would never do that that's far too lame i can hardly stand it i feel so unsatisfied i think i'm about to walk out the door to go sell every season i own someone please change my mind i want to love this so bad someone tell me why i'm wrong great show terrible ending
<START> in recent times i have been subjected to both this movie and king arthur on dvds chosen by others for an evening's entertainment and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion i have that the modern movie watching public totally lacks discrimination and is content as long as they get action both movies were utter rubbish br br whatever happened to character development whatever happened to meaningful dialogue whatever happened to acting and when watching something that vaguely purports to be historical whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy some realistic idea of the political map of the time even some slight flavour of the era especially in its social attitudes why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century america i have read on the message boards of disclaimers that little was known of the dark ages not so considerable amounts are known with much learned scholarship on the era but these jokers simply couldn't be bothered to do any homework br br i only wish i could vote 0 10
<START> a very high standard columbo story which was actually the first filmed episode of the long running series but was originally transmitted second after murder by the book br br robert culp makes his first of three appearances as the guest murderer in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency who blackmails the wife patricia crowley of a rich highly influential businessman played very sympathetically by ray milland after he falsifies a report in her favour after it is discovered she was having an affair the wife later rebels against the blackmail scheme but is killed in a fit of rage br br a very satisfying episode in many respects particularly as the plot is so strongly set up and subsequently developed and also because of the rare columbo ingredient that the crime is an unpremeditated killing the whole thing is further enhanced when the widowed husband uses the murderer to assist columbo in his investigations a feature that facilitates numerous good quality scenes particularly in the first sequence when the three central characters meet and columbo's crucially deceptive qualities are wonderfully in evidence br br directed with flair by bernard l kowalski and acted to an appropriately high level this really set the tone for whole series since murder by the book was let down by a poor ending the script by columbo creators richard levinson and william link is precise well structured and well thought out and is underpinned by a steady productive pace and meaningful sequences which really exhibit the unpredictability of the story ultimately the finale fittingly epitomises that columbo has always been one step ahead of the murderer br br overall this is a very fine piece of detective work for columbo and strongly suggests that the production team had worked positively and constructively to render a polished columbo story
<START> always enjoy great films which deal with the super natural and the deep thoughts of the spiritual world however this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction there is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell all i can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen the actors namely mark addy thomas garrett gave an outstanding performance in his native land england and we have seen him in still standing a tv series heath ledger played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in brokeback mountain '05 gave a great supporting role shannyn sossaman mara sinclair did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith don't waste your time you will be sorry
<START> stupid stupid stupid i can not stand ben stiller anymore how this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me i can't understand how this happens if i performed at work the way he acts in a movie i'd get fired and i own the company i would have to fire myself god this movie was just a plain steaming stinking pile of poo that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible something else i have to say the guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic what is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie i will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary
<START> mechenosets is one of the most beautiful romantic movies i've ever seen the name of the film can be translated in english as the sword bearer the main hero sasha was born with one exceptional ability he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword which emerges from under the skin in his hand at first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings but it is not about mechenosets he hardly can be even called the anti hero i think he is just a person who lost the purport in his life and faith in good justice and love in his life he has never met someone who could understand and love him except his mother every his step is stained with blood he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a damnation for him and suddenly he meets her she doesn't need the idle talks and explanations she loves him for what he is she doesn't care what he did the fact that he's next to her is more important than anything else but soon she finds out his secret he kills two people her ex boyfriend and his bodyguard to protect her before her very eyes even after that she couldn't escape her feelings they try to run but it's hart to hide finally they have a serious car accident he is caged she is in a mental hospital they don't know anything about each other but she believes that he'll save her he surmounts a lot of obstacles but finally finds her they run again but they aren't invulnerable she is wounded she needs a rest but police almost catch them he doesn't know what to do they drive into a corner and then his sword begins to cut down trees helicopter around them but there is no need for it because she is already dead in his arms and he is the lonely person in the whole world again
<START> man on fire tells a story of an ex special forces guy with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in mexico during the wave of kidnappings for ransom at first he's not to friendly but then they befriend with each other he decides to stop drinking etc etc then one day she gets kidnapped and killed br br and he won't stop at anything to get the revenge br br that's basically the story of man on fire but expect some big twists at least a few times including the ending which is beautiful and will probably make you cry br br that's also because of the great music harry gregson williams with lisa gerrard gladiator composed br br but the strongest part of the movie wait the thing is everything here is perfect br br first acting denzel washington is at his best mickey rourke and christopher walken good as always great radtha mitchell and amazing young dakota fanning and that's not the end of the list br br then come the cinematography which is dazzling and along with superb editing should have won an oscar for sure br br the story is not just a revenge movie the story is intelligent the story makes you think and is pure beautiful really br br this is one of those movies you need to see in your lifetime at least once
<START> there really isn't much to say about this movie it's crude but fun br br plot outline from imdb br br br br two losers from milwaukee coop remer parker stone invent a new game playing basketball using baseball rules when the game becomes a huge success they along with a billionaire's help form the professional baseketball league where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change cities coop remer's team the milwaukee beers is the only team standing in the way of major rule changes that the owner of the dallas felons vaughn wants to institute br br br br the acting is pretty good since there arn't many big stars in this movie although i am not a big fan of 'southpark' parker and stone do a pretty good job in their first real movie br br there are so many funny moments in this movie i can't come close to naming them all it never really lets up and they don't try to put some cruddy drama in to make it more serious br br and my favorite aspect of this movie the soundtrack it's great i especially like take me on and beer by reel big fish very underrated br br overall a crude but extremely funny movie 10 10 br br james black wolf johnston
<START> if one sits down to watch unhinged it is probably because its advertisements video boxes whatever scream that it was banned in the uk for over 20 years as virtually every video nasty does it's true exploitation and taboo excites people and draws them in with their promise of controversy being an exploitation fan however none of this was new to me the advertisements that scream that the film was banned in the uk don't necessarily make me want to watch it in fact the first thing that usually pops into my head is how disgustingly paranoid british censors are how i came to viewing this then is simple it promised gore and it was only 6 99 the price alone alerted me not to have any hopes of this being the next halloween but a cheap padding of your dvd collection never hurts i did force myself however to watch it all in one sitting because i find that deciding to save the rest for another day makes you even less inspired to finish it so anyway after 90 minutes of unhinged i found that i had come across the cheapest sleeping aid in existence i think the distributors could make a fortune if they simply changed their marketing technique br br the layout of unhinged is of any common slasher from the 80s there's unnecessary shower scenes and exploitative gore that's about it anyway it starts with a group of three attractive co eds crashing their car on the way to a concert though two of them terry and nancy are okay one gloria is severely injured and is out of commission for the rest of the movie they are rescued and receive shelter at a mansion that happens to have no phone of course with rather strange occupants marion is a middle aged woman with a man hating mother who constantly accuses marion of sneaking men into the house in order to sleep with them echoes of psycho she also happens to have a crazy brother carl who lives in the woods because her mother's hatred for men is so intense that she refuses to let him stay in the house after hanging with marion for awhile terry our hero and nancy decide they must contact their parents despite everyone's warnings nancy braves the dangerous woods to make it to a phone her fate is not hard to predict after that we see gloria again who is then promptly butchered with an ax when terry discovers that gloria has disappeared from her room she decides something isn't right with this picture and sets out to find her missing friends that may be easier said than done however with crazy carl lurking aroundÂ br br after viewing unhinged i read an overwhelming number of reviews declaring that unhinged worked perfectly because it took its time to build its subject matter that created real tension by the time the moment of truth comes at the end normally i do not drag other people's opinions into my reviews especially when they contradict my views but in this case i was so puzzled by their reactions that i thought it would be relevant to mention this is because in actuality the film crawls normally for the slow building tactic to work the audience must have a strong sense that the characters are in danger oh sure we see two of them get murdered but between that are endless scenes of conversation and boredom we are aware that there's a killer on the loose but this is only focused on three times in the film that means there's no reason to fear for the victims instead the film's events are explained not by the actions of the characters but are drawn out for us by perpetual talking if there's one thing i can assure you from watching this it's that scenes of characters merely conversing with each other for 75 minutes are very tedious none of this is helped by the atrocious acting it seems that this was another case of the director needing actors and decided to gather his friends around instead of finding anyone with experience br br of course i'd be a liar if i said there wasn't one part of the movie that i enjoyed specifically the ending was one of the best i've ever seen in a slasher film you just do not expect that to happen just knowing that the director had the balls to do something like that is spectacular ah i won't spoil it for you nor will i say that the ending completely makes up for the rest of the slow moving film but it definitely will get your attention other than that the other two murder scenes bring at least some faster paced material but it's not like you couldn't tell exactly who was going to die fifteen minutes into the film anyone looking for a bloodbath will be disappointed however those are the only scenes of gore present that and of course no one scene can save an entire movie i normally preach the doctrine that as long as there's action the worse a movie is the better it gets unhinged only grasps one part of this concept the whole film just feels luke warm there's potential alright but the director either wasn't experienced enough to make it work or just didn't know what the hell he was doing
<START> have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own with one of your closest friends at your side facing all sorts of dangers and villains and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization that's just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets even if you're not quite that much of a fantasy lover have you ever wished you could simply experience what it's like to be a kid again and not have a care in the world for just a couple of hours br br this is exactly what miyazaki's castle in the sky is all about pazu a young but very brave and ambitious engineer lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day a girl named sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail simply put it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another and i can't help but feel my worries melt away every time i see it br br as it is one of miyazaki's older works and takes much place in the everyday world the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as spirited away howl's moving castle or even princess mononoke still i find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other because all three of those films are at some point or another mystical to the point of being enigmatic if not perplexing especially for the youngest of viewers br br castle in the sky on the other hand doesn't try so much to be an allegory of any kind and it's not a coming of age story either it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a child's mind i've ever seen not only is the artwork beautiful but the use of perspective from the kids' eyes is just amazing whether it's the panning up of the camera to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air i just can't help but feel like i'm there with pazu and sheeta just a kid in another world far far away from reality br br even the kids themselves don't have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like ashitaka san or chihiro haku sheeta is pazu's angel having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start as the film progresses more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions not only are they an adorable reminder of who i used to be but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film only growing stronger all the way to the last frame for that reason i've fallen in love with the two of them more than i have with any other miyazaki couple br br at the same time castle in the sky is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be you'll be sure to find your fix here mystery action drama comedy suspense sci fi romance even some western it's all here just about everything people go to the movies for except maybe horror this why i can easily recommend it as a first miyazaki film it's perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works br br even the ending song of the film when translated into english conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization and some kind of soul mate that could not be found in our mundane lives the reason i long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them the earth spins carrying you carrying us both who'll surely meet miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of joe hiasashi's gorgeous scores but this is the only one i've seen that's both a touching love song and an inspirational dream i have found myself near tears just listening to it br br castle in the sky may not be miyazaki's most developed spectacular or meaningful work but it's absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be a true vision of childhood fantasy and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids sit back relax and love it for what it is
<START> while hollywood got sort of stagnant during the few years after wwii england developed a very prolific film industry in the man in the white suit inventor sidney stratton alec guinness creates a suit that never gets dirty unfortunately this means that certain other businesses are now likely to go out of business how can sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity this is an example of one of the great movies in which alec guinness starred before he became obi wan kenobi it's a good look at the overall absurdity of the business world if you're planning to start any kind of business you might want to consider watching this movie
<START> i'll be honest this is one of the worst movies ever if not then it's very close ever seen a bad teen soap opera well this is like one of those except worse for example possibly spoiler girl i wanna go somewhere else br br guy all we need is here br br girl but i wanna take myself somewhere different br br guy i'll take you somewhere else br br proceeding this line they have sex the music is bad pop and bad punk rock if you've ever read the book avoid this movie like the plague they completely change the personalities of the characters and the events additionally they just get rid of things also the movie ends about before the book finishes it is an awful movie so if you haven't read the book don't watch it if you have read the book burn it the movie if you like stupid teen soap operas that are lower quality than your average low quality teen soap opera go for it then again should we expect anything different from mtv
<START> this movie is great mind you but only in the way it tells a very bad story stella is so terribly crude and never learns better her husband is incredibly snobby and small minded neither ever learns better is this realistic somehow stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners dress yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down i don't think so stella is a good woman and a very good mother giving up herself so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting br br much of what we see might have been normal for the times people having a beer or two enjoying a player piano dancing but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority i can't have our child living this way spare me br br this story tells me one thing that the unwashed working class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes and that is simply a load of hogwash
