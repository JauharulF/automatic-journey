<START> many people like this movie and many more love it but it seems that it is all for the wrong reasons scarface should be liked and loved but not in the way it has been or is br br many people say the acting was over the top but who better to do an over the top character than al pacino to say that pacino went over the top in here would be an understatement yet he does it so well he just brings the inner devil out of you so well his character tony montana was not such a great guy to begin with but his thirst for power just bring his sickness of greed to another level an inhumane level sure at times pacino seems to be a bit cartoonish and surreal but that does not at all to me seem to be a liability at all the supporting cast served its job very well michelle pfeiffer was not really at her best but she certainly fit the role she played on the other hand steven bauer was at his best still he is steven bauer mary elizabeth mastrantonio was good and like michelle pfeiffer fit her role very well robert loggia i have always enjoyed watching in just seeing him yell other than pacino they were not really any standout or memorable performances everybody just seemed to fit their roles by being there they did not fit in perfectly but were convincing enough br br brian de palma did a very good job directing this movie whenever an actor is able to become larger than life with his performance some credit should be given to the director and i will certainly give de palma that brian de palma though not given the respect is a very versatile director by my count he knows how to direct movies according to their genres but that at times has not turned out well in here it does this is by all counts a gangster movie but few are much better than this one because of de palma br br the writing was great it was just pure oliver stone when i saw the credits at the end of this movie and saw that oliver stone had written this i was not the least bit surprised that is a testament to him though i have always though of him as a great writer and to me he proves this once again with scarface nobody knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie than oliver stone br br the music was good but not that great it is certainly not my favorite from giorgio moroder the music was a little bit too 80s ish for me but it didn't annoy me the cinematography was good not amazing but really who cares with a movie like this br br this has probably been one of the most influential movies in the past 25 years but as mentioned before it is for the wrong reasons people should realize that the character of tony montana is no hero he is a monster he is not inspiring in anyway he is greedy bloodthirsty uneducated and self consumed yet he is a role model to many people because he is in some way or another a rebel but probably most of all because he is a deluded gangster a vigilante would be like mother tereasa next to scarface br br the good thing about this movie though is that it shows that the tony montanas' are not the real problem if we or the people of authority would want to shut people like him down we could do it but we don't in a freaky twisted way he is a necessity of our society he is somebody you could blame everything on and fell better about yourself doing it the tony montanas' of this world are the scapegoats of our society this in no way excuses people like him instead it is more of a reminder that we shouldn't excuse or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we measure up or think we measure up compared better to a gangster or drug dealer i love this movie because it is more than a corruption movie it is a movie that in a strange way makes you self reflect

<START> i can't believe how many people hate hal sparks he was my favorite host of the show hands down i hate celebrity gossip and generally dislike talk shows but when hal sparks hosted talk soup it was must see tv for me i rarely missed an episode during his run and was saddened when the guest hosts started pouring in although most of the guests still did a fine job br br anyway for all the people who dislike hal sparks i imagine they must have never seen the weekend specials they were hour long episodes of talk soup that comprised the best clips from the entire week and were padded out by sketch comedy bits the original bits that hal sparks did were hilarious in one he got possessed by a bad comedy demon and in an exorcist like scene his head spun as he told dated jokes about airline food one episode was dedicated to making fun of multiplicity as a bunch of cloned hal sparks kept multiplying through out the episode over running the studio br br ok maybe these don't sound as funny when i describe them but all i know is that besides talk soup the only other two shows i watched consistently during those years was the simpsons and late night with conan o'brian so if you like the comedy stylings of those shows then you'd probably like talk soup during the sparks years br br that said henson and tyler were both great hosts as well all three hosts brought something different to the table but they were all fine comedians in my opinion of course throughout the tyler and guest star years my interest in this show began to wane but every now and then i catch the soup the show's spiritual successor and sure enough the new host can bring some pretty unexpected laughs from time to time br br ok i've wasted enough time talking about a tv show that isn't on the air anymore and on a channel that i generally despise go watch something else
<START> no just kidding it was god awful br br i was watching my local sci fi station last night which plays movies every night within a monthly theme this month it's space turkeys or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bombs movies so bad they should never have been made this was a good selection br br everything about this movie is thoroughly horrible with two exceptions the gore make up which showed potential and the editing which slightly out did the rest of the movie in terms of being horrible the acting is horrible all around the dialog is horrible the script the direction it's not a good movie br br it consists of two forms of special effects gore and stock footage of space i'll focus on the gore watching this movie i thought to myself what was the motivation behind the making of this movie people like making stuff sure but i was hesitant to think anything good could have come of it for anyone involved i came to the conclusion that this movie was made as a means to increase the make up effects guy's demo reel he rick baker actually went on to a pretty nice career he's worked on star wars 1977 king kong 1976 men in black 1996 and even the incredible shrinking woman 1981 plus a number of other notable flicks other than that i can't say i've ever actually seen a real live melting man incredible or otherwise but i'd have to say this seemed to be a fair representation of one br br now when i think of bad editing i usually think of maybe a scene where someone's talking on the phone and then in the middle of the scene the phone jumps down to his shoulder or something to that effect this movie really serves to highlighted the fact that bad editing can take many forms specifically over long and utterly useless scenes just about every scene dragged on longer than it should have from a little bit of dead air to that crazy long screaming scene with cleaver girl and that severed head in the river the head gets thrown into a river in slow motion the movie carries on for a couple minutes and then we cut back to the floating head and watch it fall down a waterfall while i'm sure they were all very proud of their severed head what the hell br br lastly i'll mention the running fat lady slow motion scene right near the beginning the jerky slow motion tells me that they didn't shoot the scene in slow motion originally but later decided that it wasn't working like that and then slowed it down oy vey in any event if you should ever see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hall and then directly through a closed glass door all in slow motion mind you remember the incredible melting man for this is where it all started br br movies like this are best viewed at home with a bunch of friends this one's a little slow most of the time but that's just all the more time to come up with your own one liners it's not the worst of the worst but it's pretty freaking bad
<START> kate beckinsale steals the show bravo too bad knightly ins't as good looking as jeremy northam mark strong did a fabulous job bernard hepton was perfect as emmas father i love the end scene which is an addition to the novel but well written when the harvest is in and knightly dines with his workers and high society friends emma must show that she accepts this now she is a changed woman that is too much too quick but ok i'll buy into it samantha bond plays emma's ex governess and confidant she is wonderful just as i would have imagined her i believe that when the uk does a jane austen its the best american versions of english literature are done for money and not for quality see this one
<START> i was skeptical when i first saw the calvin kline esque commercials but thought i'd give it a chance so i've watched it and all i can say is bleh this movie was so bad it's rare that i hate a movie this much watching this flick reminded me of those funny scenes in altman's the player when the writers pitch their bizarre ideas to producers i'd like to know which mtv producer decided that an hour and a half long music video adaptation of bronte but this time heathcliff's name is heath and he's a rock star and hindley's name is hendrix would be a good idea br br even that might not have been so bad had they not gotten every other aspect of the film so horrible wrong as well the direction must have been you're lonely pout for me i laughed out loud during all the serious scenes and was bored throughout the rest the camera work was jagged and repeatedly reminded me that i was watching a bad movie trying to be edgy my theory is that the sound guy got bored and went down to the beach for a few beers with his boom all i could hear in half the scenes were the waves and in the other scenes i wish that's all i could hear and speaking of sound what they did to the sisters of mercy song more is absolutely inexcusable then again it's inexcusable what they did to bronte br br on the bright side there was one entertaining scene specifically the moment when johnny whitworth licked katherine heigl's face and if you can tell me what that scene had to do with all the rest of the story more power to you
<START> this movie is not funny it just takes the d d nerd stereotypes and amplifies them all the main characters make less than 30k a year they all live with their parents they're all socially retarded and they have no luck with women the jokes are horrible and unimaginative such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a kkk looking hood on it was his wizard costume and the other guy had on a john rocker warm up oh how funny he's a nerd so he doesn't know about sports you may have to be a childish high schooler to find any of this stuff funny poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch but obviously extremely cheap to make i feel sorry for kelly lebrock and beverly d'angelo i guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime
<START> luckily i did not pay to see this movie also i cannot even reveal any spoilers because i willingly walked out after forty minutes of the movie it was that bad i laughed once when the yahoo billboard fell on the guy and the theme song came on however that was only because i thought it was making fun of it but then i realized it was yet another product placement br br i loved the cartoon i used to watch it almost religiously although i missed the last episode i heard that they show dr claw and it was nothing more than a claw somebody comment on the show's page the cartoon had penny and brain alot more than the movie had as to that point i hated the setup of the whole thing reminiscent of robocop then broderick screws with the whole feeling of inspector gadget he is not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon was another fact is his gadgets actually work to the point i saw except for the oil slick he also screwed with the tone of wowsers which used to be in an excited tone i felt so disappointed that they slaughtered the cartoon so badly everybody else felt that way too us 14 17 year olds remember the cartoon fondly and we loved every minute of it br br i went into the movie with an open mind knowing that they would have screwed with the cartoon i was taken aback at how retarded the movie was it relied on sight gags and stupid dialogue for humor disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a kids movie along product placement is pointless in this film and it shows the wise cracking car is not that good at cracking wise the gadgets look nice but they were almost overly glossy the cartoon was a better look the silly scenes were crap in the 40 45 minutes i watched the movie not one laugh was heard and they laughed at the dudley do right preview this movie should not be watched by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment i highly recommend the iron giant which was sad but very very good this movie is a travesty to the whole family drama 1
<START> a cannibalistic backwoods killer is on the prowl and two bickering couples might be his next source of protein in this bargain basement friday the 13th clone cheapie there s literally nothing of interest to see in this one the killings are surprisingly sparse and when they do happen completely amateurish it also adds ghosts into the mix for no reason what so ever i felt drained after watching it as if my brain was liquefying and draining out my nose and it remains without a doubt donald jones' worst movie if you're thinking of renting it because of code red's snazzy new dvd re release don't bother br br my grade f
<START> as i said in my comment about the first part these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess br br the scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization but the aftermath thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans protected by only one powerful spaceship br br but when battlestar pegasus appears the story heats up carrying the battle back to the cylon planets okay it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant earth but it works for me it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects even though those tend to repeat themselves to say the least br br i would have loved a continuation with starbuck and apollo on board instead we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well chosen br br so thumbs down for the productions of 1980 but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978
<START> a group of friends come face to face with a family of hideous cannibals whilst camping in the beautiful german countryside br br the 'mutant cannibal family' concept is almost as old as the hills that the inbred freaks often call home so any director attempting to breath new life into the genre needs to come up with something pretty darn special in order to impress with barricade timo rose tries to give the well worn routine a teutonic twist by transplanting the action to the black forest and giving it the german low budget splatter treatment the result is a very bloody but totally unoriginal effort that is made almost unwatchable thanks to some dreadful directorial decisionsÂin particular the non stop use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques br br had timo rose not opted to utilise every naff trick his editing software offered him then barricade might have been a reasonably entertaining gore fest his inexperienced cast do reasonably well the bloody effects are suitably stomach churning and there are one or two scares and even some well conceived creepy moments all of this however is completely ruined by the awful camera work choppy editing and overwhelming barrage of visual gimmickry used to give the film the distressed look that is so inexplicably popular with today's film makers br br i give barricade 3 out of 10 purely for the outlandish gore which includes a nifty scene where a guy is forced to drink acid loads of nasty wounds caused by a variety of sharp implements and some pretty decent shotgun damage
<START> i watched this movie as i liked the plot a group of strangers are held captive trying to figure out how they're connected br br the setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first and best saw movie although there wasn't much action the story moved at a relatively good pace br br there was comedy relief ion the form of the two bickering 'alpha males' and it was a welcome surprise for me anyway to see melissa joan hart hasn't given up on acting yet br br a few things let it down for me personally 1 the paedophile was way over characterised making him get turned on by everything from children to dead bodies br br 2 mjh's line about her cop ex 'getting her into this' when in reality he was the least deserving person to be there he hadn't knowingly contributed to the events leading up to their capture br br 3 the ending what sort of movie just ends in the middle of something going on there was no resolution no cliff hanger no obvious end it just ends br br and for that alone i dropped two stars off my rating the first 2 points i would let slide but not the end
<START> i don't quite get the rating for the amati girls and i think i was really kind giving it a 4 out of 10 what could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes there are so many clichÃ©s in that flick the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake there's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over acting over any limits that it hurts it's not funny enough to be a comedy it's too fake sad to really touch so in my eyes it's just not good watching it i couldn't believe how something like that made it to my tv set in my living room in switzerland but maybe it still was ok and it just got lost in translation who knows definitely one of the oddest movies i've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way sorry
<START> an original uncensored print of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 in the library of congress and has been shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005 according to current reviews that i've found online the original has all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos intact they were later either removed or completely re shot by the studio prior to initial release in order to pass the new york state censors i have also read that a dvd is expected in 2006 and one can only hope if we're really luckily it will include comparisons between the 2 versions note that the released censored version was originally available on laserdisc which i have seen stanwyck rules
<START> i have seen some pretty bad movies and this is right up there no plot to speak of it's like one of those bad coma episodes on a soap opera i just wanted to smack that little girl because well lets just say she's real suspicious all the way through the movie the monsters running around wearing some bling was funny i also saw a bit of silent hill in there and i read that this was done by and or stared a finnish metal band lordi so it's no wonder that it didn't make much sense it seem to be a vehicle for promoting there band and nothing more the fx are very good the look of the movie the monsters and even the acting also good but the story and the telling of it just aren't there
<START> there are so many goofy things about this movie that i can't possibly name but a few br br bogart's character 1 his name Â whip mccord too easy so i'll leave it at that boy it makes humphrey' sound good 2 his long curly hair and silly sideburns 3 his black bart get up complete with spurs 4 not sure what shade of lipgloss they've got him wearing but it ain't none too flattering br br cagney's character jim kincaid 1 his lipstick doesn't do him any favors either 2 the man is being swallowed by his hat during the entire film could they not find a hat to fit him even a little 3 his pants are too tight in the rear 4 he blows the smoke off his gun one too many times if you know what i mean and i think you do br br if you are a casual bogart or cagney fan and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a western do yourself a favor and forget that thought even the horses look embarrassed that is when they don't look bored br br in all fairness i admit that westerns are my least favorite film genre but i've still seen much much better than this br br on a comedy level or as high camp the oklahoma kid works otherwise it's viewer beware therefore see this only if a you must see every western out there b you are a true cagney or bogie completist c any of the above comments appeal to you woahÂ
<START> angela johnson pamela springsteen yes she's related to bruce the killer from the first film is up to her old tricks again she's one of the counselors at camp rolling hills as long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex drugs and swearing things are fine but a few step over the line and angela kills them cracking bad jokes all the way br br the original sleepaway camp was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it this is vicious and nasty too but has no good points to it the plot has been done to death and this adds nothing new to the formula there are plenty of gory killings in here people are burnt alive heads are cut off throats slashed but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical this also has the smallest amount of campers i've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles especially higgins as expected there's the gratuitous female nudity here provided by the tremendously untalented valerie hartman and the obligatory good girl good boy team renne estevez and tony higgins with the sole exception of springsteen and higgins the acting is lousy even by slasher movie standards there's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse boring and sick with a stupid plot pointless nudity and bad gore skip it
<START> if somebody wants to make a really really bad movie wizards of the lost kingdom really sets a yardstick by which to measure the depth of badness br br start with the pseudo chewbacca that follows around the main character some poor schmuck in a baggy white furry costume that looks as if it was stitched together from discarded pieces of carpeting work your way slowly painfully through more not so special effects that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief add a garden gnome just for the heck of it br br on second thought skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half
<START> so i'm looking to rent a dvd and i come across this movie called 'end game' it stars james woods and cuba gooding jr and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller well worth a look then or so i thought br br boy was i wrong br br end game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the displeasure of enduring now being something of a whodunnit i can't really tear into it as i would like without 'ruining' it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity but questions such as 'why has he she they done this ' and 'where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off ' are all too abundant following the film's unintentionally hilarious conclusion br br as for the acting you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor's realised that they've made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie and this then shows in their performance this is one of those accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison br br of course this didn't make it to the cinema and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room it is appalling
<START> chances are you'll think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it but if by chance you watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time i'm well into the hundreds by now you will find yourself spitting a line from it here and there and cracking yourself up my friends and i have actually thrown fear of a black hat parties to get more of our friends as they say down with the riots
