<START> this movie wants to elaborate that criminals are a product of modern society therefore can thieves rapists and murderers the killer of this movie carl panzram james woods is all three and worse be held fully accountable for their deeds an interesting notion but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way and this is where killer a journal of murder falls very short although the film tries to put panzram's behaviour into perspective with flashbacks to his violent youth and dysfunctional upbringing the viewer never gets the idea that panzram is a victim rather than a culprit sure the system is corrupt with one mobster occupying the whole sick bay of leavenworth prison where most of the movie takes place most prison guards are sadistic bullies and the prison director something like a megalomaniacal despot but why on earth does new prison guard henry lesser robert sean leonard take such pity on panzram even after having read his gruesome diaries the movie offers some explanation lesser witnesses panzram being beaten to a pulp by the most sadistic and stereotypical guard and is impressed by panzram's intelligence though it isn't clear why exactly lesser thinks this man is so smart surely this isn't enough to sympathize with a hostile man like panzram even though this movie tends to downplay his crimes and highlight his personality towards lesser panzram is quite loyal and the viewer is given the impression that for lesser this outweighs all of the atrocities he has read about in panzram's diaries does this man lesser have so little friends that he takes at face value everyone who seems only remotely friendly to him perhaps it is lesser who is a product of modern society judging on appearance rather than substance br br i can advise monster starring charlize theron and christina ricci as a movie which handles roughly the same themes with far more integrity and scope br br btw killer looks as though shot for tv not so good
<START> i really like this movie i can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it i suppose that is one of my criteria for a great movie br br the story is very interesting it introduces us to 6 characters each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other the dying master sends the 6th venom his last student to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committed br br how will the last pupil find the other venoms how will he know which of them is bad the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great br br we also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination it is fun to see how their styles match up against each other br br if you want to see if you like kung fu movies this is a good movie to start with it doesn't get any better than this
<START> why did i enjoy the show to the last episode because of the true talent melissa joan hart and her supporting cast had of demonstrating that whit comedy light hearted humor and deep thought could actually coexist what i enjoyed most was the fact that i could come home from a hard day's work and bust a smile i was inspired and why it was an inspiration to watch as this magical person was so happy while helping others br br sabrina was a hero in my opinion even though she was vulnerable in ways that were not so different from our own to very different she had powers at her fingertip wishes and command that could be used for good or bad which may only exist in many of our imaginations most everything we see have know about own or even desire can be used for good or bad and how we choose to define that defines the person we are br br she traveled the globe and other realms with these constant and unwaivering ideas in mind to learn to live to laugh and to love she was always learning how to improve her skills to the benefit of all around her she made mistakes as she was living life going through different journey's of growth as she her aunts and salem the underrated yet imperfect hero did well to demonstrate that even through mistakes you can still be noble gifted and wonderful br br she also demonstrated many selfless learning and loving acts as she went along her way if this isn't reason enough for 10 stars in this war torn world where people are so hostile toward each other not realizing how differences are the spice of life rather than a reason to kill then i don't know what is this show was most certainly a trip to a better world as well as an inspiration to be better ourselves and a gift intended to bust a smile on our chops i've heard from a doctor before that everything that i've mentioned above leads to a healthy hart and isn't that what we all need
<START> don't know if this contains any spoilers or not but i don't want to risk being blacklisted until the year 3462 br br i disagree entirely with the viewer comments that have described guns germs and steel as politically correct and neo marxist they cannot have watched the same series that i did br br the series i watched depicted the history of european colonisation in the americas and southern africa with no particular inaccuracies i saw nothing in the series that portrayed europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky though europeans often were lucky and there's nothing wrong with luck neither did i see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things if anything the inca was rather arrogant as you would expect any leader would be when dealing with foreigners if his country has not been conquered in living memory by any other world power br br i certainly saw nothing that could be construed as marxist or neo marxist except by the most incredibly elastic of imaginations br br otherwise many african peoples do have a built in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that europeans lack at the time they were at the height of their successes the aztec maya and inca civilisations were as advanced as any other in the world and as wealthy sometimes more so aboriginal american and khoi san populations were decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by europeans just as european colonists were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria note the khoi san peoples are completely different from all other sub saharan african peoples br br so i don't see what some of the other commentators are complaining about the only thing i can find to complain about is that the series doesn't tell me anything i did not know by the time i finished seventh grade there's really nothing new in the way of historical information in this film it does however present some nice dramatisations of events such as the conquest of the incas the production values are very high and it fills in a few holes here and there that didn't get covered in mrs gruber's sixth hour social studies class at milan middle school br br if you rent or buy this assuming you had a decent primary and or secondary school education you won't learn anything new but you will have an enjoyable and entertaining time reviewing what you already learned or should have learned by the time you hit high school
<START> wow the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of houses 40 years ago i'll preface by saying i'm not a fan of narrated episodes if the story actors etc are worth their salt they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative without having to read it out reminded me of personages who can't think off the cuff but rely on teleprompters the psychobabble was tedious and boring but some enjoy that kind of thing it's just not my cup o tea they could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it was coming from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something niggling little things like peugeot being at the house which has a singular half circle driveway yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree he was standing under because it's nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property sloppy editing as she pulls into the driveway for what seems the 100th time exactly who are those 2 guys you see at 24m30s walking towards the car as she pulls into the driveway of the deserted house the dolly close ups were also overdone like some jr high drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time i could keep picking apart but that might get almost as boring as this episode was it kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage they had shot of elaine driving the newport convertible i fully expected to see the chrysler logo and a nice jingle play while a voice over told us all about the 8 track player automatic top etc the only good thing i have to say about his one is that it just ends abruptly no loose ends tied up nothing explained or terminated not that many would notice i suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end
<START> i first saw this as a child living in east london the scars of hitlers luftwaffe were all too evident and the landscape of the movie was reminiscent of our street i remember having nightmares after seeing it the odd thing is it really hasn't dated if viewed as a piece of social history in cinema fiction br br apart from a globally destructive war the scale of the machines was badly awry more nano technology now but overall an excellent and well crafted work it was interesting to see how space travel was perceived back then i would think that firing a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts however much was right mans desire for war mans inhumanity to man the means of war as a catalyst for development br br
<START> this was a pretty good film i'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment but i didn't want to take a chance anyway near the end of the film the prosecutor reads a scripture verse and then quotes another from memory i can't remember the first passage he reads but the second one is genesis 9 6 he says it's genesis 9 12 but he actually quotes verse 6 this is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment it's too bad that prosecutors dare not quote the bible today did anybody ever hear of john jay the first supreme court justice in the history of this country he said that the bible is the best of all books too bad we've lost that view in america
<START> i was at this film's premiere at the toronto film festival in 1997 after the screening when the writer director and some cast members offered to answer questions no one could even be bothered to ask any rarely has a film been so poorly directed why on earth were random frames snipped out of some scenes wretchedly acted david arquette to paraphrase dorothy parker does not run the emotional gamut from a to b he parks at a and brings a lunch and utterly pointless characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions at long last the film comes to a completely random and pointless end that's supposed to really make you think unfortunately what it makes you think is well there's 90 minutes of my life i'm never getting back
<START> just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinion and justice to the movie br br first of all to get things straight this movie is not pretending to be anything other than a solid action comedy movie it doesn't aim to revolutionize the movie industry and garner critical acclaims nor does it want to be regarded as one if you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest i suggest you discard your critical mindedness and your longing for a good plot because you won't find any in here with that established let us further into the movie br br i had low expectations for this movie simply because it didn't have a strong plot yes moviegoers i underrated this movie as well but i never expected myself to enjoy this movie that much i even enjoyed this more than the stephen chow flicks which i find kung fu hustle to be his best effort and would've rated it a 9 as well action is tight and epic while comedy chokes on to the right places br br spoilers alert i think the action might be unreal but why would i want to watch a serious basketball movie anyways there are a lot other sports movies drama that already did it well why create another spoilers end br br i'm not even sure why you're reading this go ahead and watch it just remember no thinking just watch enjoy smile laugh and br br every once in a while they the movie industry creates masterpieces such as pulp fiction or the godfather movies and sometimes they create movies which are better off in the pile of dump i'm not saying kung fu dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples have then again if we're talking about stephen chow ish comedy this one's a top ten br br highly recommended if you love no brainer movies with really good action kung fu death trance kung fu and comedy what the heck watch this you'll have a great time br br 9 10 for you the cast of kung fu dunk
<START> though i liked on the town better i really liked it i'm a new comer when it comes to frank sinatra and gene kelly though i had heard of them i had never seen anything with them in it until recently the first one i saw was singin in the rain that made me a fan of gene's i think that is better too but i thought that this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book it's an awesome movie and i love it frank and gene make a good team i have yet to see them together in take me out to the ballgame but i'm sticking to my guns bu saying that i really enjoyed it and that i love it
<START> what a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject there is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight or gay man working in a gay sexual environment the dancers keep talking about their art as if it has no erotic component they may not all be prostitutes for hire but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered from the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then end up hiring the dancers for private sessions even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the dancers only playing to the women in the audience this just isn't the reality of these clubs it would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples so what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients we learn very little instead we get filler a gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers a manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag acts but offers no insight into the dancers' lives and attitudes br br the pictures of mexico city are generic the phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous br br this is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing the rest of the movie is an insult to gay men
<START> the reason i intended to give this movie a chance to take 2 hours of my life actually it was only 35 minutes was my wish to try to understand and hopefully appreciate indian cinema all i have ever seen were few older movies of s ray br br browsing through imdb i came across this one and after seeing rating of 8 7 i concluded this must be the one which will open the doors of unknown and bring artistic enjoyment oh my how wrong i was the only logical explanation for this rating of 8 7 is that most of 970 people who voted are indian and their only venture outside bolliwood production were adam sandler movies br br with this rating this movie would be ranked on 9th place on imdb list of 250 best movies above citizen cane goodfellas of psycho i am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that i find worth remembering from this painful experience my only hope is that there is a lot of hindu who like me find this movie as is plain stupid with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music
<START> one of the less widely lauded of recent asian period action affairs gojoe is an at first slow and often curious but overall pretty terrific offering exciting layered and beautiful i'm sad to say i know virtually nothing of the buddhist philosophy or japanese history and legend that surrounds this film so its deeper meanings are lost on me but even without contextual knowledge this is still rich fare taking a traditional fantasy structure into a impactful higher plane the story is of benkei a warrior monk and perhaps demon who seeks enlightenment by destroying the demon of gojoe bridge prince shanao himself a mortal seeker after his own higher plane but this time the power of demons thus the film becomes a matter of illusions and in benkei's case indecision a conflict in which the real goal is self knowledge for benkei to come to terms with his true nature and for prince shanao to come face to face with the nature of what he seeks to become benkei is even more hampered here by the fact that his dark nature makes him fundamentally at odds with the world even when not in open conflict he is never at ease director sogo ishii handles this one as an epic with measured pace camera work always stylish and often frenzied without neglecting the need for more sedate moments to let the location sink in there is also great use of lighting and fog to give an ethereal atmosphere there is an air of fantasy to much of the film but outside of the overtly supernatural moments it is a down and dirty fantasy with more period fell than flights of fancy the cinematography of makoto watanbe is important here vivid and detailed a richly evocative affair actingwise daisuke ryu is dignified and powerful with a mysterious savagery as benkei while tadanobu asano has a driven cold arrogance as prince shanao of the leads masatoshi nagase rounds things out as an ordinary man smart and cynical but still unaware of just exactly what the stakes are the film all fits together well it is however a touch flabby at times it begins slowly some shots are a little drawn out and the epic fight scenes at times go on longer than strictly necessary as for the fighting it is filmed frenetic rather than for actual moves it has artistic impact but may disappoint regular action fans often obscured by objects flashing blades and fast moving individuals whirling with deadly force through their adversaries are the order of the day it is invigorating to watch but in the end i could have done with a little more traditionalism there is some unfortunate cgi bloodshed as well it somewhat works in the context but is still distracting overall though i found this to be a pretty great film its not one for regular action fans or swordplay enthusiasts seeking another azumi rather a deeper and more mystical beast its ending in particular will not go down well with fans of the more generic wing of such fare but as for myself it really hit the spot and for those more adventurously inclined it might do so too well recommended at any rate
<START> this is on my top list of all time favourite films it is a fantastic and insightful film it was historically interesting and great to watch i thought the acting from emily blunt was fantastic and rupert friend was a fantastic albert the best actor was chosen for albert the costumes were gorgeous and the settings and scenes such as the opera house were amazing and detailed i just loved it all of it i loved the childhood scenes were she's getting 'bullied' by john conroy and where her mother says she has to walk stairs with an adult one again the writers have done it they produced this fantastic script br br it thoroughly deserves the awards they got oscar and bafta wining sandy powell for costume design a bafta for best make up and hair an oscar in best achievement in art direction best achievement in costume design best achievement in makeup broadcast film critics association awards for best costume design also nominated for best actress emily blunt cdg for excellence in costume design for film period hampton's international film awards for an audience award for best narrative film pfcs for best costume design sudbury cinefest doesn't say what for vfcc for best actress emily blunt overall 10 wins and 11 nominations that pretty good http www imdb com title tt0962736 awards have a look yourself its really interesting personally rupert friend should have got an award
<START> i never really knew who robert wuhl was before seeing this but after seeing it i realized what a funny man he is this hbo special features him teaching american history to new york university film students and the man was just phenomenal he poked fun at almost every key historic event that occurred not just in the u s but some other parts of the world this documentary comedy was a great satire that made me question if what i accept as the infallible true history is really true br br i enjoyed how mr wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning a lot more exciting i would recommend this to anyone interested in history and is willing to question what his her beliefs
<START> i just rented this movie to see dolph lundgren whom i hadn't seen in any movies since rocky iv unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment the acting of all the parties was bad except for mr lundgren who was okay ish kata dobÃ³ was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous outfit and make up br br the plot is not at all clever it's something that's been repeated a million times in different movies the crooks were utterly stereotypical and lundgren's character hadn't any depth in it i didn't really expect a movie masterpiece but unfortunately this is not even decent action every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the unbelievable amount of over the top unrealism and comic book like characters started to annoy me strongly pretty soon br br i would recommend this to young kids wanting some comic like action but only if nothing else is available br br 1 10 i guess the current average vote of 7 0 with 6 votes must have been influenced by somebody involved in making this movie
<START> wow pretty terrible stuff the richard burton elizabeth taylor roadshow lands in sardinia and hooks up with arty director joseph losey for this remarkably ill conceived tennessee williams fiasco taylor plays a rich dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates very loudly her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary when scoundrel burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend taylor realizes her time is up ludicrious in the extreme it's difficult to determine if taylor and burton are acting badly or if it was williams' intention to make their characters so unappealing if that's the case then the acting is brilliant burton mumbles his lines including the word boom several times while taylor screeches her's she's really awful so is noel coward as taylor's catty confidante the witch of capri br br presumably boom is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along two standard williams themes but it's so misdirected by losey that had taylor and burton not spelled it out for the audience during their mostly inane monologues any substance the film has would have been completely diluted br br boom does have stunning photography the camera would have to have been out of focus to screw up the beauty of sardinia the supporting cast features joanna shimkus the great romolo valli as taylor's resourceful doctor and michael dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard both he and his dogs do a number on burton
<START> the movie appeals to public due to charisma of ben stiller and notoriety of j aniston it seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title but there's nothing successful in this movie br br polly is very well played by aniston no doubt this is the kind of character which suits her perfectly br br bem stiller is the same troublesome guy like in meet the parents but in this movie the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above br br the script is very poor with nothing special at all with this two well payed actors the things could get a lot better but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script br br 4 out of 10
<START> please avoid this movie at all costs this is without a doubt the worst movie i've ever seen most movies have at least one redeeming value this has none totally horrible
<START> i saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages for it to be released here in canada still only in limited release it was worth the wait and then some i am a very avid reader of margaret laurence and was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a film i actually ended up liking the movie better than the novel i liked that the character of bram shipley was a bit less harsh and that there seemed to be more of a love story between hagar and bram which made the scenes at the end of bram's life that much more moving the loss seemed stronger hagar was not any more likable on film than in the book but ellen burstyn was a genius in this role she was hagar through and through christine horne was brilliant and has many more great things ahead i am sure her scenes with cole hauser were electrifying i could go on and on overall a 9 out of 10 fantastic and can't wait for it to come out on dvd a must own for my collection
