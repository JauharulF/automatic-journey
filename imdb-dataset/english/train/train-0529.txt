<START> i was raised in a very christian household since birth i was saved before i saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church this movie was highly disturbing i saw it when i was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years i used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my mom's footsteps upstairs if i didn't hear her footsteps i would sneak upstairs to make sure she hadn't been raptured i used to pray so hard every night for salvation because i was terrified of jesus forgetting me this is definitely not something i will show to my kids until they are much older if at all it took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me
<START> ok a slasher movie a very very stupid slasher movie br br we got your stereotypical teenagers in a house thing going we got a fbi agent that's seen dirty harry one time too many so what's the secret punks we got about 4 different little camera shots and scene that make no sense at all hey man i'm fixing the sprinklers that guy was my favorite part of the movie suddenly there's a preacher tied up on a couch watching home movies he gets killed br br they follow the killer into the middle of nowhere with no cops suddenly she's in a church wearing a wedding dress i swear this is the stupidest slasher movie i've ever seen
<START> i've often wondered just how much casper was meant for children with all the issues revolving around his identity in this film we are lead to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child as his home is a cemetery plot as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film maybe casper was meant more as a morality play or famous studios felt like breaking new ground in 'reality' cartoons br br there's good boos tonight is a well animated project no doubt there but the plot development involving the fox who becomes casper's friend but meets a tragic end is a concern br br give famous studios credit they tackle death with respect but the stark image of casper's mourning is rather graphic and disturbing for children though the denouement does offer a happy ending but i won't give away the ending and the violence is rather steep even for 1940's standards br br this might be a good cartoon for parents to use in helping explain death to children but i wouldn't pop it into the vcr for a perky cartoon break
<START> what's that there in the skies is it a plane is it superman errr noÂ it's a turtle see that's what becomes of the cold war nothing but bad news and other issues the americans shoot down a russian combat plane somewhere over artic territory and the subsequent explosion defrosts literally awakens the giant prehistoric turtle creature named gammera he she is not a very friendly critter as it promptly ensues to destroy everything and everyone on its path the arguing governments finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a brand new and super sophisticated ice bomb but gammera has another surprise in storeÂ the damn turtle can fly the first time this happens results in a tremendously grotesque and hilarious sequence gammera lies on his back looking defeated when suddenly fire blows from his armpits and he skyrockets himself up in the air how can you not love that then there's also a dire sub plot about an annoying kid who's able to telepathically communicate with the monster but that's just not interesting enough flying turtle people there's very little else to write about this japanese and american re edited sci fi effort apart from that it's an obvious and totally shameless rip off of such classics like the original godzilla and the beast from 20 000 fathoms the effects and monster designs are extremely hokey and unlike the aforementioned films it never succeeds in creating an apocalyptic ambiance respectable actors like brian donlevy the quatermass experiment and dick o'neill wolfen seem unaware of what film set they're on and even the original japanese mayhem scenes aren't very convincing gammera's very own and personalized theme song is rather cool though so it gets one extra point for that
<START> paris is the place to be to enjoy beautiful art and music and to fall madly in love as is the case in this film boy meets girl they fall in love but something stands in their way of eternal happiness the classic story br br the wonderful music of george gerschwin complements the great dancing by gene kelly and leslie caron an american in paris is a humorous light hearted loving film well worth watching br br 8 10 br br
<START> sholay considered to be one of the greatest films i always wondered if they would ever remake being the classic it is that was the time rgv announced this movie and i was somewhat excited to see it i always thought that maybe this will be a good movie but every week we would here rgv change something and the movie is a very b grade movie something that i had not hoped br br i really tried looking for positives but i promised to keep sholay out of my mind the cinematography is awesome the movie tries to be its own but that is the up side the action sequences are weak the screenplay had potential the biggest flaw is editing none of the scenes excite you for example the comedy sequences felt very out of place and forced ironic because comedy was just as entertaining in the original and none of the characters are developed and no scenes will linger until the end and the ending was very disappointing br br the biggest question is acting amitabh bachchan was good as gabbar singh nothing great it seemed as if they concentrated too much on his look that the character only looks menacing but you don't get creeped out mohanlal is barely in the movie but he impresses in his few scenes ajay devgan was decent it wasn't so much the performance he gave it his all it was the weak script prashant raj is very confident and has potential to make it far with better movies br br i had most expectations for sushmita sen who was probably the best of the lot she was expressive but this still was not enough nisha kothari surprised me she seemed disinterested for the most part but her emotional scene after her friend's death was quite good seems as if she needs to find a director who will help her talent not her cute looks but what disappointed me most was chemistry ajay devgan and prashant raj didn't look like friends ajay nisha were not a strong couple no passion was to be found between sushmita and prashant and amitabh and mohanlal did not the hateful passion they needed br br as for songs they pretty much suck urmila's mehbooba was too overblown and i pretty much slept through it it was however nicely danced the holi number was enjoyable but not memorable same went for the other songs for someone who looked forward to this movie i was heavily disappointed i had high hopes for rgv because of his jungle but seems as if he lost his talent during the shooting of this movie but hopefully he regains his talent for sarkar raj but this movie is best forgotten all the positives still do not make up for the boring movie it is
<START> when you read the summary of this film you might come to think that this is something of an odd film and in some ways it is for the primary character of this film gerard reve jeroen krabbÃ© is haunted by visions and hallucinations the visions gerard see are all more or less subtle hints to what will happen to him as the story continues and it is great fun for the viewer to try and figure out the symbolism used in the film despite the use of symbolism and a couple of hints to the ending of the film the film maintains a very high level of excitement throughout and does not get boring for one minute this is mostly due to the great performances of jeroen krabbÃ© and renÃ©e soutendijk christine and the great direction of the whole by paul verhoeven his directing style is clearly visible and one can say looking at it from different angles that 'de vierde man' is a typical verhoeven film it will not only seem typical for people familiar with his american films because of the nudity and the graphic violent scenes but it will also seem typical for people familiar with his dutch films because of the same things and his talent to tell a great story when people watch verhoevens american films short sighted people might say he has no talent in telling a good story and only focuses on blood and sex that is what some people think whereas i think that he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each with each film although not a good film hollow man his last american film is an example that verhoeven can do more than science fiction splatter movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more various films to helm he needs that just watch his dutch films not only do they show that he needs a certain amount of freedom but they also show that he has remarkable talent 'de vierde man' brought him one step closer to hollywood and is certainly one of his best br br 8 out of 10
<START> i really enjoyed this movie i am a single dad with a 17 year old daughter who is smart athletic and talented i wish my girl applied herself so well to solving crimes and helping others so for me perhaps this is pg level fantasyland i read many nancy drew books in my teen years long long ago sure this character was ably played by emma roberts but did not resemble the nancy drew i recall from the books that is due to script not the acting br br emma is an adorable teen playing a self confident industrious and proud character with good manners and good taste she is not caught up in the trendy competitiveness around her there are some weaknesses in the plot aside from not resembling the nancy drew of the books and trying to figure out what decade we're in like what is that car anyway br br i read the imdb overview before seeing the film as i was researching rachael leigh cook from other movies this is not one of her best roles but i will continue looking for more of her films rachael was too old to play this lead but does a fine job as the grown up orphan central to the mystery br br i am very disappointed in other reviews written here some expect perfect connection with the books some expect more credible situations or adult action film i got what i expected good entertainment well targeted to young teen girls and their fathers who want good kids with high standards of conduct and achievement this is a teen pg movie not james bond which would you want for a role model for your teenaged daughter
<START> some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous not painful to watch with your significant other i was apologizing to my boyfriend the entire movie br br it was so slow and awfully strange br br both redgraves vanessa and natasha were unfit for this especially with vanessa doing that ridiculous brash american accent br br claire danes was the same wiggly lipped awkward girl that she was in my so called life she has yet to push herself in any way girl find a new way to pretend to cry br br meryl streep was one of the only redeeming part of this movie she was on screen for five minutes and i swear to god she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake br br oh and hugh dancy who gets better every time i see him br br glenn close and eileen atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes br br i mean this was a well shot movie it was very pretty the settings were interestingly dressed providing relief for the intense boredom i was feeling br br i don't know it's just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of the greatest actresses of our time sucks so much it sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors and the main character ann was a huge jerk i was glad she died but that's because i felt bad for lila ann's friend mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy br br ugh bad job evening the film you weren't entertaining and you weren't even thought provoking i sure hope the book was better so it didn't waste even more of people's time 3 10
<START> this is the best mob film ever made it deserved more then what it got at the oscars nominated for things like its score art direction supporting role newman this film could have easily been nominated for best picture director mendes actor hanks supporting actor newman and law and won hanks gives one of his best performances and the kid who played michel jr was so good that i'm surprised i don't see him in more movies today critics themselves didn't give this film enough credit but besides the incredible performances another real star of this film is the incredible music this was by far the best score of the year it was nominated but didn't win this is a great film that should be seen by everyone my grade a
<START> no likeable characters the lead is a combination of the worst of woody allen paul provensa reiser and the contrived scenes did anyone really think thiat kid on the rollerblades was not going to knock the guy down were just sickeningly bad br br
<START> this is a gem a real piece of americana for all that this implies if you are self programed to resist life afirming stories just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe and what makes the frosting on the cake truly delectable is that it is fact based on a real rags to riches story no need to nit pick what details were changed to make a compact story chris cooper is one of the greatest living actors and the complex self conflicted bottom line good at the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by someone with his skill and insight the simple minded comments refusing to accept a father who tries to lay down the law all the while sensing that he may possibly be off track expose the limitation of the commentator not the writers or the acting this is not for the cynical or the simple minded
<START> the thing that really gets me about this movie that is the thing about this movie that makes me physically ill is that someone actually paid to have it made there is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this movie it is not frightening it is not thought provoking it is not entertaining it is not good it is a sleeping pill made of cyanide the dvd case compares it to blair witch evil dead and a few other decent movies making the filmmaker's desperation glaringly obvious it is nothing like any other movie ever made it is far far worse the claims of an extremely shocking ending you will never forget are the equivalent of one ton of stinking horse droppings please do not ever waste your time watching this piece of trash because it may make you sterile the man who wrote this movie should be wiped off the writer's guild membership list and never allowed to film anything again because if he thought this was a movie worth making he probably does not have much of anything to offer in the future zero stars may grod have mercy on the soul of anyone unfortunate enough to see this i am going to go vomit now
<START> i should never have started this film and stopped watching after 3 4's i missed the really botched ending this film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better it had nice atmosphere a top notch cast and director good locations but a baaaaaad story line a bad script i paid attention to kenneth branagh's southern accent it was better than the script the plot was stupid driven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways no one behaves like this outside of hollywood scripts
<START> this movie can be labeled as a study case it's not just the fact that it denotes an unhealthy and non artistic lust for anything that might be termed as caco imagery the author lives with the impression that his sanctimonious revolt against some generic and childishly termed social ills moldavia is the most pauper region of europe i don't believe one iota in the birds flu romanian people steal because they are poor europeans steal because they are thieves are more or less close to a responsible moral and artistic attitude but he is sorely off target br br what daneliuc doesn't know is that it's not enough to pose as a righteous person you also need a modicum of professionalism talent and intelligence to transpose this stance into an artistic product fatefully the foreign legion shows as much acumen as a family video with uncle gogu drunkenly wetting himself in front of the guests the script is chaotic and incoherent randomly bustling together sundry half subjects in an illiterate attempt to suggest some kind of a story the direction is pathetically dilettante the so called director is unable to build up at least a mediocre mise en scene his shots are annoyingly awkward and any sense of storytelling shines by total absence of course any comment is forced to stop at this level it would be ridiculous to mention concepts as cinematographic language means of expression or style the acting is positively cÃ¢ntarea romÃ¢niei romania's chant level with the exception of paradoxically the soccer goal keeper necula raducanu who is very natural and nicodim ungureanu oana piecnita seems to have a genuine freshness but she is compromised by the amateurish directions given by daneliuc br br the most serious side of this offense to decent cinema is the fact that the production received a hefty financing from the national budget via c n c the national cinematography council the fact that long time dead old dinosaurs like daneliuc are still thirsty for the government udder is understandable in a market driven economy they would be instantly eliminated through natural selection but the corruption of the so called jury that squanders the country's money on such ridiculously scabrous non art non cinema and non culture belongs to the criminal field
<START> this movie was so badly written directed and acted that it beggars belief it should be remade with a better script director and casting service the worst problem is the acting you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished professional and totally believable and on the other hand ri'chard who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning and keeping couple although both normally do fine work the actors and director should not have attempted to do accents at all they are inconsistent and unbelievable much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english the casting is ludicrous why have children of an african merchant thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society been cast with very pale skinned actors while the supposedly socially desirable marcel has pronounced african features including an obviously dyed blond fro it's as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color it's just so weird this could be a great movie and should be re made but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors there are plenty of good actors out there and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast good script and decent direction
<START> always enjoy the great acting talents of harry hamlin jim lansford strange hearts '01 who plays a straight as an arrow husband who seems to get all kinds of attention from very charming young women namely lisa zane lynne monkeybone '01 who is a co worker with jim lansford and you wonder why he doesn't try to hit on her for some fun annie potts kris lansford breaking the rules '92 is a very warm and sweet loving wife to jim and has complete trust in her husband kris wants to always keep her husband happy and even buys him a home with out him even seeing it for himself this film will keep you guessing right to the very end
<START> this is the only movie that my wife and i have ever walked out on totally sucked we saw it in omaha even not funny at all looks like a 14 year old kid wrote the humor i can't believe these real politicians were actually in the movie awful
<START> one of my favourite domestic movies i don't know if there is any person in our country who hasn't seen this movie it's funny and sad at some moments i don't know how did people around the world who had opportunity to watch it accept this movie because you have to know some moments in our serbian history and character of serbs in the first half of the 20th century to be able to understand it but as i see here there is somebody from canada who watched it and he liked it br br i think that i'll try to put all good quotes from the movie on this site but first to find out how to do that br br cheers
<START> i have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it which was sometime last year anyway i got to see today and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after 10 mins or so i thought that the movie was pretty good but the thing i didn't like was how the killer was created i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like urban legends final cut i almost died it mostly everything in ul final cut needed to be improved cut is 100 times better than ul final cut the best part of cut is the killer and the death scenes the killer kicks mo f ing ass br br i give cut a 8 out of 10
