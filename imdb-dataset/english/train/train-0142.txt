<START> this intensely involving 2007 character driven suspense drama is like a big juicy piece of shakespearean level steak from a master filmmaker who knows how to draw out uncommonly ferocious to the edge performances from his actors consider for starters henry fonda's lone dissenting juror in twelve angry men katharine hepburn's delusional mary tyrone in long day's journey into night rod steiger's conflicted concentration camp survivor in the pawnbroker william holden's wintry lion in network and paul newman's alcoholic lawyer in the verdict the list encompasses some of the finest screen work of the past half century and you can safely add philip seymour hoffman's desperately controlling andy hanson to the ranks at 83 director sidney lumet shows no signs of octogenarian fatigue and in fact he revels in the melodramatic turns of first time screenwriter kelly masterson's thickly plotted script br br the scale of the story is deceptively small as it focuses on the moral compromises that unravel in a family where two brothers have become desperate for immediate cash woody allen followed a similar fraternal dynamic in his last film the oddly pinched cassandra's dream but lumet is neither pinched nor cautious in his fierce approach to this inescapable tale of ambiguity and deception the plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless embezzling funds from his real estate company's payroll to keep his neglected wife gina happy and to satisfy an expensive drug habit smooth talking andy is about to be exposed in an irs audit meanwhile his younger brother hank is a mass of post divorce codependent insecurities falling way behind in his alimony and child support payments br br andy concocts a supposedly foolproof plan to rob their parents' suburban jewelry store while neither of them is supposed to be there the goal was for the brothers to collect the haul and the parents to claim the insurance murphy's law intervenes in every possible way starting with andy pressuring hank to do the job himself after some brotherly cajoling hank agrees to it but too scared to do it alone he recruits a reckless gun toting busboy to handle the robbery by fate the heist occurs on the one day that andy and hank's mother is opening the shop and things quickly spiral out of control from there although the back and forth storytelling technique is not new for example alejandro gonzÃ¡lez iÃ±Ã¡rritu's 21 grams masterson's approach works effectively in delineating certain events from multiple perspectives so that you understand how each character is led to the repercussions of the unfortunate event br br the acting is pitch perfect starting with hoffman's riveting performance as andy a machiavellian reptile whose cool exterior and innate amorality mask layers of resentment toward his family i thought he was great in tamara jenkins' the savages but he is even better here lumet even draws a solid performance from the usually insufferable ethan hawke as hank imbuing him with the emasculated weakness that informs his every ill planned move as their embattled father albert finney acts with his typical late career bluster but he provides the necessary foundation for the oedipal level complexities marisa tomei is a smart choice to play gina as the actress economically keys in on the responsive watchful nature of a small but pivotal role the estimable theater veteran rosemary harris now better known as peter parker's aunt in the spider man trilogy has precious little time as the mother as does amy ryan as hank's bitter ex wife br br there are scenes that border on excessive especially as the situation becomes increasingly desperate for the brothers but the principals inject such energetic brio to them that the flourishes become forgivable after the disappointment of the cartoonish find me guilty it is refreshing to see lumet in peak form here the 2008 dvd offers terrifically informative commentary from lumet hoffman and hawke all of whom converse with ease and insight throughout along with the original theatrical trailer there is also a better than average 24 minute featurette directed by sidney lumet how the devil was made which features on set footage and snippets of interviews with lumet two of the producers and the principal actors
<START> henry fool is a better film but this is the perfect way to follow up a film like 'henry fool ' to take henry very seriously his 'lies' and his mysterious aura even the opening shot of 'henry fool' when simon puts his ear to the ground as henry comes walking over the hill is more fully manifest through 'fay grim ' the over the top jokes that are more or less meta jokes about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves are good but the opening of the film is a little saturated in them also hartley's use of dutch angles throughout the film is jarring yes it's intention but it feels forced and over used it goes beyond jarring to what i'd like to call annoying it's a flawed film but a must see for any hartley or 'henry fool' fan br br and don't listen to stupid reviews don't watch this unless you've seen the first film the intrigue satire and wit of this movie is totally lost if you haven't seen henry fool it's a sequel that's just dumb
<START> ok it was a good american pie erick stifler goes off to college with his buddy cooze during their arrival they meet up with eric's cousin dwight the two pledge to become betas and along the way they get involved with a whole lot of sex tits and some hot girls along the way in a few words there is a lot more sex nudity and alcohol it is a good movie for those who want to enjoy an american pie movie granted it isn't as great as the first three is is a good movie if you enjoy hot girls with really nice tits get this movie if you enjoy seeing a bunch of dudes making assholes of themselves go to this movie if you want to see the full thing get the unrated addition one last thing this is a better attempt than the last two american pies
<START> or maybe it just is this bad the plot is a cheap rehash of the first which is weird since it's supposed to be a prequel not a sequel pretty much the entire movie seems like a cheap remake of the first with scenes mimicking the things that happened in the first only a lot more ridiculous and unlikely where the first had a great cast this one consist of b list actors and rejects the acting is mostly horrendously bad half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first as is nearly every major character including the ones who weren't in the first movie i realize this was made up by a tv series pilot episode but that's no excuse they didn't have to turn the bad footage into a movie only one thing is marginally good and that's the erotic sequences however as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first even this isn't raising it above a rating of 1 if you have a chance to see it for free and you're a straight guy it could be worth checking out if you want something erotic that isn't porn if not avoid at all costs 1 10
<START> did anyone edit this film or was it only the dvd release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes it's ok though i fell asleep watching it the first time then i fell asleep the second time and the third time the plot is actually not the worst i've seen but it's close the acting is not the worst i've seen either but it's close the production well i can honestly say that it was the worst i had ever seen in my life not trying to be spiteful but unhinged could have used some more production br br please don't think i'm a hater of horror films or even that i didn't enjoy this film i just felt i was laughing at the film much more than i felt i was laughing along with it the gruesome moments were not too poorly done but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget br br characters seemed awkwardly developed or ignored all together twist ending was pretty bad and the exposition took forever without exposing much br br i'd recommend avoiding this movie br br 1 10
<START> what would happened when a depressed cop works with a shrink on probation may be a lot of fun this movie set a benchmark in the action comedy genre of the argentinean cinema dearable characters probable story and a pace that between laughs has some thrill i recommended it for a pleasant time of entertaining peretti and luque join their efforts to fight against a cold and daringly foe in a time when it's difficult to trust someone this movie will surprise you the other side of the coin of analyze me but not alike with nothing to envy and if you like to know bs as there where few scenes of downtown and the city center
<START> an excellent film depicting the cross currents in the lives of a multi ethnic mix of not so ordinary people in the rural pacific northwest solid directing and writing along with fine acting especially the performances by kwami taha and dan stowe interestingly this film was made in the same year as the highly successful crash written and directed by paul haggis the pace of the action may not be as frantic as that in urban los angeles and the characters may seem to be better acquainted with each other in apart from that but the personal relationships of the characters are as flawed and troubled and their stories as resonant as any of those in crash for those viewers who appreciated crash this is a must see film also fans of jim jarmusch and john cassavetes will like this movie
<START> though the story is essentially routine and the surprise ending is nothing but a bad joke on the audience you can see what attracted these good actors to the project it offers them the kind of roles in which good actors can shine and shine they do the film is impeccably made for its time it was remade in 2000 as under suspicion and if you only want to see one version of the story that's all it deserves really i recommend the latter one with hopkins' up to date direction and the more explicit references to plot points that the original could only hint at the ending however still blows 1 2
<START> anna charlotte burke who is just on the verge of puberty begins to have strange dreams which start affecting her in real life especially involving a boy named mark elliott spiers who she meets in her dreams br br very unusual fantasy with some truly terrifying moments despite the fact that this is about a teenage girl and has a pg 13 rating this is not for children also if you hate fantasies stay far away but if you're game for something different this fits the bill br br well directed by bernard rose with a just beautiful music score and a few nice scary jolts the only thing that prevents this from being a really great movie is burke she's not a very good actress it's no surprise that this has been her only film and it hurts the movie however everybody else is just great br br spiers is very good as mark glenne headley faking a british accent very well is also very good as anna's mother and ben cross is both frightening and sympathetic as anna's father br br a sleeper hit when released in 1988 it's since faded away that's too bad it's really very good
<START> this movie is gorgeous it's real and down to heart but at the same time totally crazy the characters are easy to fall in love with because they have so many different minds but each of us could refer to at least on in canada we don't have many movies from eastern europe and for the few i have seen loners is one of the best it's very funny and magic if you want to see something new and refreshing go see loners
<START> first let me say that i am not a dukes fan but after this movie the series looked like law and order the worst thing was the casting of roscoe and boss hogg burt reynolds is not boss hogg and even worse was m c gainey as roscoe if they ever watched the show roscoe was not a hard ass cop he was more a barney fife than the role he played in this movie br br the movie is loaded with the usual errors cars getting torn up and continues like nothing happened the worst example of this is when the the general gets together with billy prickett and the general is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop but goes on to win the race
<START> this is the epitome of fairytale the villains are completely wicked and the heroes are refreshingly pure danes deniro and pfieffer are wonderful as well as the new actor who plays the role of tristan outstanding performances delightful magic funny and dramatic and a perfect fairytale ending make this film absolutely fabulous i'm not so sure all content is appropriate for younger children but for an older audience there are plenty of hilarious subtleties the previews do not do this movie justice my fiancÃ© and i were quite skeptical but were so thrilled we had taken a chance on this movie that i can only hope to assure anyone on the fence about this movie to give it a try
<START> this movie is great simply it is rare that you find a comedy with levels and this is a bloody good example of such when i saw this movie first as the credit rolled a friend and i looked to one another and asked 'did you just catch that ' for those doubters look at the levels see the comparisons between vick and the people in the club the dna see the diverse characters each jostling for position and if you see nothing else see the connection between the cure of vick and the path through the film it's all in vick's head the opening line about vick's world the closing scene with the camera going into vick's head and inside a whole universe thoroughly quotable wonderful cartoon gangsters beautiful beautiful beautiful
<START> before starting to watch the show i've heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting what a deception the scripts are so dumb that i am quite sure the authors are son and grandson of scoobidoo writers and what about the sfx and colors they are so extreme that it is painful to watch colors are not saturated they are over saturated like scripts are overwritten and show is overrated this show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best they are sufficient unfortunately for this show the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility
<START> chillers starts on a cold dark stormy night as a bus drops off three passenger's outside a bus station a young boy named mason jesse emery a college professor dr howard conrow david wohl a woman named sharon phillips laurie pennington inside they discover that they have missed their connecting bus are stranded for the night in the waiting area they find two other people ronnie jim wolf a sleeping woman named lindsay marjorie fitzsimmons who is currently having a terrifying nightmare br br while swimming in an indoor pool lindsay encounters befriends guy named billy waters jesse johnson the next time lindsay sees billy he dives into the pool then seemingly disappears into thin air before he surfaces shortly after lindsay discovers that billy water died in a diving accident 5 years ago br br lindsay wakes up tells the others about her nightmare everyone else responds by saying that they too have suffered disturbing dreams recently decide to share them to pass the time br br next up is mason who tells a story of how he two friends scott david r hamm jimmy will tuckwiller are terrorised during a camping trip br br then it's sharon whose story revolves around a newsman named tom williams thom delventhal who she phones up in no time at all tom is at her front door but he actually turns out to be a vampire br br it's ronnie's turn next he describes how he discovers that he can bring the dead back to life unfortunately he brings executed mass murderer nelson caulder bradford boll back to homicidal life br br finally dr conrow tells a tale of how two of his students brought an ancient aztec war god named ixpe kimberly harbour back to life br br then it's back to the bus station for one last predictable twist br br written produced directed by daniel boyd chillers is one of the worst horror anthologies i've ever seen i usually really like this sub genre the script by boyd lacks what is needed for films such as chillers to work you can see the final twist coming a mile off each story is really lame the first one is totally pointless didn't seem to have an ending the best thing about these anthologies are the short snappy stories that are rounded off with a neat twist the second story is predictable again just ends without any payoff so it continues throughout chillers that each story is deeply unsatisfying to watch have no reward for doing so the character's dialogue are poorly written the stories seem to have no original ideas of their own as a whole the film totally sucks at least each story doesn't last long i liked the idea behind the linking segments br br director boyd was obviously working with a very low budget it shows all i can say is if you want to watch a 15 odd minute short story set entirely within a swimming pool then chillers is for you the stories are neither clever scary or have any sort of tension or build up to anything having said that it does have a few nice scenes some surprising competence shines through on occasion violence gore wise there isn't much happening in chillers a ripped out heart a decapitated head a bitten off hand is as gory as it gets br br technically chillers is poor stuff that won't impress anyone basic cinematography bad music cheap special effects below average production values chillers also features one of the worst closing theme songs ever period the acting is also of a very low standard br br i am sure a lot of effort was put into chillers as a low budget film at least the filmmakers tried so i will give credit for that at least but that still doesn't stop me from thinking it's crap similar anthology films like tales from the crypt 1972 asylum 1972 the vault of horror 1973 dr terror's house of horrors 1965 creepshow 1982 tales from the darkside the movie 1990 are far superior to chillers so watch one of those instead
<START> a journey of discovery this film follows the lives of one family living in a sleepy island town in british columbia languorous and dreamy the inhabitants are satisfied to allow life to go on around them until a young fresh faced teacher with new ideas arrives and brings with her life from the mainland slowly their indolent state is awakened the father and principal of the local school looks for excitement the mother for stability the oldest daughter for love and the youngest for power while not an incredible or ground breaking piece of cinema the movie is quietly enjoyable and good for a tired night when the wind is blowing unfortunately i doubt anyone outside of canada will find it easily accessible
<START> a slight charming little movie to be sure but a superbly crafted one gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue this came out around the time of sense and sensibility and i'm sure i don't know why that one garnered all the oscar attention emma is jane austen's most accessible and least stuffy story told well
<START> this is indeed a treat for every bolan fan some might think that it's a little over the top and that it is only about ringo and marc's egos but i think it's similar to any other concert video except for the fact that this is marc bolan not just any guy i especially liked the music video for children of the revolution with elton john and ringo starr this clip alone is worth all the money i can't believe they did'not release this version as the single the movie is really superb especially for us danes now i wasn't alive during the 70's but danes in general was totally shot out from what was happening around them the media didn't play or show any of the popular music back then including marc bolan and t rex they only played a little with the doors only the really popular songs though so i know from my dad that seeing this gives him back a part of his youth he never got to experience br br i wont make this too long so if you're the least bit fan of marc bolan you need to see this you might find it boring or as said before a little over the top but at least you've seen one of the best musicians ever in action br br only thing that disappoints me a little is that ride a white swan isn't on the tape but i forgive it since jeepster and get it on are so wonderfully played
<START> i bought this movie last weekend at my local movie gallery it was buy 2 get 2 free and i needed one more so i chose this one horrible mistake the box reads like it would be a really good movie well it starts out like it is going to be this great movie for about 5 minutes that is the movie is about a young woman laila who gets killed trying to save her beau jack from a bull laila's dad cordobes is a rancher that the townspeople are afraid of he assumes that jack killed laila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull and goes on this hunt to find him that was the first 5 minutes that is good what follows after that is only gonna get 100 times worse whoever wrote the script in my opinion had to of been on some kind acid trip or something because nothing else made any sense what so ever jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio dj named mary who gives him a ride i think mary is supposed to be a virgin mary type character you know jesus' mother but who knows i couldn't make heads or tails of it as they're running we get to see bad guys magical visions ghostly encounters flashbacks etc and all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what's going on needless to say i took the movie back and exchanged it for something else it's horrible i tell ya horrible and there is absolutely no bull fighting in this movie unless you count the first minute of the movie hope i helped some other people keep from wasting their time on this movie
<START> my 10 10 rating is merely for the fun factor and assumes that you decided that you liked slaughter high even before watching it yes it's the typical revenge several years after a dirty prank story but how can you not like some of the stuff that they pull here i couldn't have predicted that bathtub scene in a million years br br ok so maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie offers nothing new well it doesn't pretend to it's the sort of flick that the characters in scream probably watched and it contributed to their rules about how to survive a horror movie after all who doesn't like to watch people suffer for doing these things obviously it's got sort of a reactionary undertone as people get punished for doing what the '60s championed but still you gotta love this stuff so with apologies to don mclean this jester didn't sing for the king and queen
