<START> i went into this hoping it would be the thought provoking little gem people have reviewed this as i love indy films and expected to dig this too knowing what a hot button this topics is i expected to be really entertained maybe even see an outsiders perspective br br all i can say is wow if your into self torture or mutilation then maybe you'll like this personally i don't like the idea of being pee'd on or cutting myself so i thought it was garbage bad script bad acting bad story bad directing bad editing i could go on i have no clue why a reviewer claimed he or she was making a political point by giving this movie a 10 that's misleading and ignorant voting for a movie on imdb isn't setting a precedent it just lets other people think that a garbage bomb like this is ok to watch as long as it's controversial this film is not it tries very hard to be but fails br br you know the movie is bad when 15 minutes into it your praying that all main characters die horrifically unfortunately they do die but not in the painful manners that would have given the viewer some justice or vindication for having watched the 2 hours of crap they just endured br br do yourself a favor just don't even bother i got this movie in a bargain bin at my local video store for 50 and feel ripped off
<START> this is a gory mess and pretty convincing corbin bernson is very much in command of this movie with his slick portrayal of the loony control freak eponymous practitioner linda hoffman plays his cheating wife and she is very easy on the eye unfortunately for her the little tryst with the pool guy brings severe punishment in a way the good doctor knows best shame about that pretty smile the last half hour of the movie is devoted to bernson's character losing it completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress called virginya keehne an extremely talented performer she hogs the limelight from the moment the braces come off nice legs too
<START> of all the breakdancing hip hop films released between 1983 and 1986 the 1984 film beat street is unquestionably the best one the story follows a dj his younger breakdancing brother a graffiti artist and a wanna be showbiz promoter through one winter in which they try to break out of the ghetto using their street talent the acting isn't always up to par and the characters aren't fully drawn out but they are more than compensated for by down to earth dialogue a plausible story fantastic dancing sequences and a timeless hip hop sound track it should be noted this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdancing this ain't new york this is the bronx and features appearances by the fathers of breakdancing dance troupe rock steady crew and rapper afrika bambaata rock steady crew provide the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the premiere breakdancing club of the early 80's the roxy a must see for hip hop lovers
<START> slasher films are often seen as the derivative repetitive and frankly unoriginal i happen to to be a horror movie fan but this film was just so poor words fail me the script is severely lacking the plot is ridiculous the acting astoundingly bad just an all round stinker that i wasted time of my life on this had all the entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a film that was dire in the first place br br who greenlit this mess br br i only liked two things in this movie the first was the killer's mask which was nice the second was the austrailian affinity with humourous profanity br br save yourself and avoid this hideous mess
<START> bend it like beckham is packed with intriguing scenes yet has an overall predictable stroy line it is about a girl called jess who is trying to achieve her life long dream to become a famous soccer player and finally gets the chance when offered a position on a local team there are so many boundaries and limits that she faces which hold her back yet she is still determined and strives i would recommend it for anyone who likes a nice light movie and wants to get inspired by what people can achieve the song choices are really good 'hush my child just move on up to your destination and you make boundaries and complications ' anyway hope that was at help to your needs in a review bend it like beckham great flick
<START> the only reason i'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played tadashi's tormentors were not up to the job i presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy but they were not well coached and their scenes were a minor annoyance br br i say not to judge this by u s standards because it's full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that japanese culture readily embraces and is not beholden to the black hat white hat moral constraints u s kids' films are routinely subjected to for example there is a preciously funny moment when tadashi's small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai and shojo the avuncular kirin herald does what many a stressed out japanese adult would do hint this would not happen in a disney film this picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids' movie br br early on there's a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book there was a tv commercial in japan a couple years before this movie came out it was a stop motion clay animation about a kid who's depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room his mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up then someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a dope slap that leaves a dent in his forehead i mention this commercial because it was considered funny and i didn't hear any objections to it while i was there there is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in the great yokai war than one would find in a disney movie as a parent if this were a u s film i would be up in arms about such things although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture which of course are also not black and white since it's a japanese movie i accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a u s production however i'd probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of pre show briefing and or post show debriefing about the violence and other off color stuff or i'd wait till they're older to show it to them
<START> in terms of visual beauty this movie is outstanding i had no idea that technicolor came out so early although i didn't like the ending the entire movie is fantastic and makes me wish that i was in north africa the cast is excellent and marlene dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so alluring and i just loved her in this flick basil rathbone is also perfect in this movie i couldn't get over the scenery and the sets the hotel the palm trees the desert it's all there the legionnaires also bring a beau geste feeling to the film they certainly don't make movies like these anymore don't fail to watch this classic
<START> i heard this film was much more stylistic than the films director guy ritchie lock stock and two smoking barrels snatch had directed before the problem is it is possibly too stylistic basically jake green jason statham is released from prison after seven years in solitary and within two years he gambles loads of his money he is ready to seek revenge against the violence prone casino owner who got jake sent to prison dorothy 'mr d' macha ray liotta in the process doctors tell jake that he has three days left to live as he is dying from a rare blood disease oh and macha puts hit men on him loan sharks zach vincent pastore and avi andrÃ© benjamin are demanding jake pays their cash back and do some odd jobs for them the film is filled with jake narrating through some flashbacks and through his last three days before coming to the big revelation about zach and avi and macha well i assume that's what it was also starring terence maynard as french paul andrew howard as billy mark strong as sorter francesca annis as lily walker anjela lauren smith as doreen and elana binysh as rachel the are sequences involving a little bit of animation repeating lines twice in different perspectives and changing speeds for moments and all of these are irritating to the point of confusion and boredom making it a silly crime drama pretty poor
<START> 1 is being pretty generous here i really enjoyed boogeyman even though it is not really the boogeyman promoted on the dvd cover and we all know it it creeped me out but this film it is something else for being directed by a guy who has been around a long time and directed a lot of movies it looks like it was shot on a vhs camcorder by a 10 year old the story and acting are atrocious david hess you have let me down too after playing one of the most menacing villains in film history you have resorted to this the story and acting may have been able to be forgiven however if anyone had taken the time to make the video look somewhat professional there are a lot of shot on video films out there that don't look like it or at least aren't so obvious that it detracts your attention from the film i can't say it is the worst movie ever because i couldn't make it through the entire film but it is certainly close
<START> i've barely just made it through one episode crouch end the dialog was stilted and down right cringe worthy the acting was tragic eion bailey despite his best attempts to be dramatic remains mostly expressionless his eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment claire forlani could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie the characters were cartoons each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random meandering plot cheesy special effects can be excused given the tv miniseries budget but attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the unwatchability i get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story if i had to compare it's overall quality to something else i'd put this episode of nightmares and dreamscapes on par with the nbc's hercules
<START> horrible i see many user comments on how great this show is it truly is a wanna be friends made in taiwan knockoff the jokes are lame as and the plot is ridiculous the actors are obviously struggling to be funny and are probably cringing when they hit those awful punchlines if you can call them that the bulk of the other users who have commented are obviously from another planet or at least another continent there are obviously reasons that tv companies cancel shows and none of then are when shows are doing well make sense anyway steer clear even if it is raining and there is absolutely nothing else on this planet to do go stand in the rain instead more fun
<START> i noticed at once that this movie really wasn't based on dodie smith's novel in any case it was a nice idea that pongo and perdita's son now had his own puppies the cutest of the dalmatians was of course little snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film br br to be honest i didn't know what to think when cruella de vil seemed to have changed completely kind in fact i have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly but now that she so quickly changed into herself again and announced that she was cruella once more i almost began to be really worried about chloe's dalmatians br br actually the scene in which the puppies watched lady and the tramp while chloe and kevin had their dinner was much better than i had expected i also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie br br of course i was content that at the end the dalmatians were saved again but i would have liked to know what was going to happen to cruella after she had lost her whole property and what on earth could the dogs' home do with such a huge sum of money br br finally it was quite touching that snowball also had spots at the very end of the film
<START> i'm a huge randolph scott fan but this film is a dud the whole thing has a canned fake soundstage feel to it with truly awful rear screen projection it has a good plot idea that the screenwriter has successfully buried in a nitwit script which makes it impossible for the audience to become immersed in the action and truly care about any of the characters the directing is pedestrian and only accentuates how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it i've seen plenty of thoroughly enjoyable soundstage productions before but this is not one of them all it does is make you appreciate the gritty scott boetticher films all the more br br randolph scott is tanned trim and shines that million dollar smile throughout he's always a pleasure even in the worst of his films aside from scott the other main reason i wanted to see this movie was due to how much i enjoyed ms wymore in errol flynn's movie rocky mountian in man behind the gun she is just as beautiful and you can tell she's a good actress but she was forced to say some pretty dumb lines and the blocking she was given by the director was truly awful i've only seen phil carey in operation pacific and he plays the exact same character here an arrogant pain in the butt you want to beat into unconsciousness i guess it proves he's a good actor he made me hate him there are some lame attempts at comic relief that only detract from the film in my opinion although there are many elements to knock i must say that i found myself truly enjoying the two spanish songs sung in the musical numbers but that's not why we go to see randolph scott movies right br br there are definitely worse scott films out there and this one certainly isn't unbearable but it also certainly couldn't be deemed anything beyond mediocre
<START> i have to say that i used to be a huge fan of the series the first 3 were great and the others had their moments but this new beta house is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is a shame since this was a great series and it just keeps getting worse i know they are made for dvd films but some effort would be nice br br there are no laughs just a couple of good one liners that will bring a smile if that there is pretty of nudity and very hot chicks but neither the sexy stuff nor the jokes really work br br to add to all that this is a racist film too or as racist of a film one can make without asking to be called racist i am not one of those people who think everything should be politically correct but the portrayal of minorities is very offensive br br i wouldn't waste any time on this garbage see the previous versions they will make you laugh not sick
<START> tales from the crypt and all through the house starts on christmas eve as elizabeth mary ellen trainor kills her husband joseph marshall bell she drags his body outside ready to throw it down a well but while doing so misses an important news bulletin on the radio that says a homicidal maniac larry drake dressed as santa clause has escaped from a local mental asylum has already killed several women with elizabeth next on his list but she has other ideas tries to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to her advantage br br this tales from the crypt story was episode 2 from season 1 directed by the one of the show's regular executive producers robert zemeckis and all through the house is a decent enough watch the script by fred dekker was actually based on a story appearing in the comic 'the vault of horror' was originally adapted to film as one episode from the britsih horror anthology film tales from the crypt 1972 which starred joan collins as the murderous wife character here played by ellen trainor this particular version is good enough but doesn't do anything different or special is a bit too linear predictable to be considered a classic at only 25 minutes in length it certainly moves along at a good pace the story is just about macabre enough it generally provides decent entertainment i quite liked the downbeat ending this time there are christmas themed opening closing crypt keeper john kassir segments complete with the usual puns br br director zemeckis does a good job there's a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of christmas influence as well there's not much gore here someone has a poker stuck in their head someone's face is cut with an icicle someone's arm is cut with an axe there's some blood splatter but generally speaking it's not that graphic the acting by a small cast is pretty good br br and all through the house isn't the best tale from the crypt but it's a decent one all the same worth a watch but after the comic book story original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this
<START> make a 0 you sacks of german staples well when i started to watch this sack of crud it was a sunday afternoon and i was just looking for stuff on show time i was introduced to a hot naked babe and like any guy im a guy the e mail is my sisters i was happy but then they threw it all to the dogs spit on it lit it on fire and peed it out you wanna know how the dumb chick talked the dialog throughout the film was just horrible sounded like something my 2nd grade bro could wright the violence was nice for some scenes but some was just totally moronic the scene in the pit were he gives the guy the knife dumb moron to sum it up this is pure cinema barf drenched in the chocolate syrup known as nudity and topped with the cherry of horrible acting as only a porn star could deliver
<START> sly's best out and out action film it is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters solid performances and renny harlins direction is stylishly assured stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes this was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90's a definite genre classic as a stallone fan this is one i look back on with fond memories plenty of superb action and sly in prime action man form action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film the film looks great and there is great support from janine turner michael rooker and john lithgow
<START> if you played spider man on the ps version then you've seen it all to truly experience it you should get the dc version simply put it's a much graphically superior game the textures are sharp levels are easy to navigate and it has much better sound then it's ps cousin i bought this game back in late '00s and it still holds up even till this day well marvel ultimate alliance is a much superior and strategic game but if you're a fan of 'ol web head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library swinging around the city as spidey has never looked this good and dead on in a video game if you have a dreamcast snag this up for cheap the dc version is simply incredible
<START> the story turns around antonio 'scarface' montana an ultra violent cuban refugee who comes to the united states with less than nothing and makes a place for himself at the top of the cocaine trade br br as a calculating man with a conscience and extreme ambitions tony strongly begins to desire the things he sees a criminal high roller enjoying including his luscious lover heights his way out of a refugee camp by enjoying the chance to stab a former taker of freedom takes out rival dealers gains the confidence of an important drug lord by eclipsing a local gang boss in miami and eventually makes it to the highest levels of the drug organization br br pacino shows the results of greed and lust for power on the human psyche he guns his way through the sunny streets of miami where he got 'the world and everything in it ' with his ruthlessness obscene dialog and his negotiation skills he begins to imagine himself invulnerable and above all others he quickly moves deep to the world of gangs and becomes more ruthless than anyone else can possibly imagine br br michelle pfeiffer looks dazzling as the addicted wife with no inner life she succeeds in portraying the trophy 'object' navigating uncertain waters with her anti hero mary elizabeth mastrantonio happens to be the best in tony's life the only thing that is good and pure her revulsion at the end of the movie is so fiery that her whole head could have blown off robert loggia exhibits a weak and fearful disposition especially when faced with pacino as a challenger he proves to be a less ambitious boss in a position of power steven bauer shines as the man of charm loyal ally and faithful friend br br the oliver stone scripted 'scarface' is a change in genre lifting scene after scene of hawks' classic while updating the rise and fall gangster saga to modern drug infested miami but as always the focus is on decadence profanity and violenceÂmemorably a sickening chainsaw murder rather than on the psychological and social reasons for the hoodlum's psychopathic behavior
<START> i saw this when it premiered and just re watched it on ifc again this is a great telling of the many possible stories about the immigrant farmworker population that came to hawai'i to work the sugar plantations in the early 1900's my grandparents were part of that migration my parents were born on a kohala plantation big island at the time setting of the movie i moved to the big island over a year ago after living in california for over 30 years i was surprised to see that many of the former cane growing lands are still undeveloped with wild cane still growing years after the plantations closed i've heard many stories from my aunts and uncles who were kids growing up on the plantation this movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories this story is more of an historical document than a romantic plot driven movie it leaves me shaking my head to read a review like ccthemovieman's some people just don't get it br br i didn't recall that youki kudoh had the starring role with which she did an incredible job i recall her great performances in jim jarmusch's mystery train and in an australian film co starring with russell crowe heaven's burning tamlyn tomita did a great job with her pidgin english especially for someone who didn't grow up in the islands i had forgotten that toshiro mifune had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator and i missed the fact that jason scott lee had an uncredited non speaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene br br i was saddened to find out that the director and co writer kayo hatta died in an accidental drowning in 2005 br br there are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this cane plantation experience gaijin about the immigrant cane workers in brazil many of them japanese in the same time period and sugar cane alley about the cane plantation experience in africa the latter is still available but gaijin sadly doesn't appear to have been shown in quite a while another great film about the early asian in america experience when immigrants were more like slaves is a thousand pieces of gold this was set over the chinese workers' involvement in the building of the railroad starred rosalind chao chris cooper michael paul chan and dennis dun
