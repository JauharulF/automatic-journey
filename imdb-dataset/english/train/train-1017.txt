<START> i bought this film on dvd so i could get an episode of mystery science theater 3000 thankfully mike crow and tom servo are watchable because the film itself is not although there is a plot a story one can follow and a few actors that can act there isn't anything else the movie was so boring i have firmly confirmed that i will never watch it again without tom crow and mike as summarized above however it was better than the film featured in the mst3k episode that preceded it mitchell
<START> the wooden horse was one of the first great escape stories from world war ii telling the true story of eric williams and others in their escape from stalag lufft iii in october of 1943 i really like this film but had to by it on vhs from amazon in england and get it transferred from pal format in the u s i read the book when i was in hight school after having seen a portion of the film in the early 60's on t v the taunt drama of peter and john trying to escape from germany during the war is more realistic than the treck of the escapes portrayed in the great escape this film is a lost treasure that should be made more available to american audiences
<START> this move is about as bad as they come i was however forced to give it a 2 for the scenery there are many great shots of the southwest including many in monument valley one of the most breathtaking places in the us it is also starting with john ford one of the most filmed in fact one scene with kris and the girl was filmed on a place called john ford point
<START> first of all the big named actors must need the money the surgical scenes were laughable and surely they must know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this utterly absurd anesthesiologists do not leave the room during a heart transplant nor do they do the surgery in a tiny room devoid of instruments heart lung equipment and sterile techniques just a joke couldn't concentrate on the story line because of all the stupid surgery scenes no blood no personnel and then the hero doc coming in and taking over it is not a film for thinking adults also the budget must have been limited the street scenes were ok but who was the technical adviser seems like it was directed by a total idiot save your money and wait until it comes out on dvd and don't rent it
<START> first i should mention that i really enjoyed ishii katsuhito's previous film samehada otoko to momojiri onna shark skin man and peach hip girl although it owed a debt to tarentino's pulp fiction ishii's cast was up to the task of carrying the story and the entire film crackled with energy the scenes between asano tadanobu and gashuin tatsuya were particularly engaging there was action intrigue bizarre characterizations enough sex to keep things interesting and an utterly unpredictable story line br br so it was with a certain amount of anticipation and optimism that i began to watch party 7 and my enthusiasm was certainly piqued with the opening credits which left my wife and i actually stunned by how dynamic and exciting they were the mix of anime and live action work was brilliant then the actual movie started actually it didn't so much start as sort of shuffle in the side door and stand there fumbling through its pockets looking uncomfortable br br the entire film takes place in three rooms one is a futuristic voyeur's paradise borrowed a bit from shark skin man another is a travel agent's office and the third and far the most used is a seedy hotel room in that room a cast of seven characters meets and does approximately nothing really i'm no stranger to talking films one of my all time favorites is my dinner with andre the talkiest of all talking films my dinner with andre is far more exciting and it just has two middle aged men discussing their lives over dinner the key is that andre gregory and wallace shawn tell interesting stories the cast of party 7 literally just whine at each other for the entire film no you don't yes i do no you really don't yes i really do no you really really don't yes i really you get the idea i hope i wish the directer had br br party 7 is an unbelievably unengaging film there is only the flimsiest of plots money stolen from the yakuza just like in shark skin man accompanied by almost no action there is no interesting dialog the characters are largely uninteresting it was as if ishii took the throwaway conversational moments from tarentino's films and built an entire film around them but tarentino's conversations always have their own internal logic and wit they call it a 'royale with cheese' not so with the dialog here which is duller than you can imagine if it weren't for the brief hilarious cameo from gashuin who is always marvelous and a low key performance from the awesome asano tadanobu i would've given party 7 a single star it really was chore to make it all the way through
<START> roy rogers stars as jesse james and his look alike gambler man clint burns george gabby hayes is mr rogers's ex pal sheriff gabby gale storm jane fillmore and sally payne polly morgan are a noteworthy team as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero br br of course mistaken identity impersonation is a plot development since rogers essays a dual role rogers is charming as usual but there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary any potential to deliver a memorable jekyll hyde performance is done in by poor material the better pair to watch are ms storm and ms paye as the st louis journal reporters they are the film's highlight the songs are fine though badly synched br br jesse james at bay 1941 joseph kane roy rogers george 'gabby' hayes gale storm
<START> 3lbs is obviously just a self indulgent programme for stanley tucci to be a producer moody deep doctor unlike house he has absolutely no personality and unlike grey's anatomy the brain surgery cases are't even interesting this programme is supposed to be set in a leading centre for neurlogical cases yet there's nothing interesting or exciting going on not even the so called pathetic 'feud' between him and a rival adds anything to the show and neither do those hallucinations in the pilot there was a brief glimpse into the leads's social life as a father snooze boring and pointless br br this show is pants there's a glut of medical dramas around at the moment and this does nothing to make it stand out as special
<START> there are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious political and societal means not to diminish the films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights as well as wage inequality and marginalization in society all in the name of allah or god or some other ridiculous justification but sometimes it is helpful to just take another approach and shed some light on the subject br br the setting is the 2006 match between iran and bahrain to qualify for the world cup passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to get into the match br br the women who were caught played by sima mobarak shahi shayesteh irani ayda sadeqi golnaz farmani and mahnaz zabihi and detained for prosecution provided a funny and illuminating glimpse into the customs of this country and most likely all muslim countries their interaction with the iranian soldiers who were guarding and transporting them both city and villagers and the father who was looking for his daughter provided some hilarious moments as we thought about why they have such unwritten rules br br it is mainly about a paternalistic society that feels it has to save it's women from the crude behavior of it's men rather than educating the male population they deny privilege and rights to the women br br seeing the changes in the soldiers responsible and the reflection of iranian society it is nos surprise this film will not get any play in iran but jafar panahi has a winner on his hands for those able to see it
<START> i never saw it on tv but rented the dvd through netflix as soon as i found that it was available i had high expectations and was not disappointed it's funny and the animation is excellent that level of quality i would only have expected from feature films so i'm surprised at some of the bad comments on it maybe the dvd release had improved animation one bonus to the dvd is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot i'm an adult and i really appreciate that it is for adults it isn't only kids who like cute animated characters it is nowhere near raunchy as some have claimed but i can see where some parents wouldn't want their young children to see it i'm very disappointed that it was cancelled i wish they would produce more episodes or perhaps a movie
<START> 9 10 30 minutes of pure holiday terror okay so it's not that scary but it sure is fun br br the crypt keeper john kassir tales a tale of holiday fear giving us all christmas goose gossebumps that is bwahahahahha you should really be careful what you axe santa for have a scary christmas and a happy new fear okay i'll stop br br okay so in the story a greedy wife best screamer in the world mary ellen trainor kills her husband marshall bell the coach who gets towel whipped to death in anoes 2 for the money but her plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a santa suit larry dr giggles drake comes her way br br if you look it up on youtube you can watch it for free but most of you have already seen this my third viewing but if you haven't seen it i suggest you do
<START> during the cheap filmed in video beginning of crazy fat ethel ii i wondered if it was the same film that was on the cover unfortunately it was the story itself is mindlessly simple ethel a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder is released into a halfway house because of hospital overcrowding she is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into another's soup ethel is then teased by one of the halfway house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits on the cost cutting measure of feeding the residents dog food ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire noose on the stairs and then well you get the idea if this all sounds like fun it isn't this film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting the characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should be standing out in front of a cigar store to make matters worse half of the film consists of flashbacks to the first ethel movie criminally insane which is little better a very poor effort
<START> this is a way cool fantasy movie one of my faves it really is so cool the director is bernard rose who went on to direct candyman he made a great start with this film br br the film about a girl called anna who falls ill with glandular fever on her 11th birthday she draws a house on a shred of paper from her exercise book and falls into a dream in which the house is real each subsequent dream that she has is altered by the presence of whatever she adds to the picture in her third dream she meets a boy she thinks she has created called mark she befriends him and their relationship becomes stronger as the dreams become darker and scarier br br charlotte burke who plays anna is a terrific actress and it is very strange that after just one film she should disappear and never be in anything ever again she really does give a great performance in this film br br hans zimmer's score is also ace much like broken arrow the music is ghostly and mysterious it's a real shame that the soundtrack is not available on cd anymore the dvd is available in r2 only
<START> because if i was i may have wished it was me being crucified on a wooden cross i'm still trying to determine the plot of this movie and i'm being generous that there was even a plot to begin with as previously mentioned it's a misnomer on the cover of the dvd that richard dreyfuss is actually the star he was barely in the movie and if he was indeed frustrated as the back cover indicated he was well that's probably because he said yes to be in this disaster of a movie and couldn't get out of it the movie really seemed to focus on jared martin and what his role in the movie was supposed to be other than the extreme close ups was not as big of a mystery as to what gene barry's role actually was or wasn't and speaking of big whomever had the bright idea to fit gene barry in the humpty dumpty attire which showcased his trousers literally pulled up to his chin should be sentenced to hard time by watching this movie stoned sober i could go on and on about how horrendous this movie was from the dialogue not matching the actors' mouths think clutch cargo to the erratic jumping from scene to scene again being generous even calling the frames of pictures scenes to the lack of a plot however if you're into bad early 70s genre and if you're in a cottage in michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of kid cat pictures i recommend having a good bottle of wine before you embark on this weird ride of a movie because you'll be thankful that you may not remember it the next day
<START> i usually read reviews before i watch a movie guess what i didn't do that before watching tlb and i have to say i was very surprised to see the above average rating at imdb i found it to have a total lack of story you just get dropped into it and sadly not in the way saving private ryan dropped us into the movie and it also has a sudden end which was very unsatisfying for me br br i have to admit the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me especially with the low budget in mind but prepare yourself to have a laugh some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are olympic gymnasts a mid air corkscrew or somersault during ww i is a bit too much for me especially when it's performed countless times during the movie br br but the parts that really got me laughing until i almost cried were the scenes containing close combat the screaming and shouting german voices unbelievably funny it seems as if they are spoken by one single actor voice performer because they all sound exactly the same and it just sounds like a 'typical' german voice br br i would absolutely not recommend this movie to anyone except to people who just want to have some laughs because of the sad and corny quality of it
<START> i was so glad i came across this short film i'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across so when i saw this and saw that it was nominated for the live action short film at the academy awards i was so pleased that i actually had a film that i was rooting for br br the plot is pretty simple the director writer and star nacho vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals the result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy br br it's a well made short film well edited and the actors all do a great job and the last shot of the film is perfect br br i highly recommend this film
<START> for the lt to have chosen this one first the film wasn't horrible it was just hollywood worst case i need this to happen or we have no movie scenario if willis' mission was to save the doctor but she was adamant that her people make it out of the missionary he would have put her on that first chopper and marched those refugees to the border without her he would not have compromised his package for the refugees that's not how it works but as i pointed out this is hollywood we must have drama this is why we make movies because reality isn't quite so complicated however i did think that willis and the good doctor had workable chemistry that said there are also some well done battle scenes in the film it's not a waste of time tears of the sun is worth the dvd rental fee check it out on a rainy day and you'll be satisfied
<START> this is really really bad lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job but what makes it worth watching is the scene where oj angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric i got the evidence on you makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics attributed to david gregoli and leslie oren but i couldn't find it on itunes talk about seeing into the future too funny for words the rest of the movie is forgettable the score and songs are more interesting than the script ditto the sequel which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all my understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these b movies doesn't say much for the world's viewing habits
<START> before seeing this movie i was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on ideas from the book instead it's the book interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the different illnesses that didn't bother me much but it hindered my enjoyment of the film one story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable in my opinion if you're going to base a movie on a psychology text you've got to find a more interesting and preferably accurate text than this one the film drags during parts where it's little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology and would be utterly intolerable if it weren't sexual in nature because sex interesting for most of us even me luckily there are several stories with actual character development that pull us in br br but disappointingly krafft ebing's theories of sexuality went unchallenged for the most part i was hoping it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology which is still held by many to this day br br so in the end what do you have a detailed catalog of a few fetishes and orientations with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of a few sexual deviants before they are cured for most of the film the film moves with the crawling speed and mood of a wake and as an obviously low budget film the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier although i was pleased with the music costume and interior design br br i felt this film's subject was right up my alley and i still feel it's a below average film it deserves a 3 10 a 4 10 if i were feeling extremely generous i can't imagine anyone enjoying this if they didn't already have an interest in sexual fetishism
<START> there are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set that 70's show is a great example when the show came on the air nobody really heard of kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by topher grace and ashton kushton both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests i wish topher would stay around because the show began about his character eric and his close circle of friends ashton is already the john travolta of our time remember when john was in love with diana hyland from eight is enough think of ashton with demi moore the cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it i miss mo gaffney who played don's girlfriend joanne i miss lisa robin kelly as the original laurie the replacement could not match her and i am sorry about that i liked the casting of tommy chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to steven hyde i loved watching tanya roberts besides charlie's angels i loved brooke shields playing jackie's mom she really showed her acting talent before heading to broadway this show has been a delight with many surprises i hope this show lasts longer even though 2 of their cast members are leaving but i hope they don't stay too far away too long i wish the show's creators bonnie and terry turner who also created my other favorite show third rock from the sun is more successful on fox than they were on nbc which sabotaged their show the turners are not dummies and i hope they create more shows like this in the future
<START> my husband and i are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same township as the screenwriter of this movie we were very upset that the jcc is bringing this movie to its jewish film festival because of the way that the mentally disabled character frankie is portrayed we went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out we demanded out money back we would encourage the screenwriter to donate a portion of the funds to the jcc's achad program to apologize br br we did not like seeing frankie a mentally disabled and perhaps even autistic teenager as part of a joke in which he keeps dropping something to look at the nanny's breasts br br there was no point to frankie's character other than to say hey being mentally disabled is funny challenges like frankie's are a serious matter families like mine are truly suffering br br the screenwriter needs to explain herself does she know families with disabled kids does she see the families with disabled kids week after week at the jcc pool
