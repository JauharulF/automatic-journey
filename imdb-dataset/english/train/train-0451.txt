<START> a strangely enjoyable effort combining an appropriately far fetched plot involving adam and burt and flashbacks to the original tv series most of the flashback scenes were lifted directly from burt ward's book boy wonder my life in tights and i imagine his book was the inspiration for making this movie like the book it left fans of the original series hungering for more br br if you missed this broadcast it is definitely worth the effort to borrow a tape from a friend who may have recorded it i'm making a copy for my kids right now
<START> cor blimey this film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece billy zane is stunning as the central character and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy br br the soundtrack is really good and the set pieces are a joy to behold i recommend that you watch this film with a bunch of mates a few bottles of your liquor of choice and prepare to be astonished and highly entertained br br this carries on so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like plan 9 from outer space that it is in the true b movie tradition but what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film ron pearlman for example i still find my self giggling at the scene where zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style all a bit mad and all the better for it
<START> i really liked this movie it was good and the actors were brilliant leon robinson who played richard and many other classic singers is very good at his job when you see him in a musical movie you know that it is going to be good i would suggest that people watch this heart warming sad and special movie if they want to know more about richard outstanding fresh
<START> i almost never comment on movies but i saw the 5 glowing reviews of this movie and decided i had to weigh in with my own review an instructor of mine received this film in the mail mixed in with his academy screeners ampas aka the guys who vote on the oscars and was so floored with how terribly constructed this movie was that he brought it in to our class to demonstrate to us how not to put together a movie br br this film has no plot the scenes are horribly horribly edited oftentimes using faux 24 style picture in picture techniques and the performances particularly the lead who even fails at acting like a bad actress are for the most part obnoxious someone truly failed to understand the point of an introduction namely the setting up of the plot there is no setup halfway through the movie neither myself nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was supposed to be about the opening crane shot which sets up some kind of murder is never addressed and now that i think about it was possibly meant to be a flash forward with the rest of the film being a flashback but it cuts from that scene directly to the next without any indication as such br br bah i could really go on and on at the very least this movie gives me renewed confidence in my own film making ability
<START> one of the joys of picking up the recent bela lugosi collection is getting to see delightful movies like the invisible ray boris karloff and bela lugosi team up in a movie that delves into meteorites and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd especially the camera technique karloff as janos rukh uses to determine the site of a certain meteorite and downright laughable i didn't care in the lease because the movie is thoroughly enjoyable the effects are done well for the time the acting is great and the finish is particularly strong it reminds me of the pulp sci fi comics and novels of the 1940s and '50s complete with ray guns and ridiculous science you must watch this movie
<START> when a film is independent and not rated such as the hamiltons i was expecting out of the norm cut out your heart violence i know that good movies don't always contain blood and violence but i read reviews i visited the website and i even convinced a few of my friends to pay 9 50 to see this god awful movie with me when there is a festival called horrorfest i am expecting horror not dawsons creek with incestuous undertones my expectations were extremely low for this film yet the little expectations there was for the film were shot to hell once i saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood come out of someones finger there were too many plot holes and left too much to the imagination i regret not seeing happy feet i think there might have been more violence and gore in that movie than in the hamiltons
<START> the often misunderstood zabriskie point is antonioni's political film antonioni's american film stylistically it follows suit after blow up meaning that the pace is faster than the previous epics though certainly no less idiosyncratic br br basically the common mistake is that the film glorifies the hippie generation not so br br the two protagonists come from vastly different environments mark from the rebel youths daria from an estate agency corporation but in true antonioni fashion they are both alienated both trying to escape their surroundings mark leaves a meeting of rebel students and black panthers disappointed with the verbose empty rhetoric while daria keeps uneasily being on the move with her car br br antionioni the master director after portraying the rebelling youth as confused and shallow then moves to the city an environment saturated by corporatism billboard advertisements meaninglessness that has to keep expanding to accommodate the similar expansion of the population generating a profit at the same time it is this environment that the two protagonists escape from though it seems mostly out of coincidence br br indeed when daria stops by a small village in the outskirts of the desert the environment is just as suffocating and the people just as lost cases best exemplified by an old boxing champion now reduced to a shadow of himself sitting around drinking and smoking and talking nonsense a stunning melancholy sequence made even more powerful with the inclusion of some half wild children living around brought in by some benefactor but destroying a genuine piece of american history in a not so obscure symbolism there is antonioni's opinion on the hippies just a half positive glimpse in the canvas of human alienation br br and then there is the desert the landscape used to devastating effect by turns pure and terrifying primeval wild and dead the sequence where the two protagonists make love joined in fantasy by the flower generation reflects the similar sequence in red desert where giuliana tells her son a story it is a colourful intermission in a colourless landscape a vivid half fantasy in a suffocating reality br br the ending probably belongs to the pantheon of great endings in cinema the western civilization blown to pieces a catharsis an exorcism br br antionioni's two international films the british blow up and the american zabriskie point are lesser efforts than the previous masterpieces but that is largely because of the faster pace and the inevitably contrived settings swinging london flower power america but when it comes down to it it's clear he hasn't lost the edge
<START> this is a great ending to the show the fact that adm janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great the fact that she allowed herself to be infected thus infecting the queen with a poison that in essence ended the borg was great the way they ended it also left some not a lot for a reunion movie however they did bring them home and the way they did it was fantastic it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family ending it with tom and b'lanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad was a great way to show a new beginning it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type just to see where their characters would be today
<START> this film is to my mind the weakest film in the original star wars trilogy for a variety of reasons however it emerges at the end of the day a winner despite all its flaws it's still a very good film even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments br br one problem here is the look of the film which isn't very consistent with the other 2 films i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary kurtz the first 2 films have that dirty lived in look with all the technology and so forth in jedi on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned this makes for a much less textured film also the creatures were excessively muppet like and cutesy at this point it seems like the film makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself br br another aspect is its lack of originality where star wars created a whole new experience in cinema and empire brought us to alien worlds of swamps ice and clouds jedi lamely re cycled the locations of the first film first we are back on the desert planet tatooine and then we are watching them face another death star maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new but you'd think lucas or kasdan could also we have these ewoks who really are just detestable made for mattel teddy bears in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie fight at the end of star wars if they hadn't run out of cash it just feels like lazy construction br br the most unfortunate aspect of jedi for me is the weak handling of the han solo character whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time trading one liners with the droids instead of a real drama we're stuck with the lame pretense that han is still convinced leia loves luke as if the conclusion of empire where she confessed her love of him had never happened the whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the solo character was not part of this film's central story after his rescue ford for his part looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances this is more like a 1990s ford performance bored and looking above the film itself fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes lando an interesting character introduced in empire here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle only hamill given an interesting development in the luke character is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package ian mcdiarmid does excellent work as well as the emperor the film would sink if he had been too far over the top as he was at times in the new films br br visually and in terms of effects work other than the clean look of everything it's hard to find fault jabba is a very effective animatronic character one of the most elaborate ever constructed the space battles towards the end are very impressive br br ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears but on its own it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of lucas' later productions
<START> legendary movie producer walt disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen they remain among the most popular animated films of all time the first was his groundbreaking classic snow white and the seven dwarfs released in 1937 the last was the then under appreciated sleeping beauty which made it's debut in 1959 in between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale cinderella 1950 of the three films cinderella is the one most faithful to its origins ironically unlike snow white which for better or worse became for many the definitive version of the story cinderella did not follow the same path although it was a hit and like snow white was responsible for restoring the dwindling disney fortunes it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved disney for once did himself proud electing not to tamper with a classic instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale rather than rewriting it for the screen the result was enchanting br br a combination of superb animation in beautifully soft technicolor and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day ilene woods who was a radio performer recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material al hoffman mack david and jerry livingston when disney heard them he knew he had found his cinderella and indeed he had woods heartfelt renditions of a dream is a wish your heart makes so this is love and oh sing sweet nightingale are perfect eleanor audley who would go on to voice maleficent in sleeping beauty masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother while rhoda williams and lucille bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters luis van rooten admirably performed as both the king and the grand duke and james macdonald was endearing as both jaq and gus cinderella's devoted mice william phipps has little dialog as the prince future talk show host mike douglas provided his singing voice but film and disney veteran verna felton was born to play the fairy godmother and she made the best number the oscar nominated bibbidi bobbidi boo her own show stopper br br among the artists responsible for the look of the film was mary blair whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by disney her elegant french period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie but most important of all' are the believable characters from cinderella right down to lucifer the stepmother's deliciously evil cat they bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story something very difficult to create in an animated film br br in conjunction with the film's 55 year anniversary and not so coincidentally the coming holiday season cinderella has just been released on a special edition dvd it simply has never looked better the fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated suffice it to say it looks wonderful an enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added and serves the music well the dvd extras now a standard part of disney platinum editions are too numerous to list here but as usual some are directed towards children some are slanted to adults and the rest fall somewhere in between but real fans will want to get the deluxe gift set because along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches it includes a 160 page hardback book which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release but much more as well as usual for disney cinderella will only be available for a limited time so if like me you are a cinderella lover get it now this edition is truly a dream come true
<START> i just saw the third week of stephen kings' nightmares and dreamscapes mini series meaning i saw 6 episodes so far i have to say that the stories are really weak i have read stephen king's skeleton crew a collection of his short stories that was published way back i recall most of the stories were average to poor but there was one that was really excellent if not outstanding br br what i'm trying to say is that just because this mini series is from a collection of stories from stephen king does not mean that it will be any good in fact if his previous collection of short stories are of any indication then most of this mini series will be average to poor br br in stephen king's defense i have not read these new short stories perhaps they are good as stories in a book and not readily adaptable to television or perhaps it was the fault of the scriptwriters in trying to write an interesting script who knows also these short stories may have been made exclusively for this mini series and not not for print purpose maybe that may have been the problem if stephen king had submitted these crap stories to an editor i am sure the editor would have immediately told him to make it more interesting because as is it is simply boring br br what is clear from all of this is that the problem is with the stories script and not the actors and actresses because this mini series has some excellent people acting on it br br seeing this mini series really makes me appreciate those old twilight zone series each series was only half an hour but it was compelling and riveting i don't understand why this mini series could not accomplish similar feat i am sure this mini series had a good deal of money to make a good mini series but unfortunately something must not have clicked br br for instance this week there were two episodes shown the first involved a horror story writer who buys a picture drawn by an artist who committed suicide the writer begins to see changes in the picture as he is driving homeward feeling uncomfortable he throws away the painting but it keeps appearing near him also the portrait of an individual in that picture is killing people and is out to kill him i will not even mention the second episode for this week involving criminals and their loot because it was even more boring than this episode br br this premise is interesting and so the story should be good but after seeing it i was frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story as well as extraneous materials that was shown that did nothing to help the story after the last scene i was left with more questions than answers br br i tried for 3 weeks to get into this mini series but it was just too aggravating due to poor stories script if this was a movie i would have recommended that people should wait for the movie to come out on cable or such i would not even recommend that it be rented in your video store however given that this is on tnt a cable channel i would say if you have not seen it already then try it for one week if you do not like it that week then you will not like the past series nor the future ones since they all share the same boring trait
<START> surprised to see the rather low score for this movie just saw this film for the first time in 10 years and was reminded why i like it br br come back with me children to a time when michael keaton was a straight up comedy guy and you might find some joy in this film it's a gentle comedy the kind ron howard specializes in but if that's your thing you should check this out keaton's low key charm is just right for this project br br gung ho is a bit dated because it takes places in the last stage of the pre global economy world when it still mattered what country a business was based in that said it delivers laughs as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other to great benefit br br you could watch this film and enjoy it without remembering one scene in particular you really liked but that's because the whole movie provides a slow but constant stream of laughs it's like an i v drip and i mean that in a good way
<START> i wish kids movies were still made this way dark and deep there was get this character development and charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character plot development superb animation emotional involvement and a rational relatable and consistent theme if not for the handful of song and dance routines you would never have thought this was a kids movie and this is why i give it such a high rating this movie is an excellent film let alone for a kids' movie which brings me to my second point this has got to be the darkest kids' movie i've seen in quite some time this coming from a 22 year old i'd be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever come across ala jurassic bark for those of you who are 'futurama' fans and this is what makes this movie so good just because the movie universally evokes emotions we don't normally like to feel and assume are bad does not make the movie itself bad in fact it means it succeeded good funny movies are supposed to make us laugh good horror movies are supposed to make us scared good sad movies are supposed to make us sad my point is good movies are supposed to move you not simply entertain this movie moved me br br also this movie is incredibly violent by today's standards for a kids' movie and contains subject matter that by today's standards may not be suitable for some children parents i'd say watch it first i'm not usually one to say anything about this kind of thing but i just saw this yesterday and it came as a surprise even to me
<START> if you like jamie foxx alvin sanders date from hell '01 you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with shrimp jumbo size and at the same time lots of gold bars alvin sanders has plenty of fbi eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw and david morse edgar clenteen hack '02 tv series decides to zero in on poor alvin and use him as a so called fish hook to attract the criminals there is lots of laughs drama cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the junk yard jamie foxx and david morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture
<START> well after three times through i still have no idea what this movie is about because quite honestly it failed to generate any real interest or concern but here it goes a bunch of too old to be teen teen actors dressed in horrifying latter 1980's fashions did we look like that too decide it would be a really good idea to get in a motorboat and go visit the abandoned alcatraz after one of them has nightmares of people being slaughtered in various horrifying ways that manage to rip off poltergeist the evil dead and freddy kreuger in one fell swoop the dimwit even envisions himself being roasted over an open fire with some deformed freak slicing off strips of tenderloin good thing it was only a dream or it might have hurt and good thing his dreams had a decent special effects budget mine are usually pretty lame girls model space ships blowing things up with a bazooka etc br br once on the alcatraz island they find themselves in a slasher movie and meet up with tony basil who cannot help but break into a couple dance poses at times and had her own lighting crew complete with a smoke machine for that 1980's smoky haze infused light look which i kind of miss and such reminded me that ms basil helped choreograph david byrne of the talking heads for some of his videos and performances this of course has nothing at all to do with the film but kept popping into mind as the movie posed very little to actually think about it sort of happens and you can either watch or keep working on your page markup with it on the tv set off to the side but since the film isn't really interesting you'll keep deciding to finish one last thing instead of wasting time the movie will keep ending and you'll find yourself wondering what you missed every time you realize the end credits are starting to roll again dammit br br some 1980's teen horror movies can survive such specialized viewing umberto lenzi's ghosthouse chopping mall it's killbots the hard to ignore night of the creeps and the over the top sleepaway camp all come to mind they are films that like them or not demand your attention and usually pay off with some good gore or t a and typos in your work as evidence that you were watching the tv instead of your keyboard i am sure that hell island as the british version i glommed onto is titled does indeed have some good stuff in there but frankly i don't care and nothing is more annoying that encountering art of any genre that doesn't inspire admiration some decent dislike or even good old honest hatred for it the film is content with simpering away 80 whatever minutes of time and never really accomplishing anything more than being a sometimes distraction in spite of my best efforts to try and give it a chance but no dice br br there is some offbeat production design going on the use of lighting is striking at times and the occasional outburst of mayhem will probably keep fans of 1980's teen horror interested the rest of you be warned though you will wonder if you dressed like that in 1987 and the answer is probably more hideous than anything which happens on screen try to watch it as a free rental if possible so that if disappointed you aren't stuck with the damn thing movies like this take up valuable shelf space that is often at a commodity these days what with the world coming to an end all
<START> well you'd better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish bland and pokey flick about a middle aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like set in tunis mom piddles around the flat gets antsy and decides albeit reluctantly she just can't help herself to don the costume and dance in a local cabaret meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons the common denominator is a tunisian band drummer this film is so full of filler i watched the dvd at x2 and read the subtitles fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking they walk everywhere and more walking and just plain dawdling at x4 just to get though this boring uneventful low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits go figure c
<START> ivan marco ricca and gilberto alexandre borges are partners in a company together with estevÃo george freire but the first ones contract a professional killer anisio to murder estevÃo the plot at least at the beginning doesn't explain very well why the guy does it and after receiving his money he starts blackmailing the two partners appearing in their company and saying he wants a job there as supervisor or somethingÂ at the same time he meets marina mariana ximenes daughter of estevÃo and starts dating with her br br in a story like this where crime corruption betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand no one is innocent or can be victimized exception made to marina which is the only person who doesn't know what's going on and didn't betray anyoneÂ br br this film portrays with sarcasm the sad and cruel reality which exists in big metropolis like sÃ£o paulo where crime is every day's presence we can feel irony but also veracity in characters like anisio brilliantly played by paulo miklos which does blackmail to the guys who paid him without any scruples and even flirts with the daughter of the guy he killed he really must be a monster to do something like that but of course i know there're people like him out there in brazil or any other placeÂ br br it's a very good movie cruel but truthful about a sad realityÂ the acting is great and the soundtrack too
<START> seriously there is absolutely nothing good about this crap fest at all randolph scott a closet homosexual who lived with his lover cary grant for twelve years is at his most wooden and boring in the least role at 57 he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles although it doesn't matter so much here because gail russell looks so much older than her 31 years and she is so ugly due to her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking lee marvin plays his usual villainous role but it isn't enough to save this garbage thank god they don't make westerns any more they're just dated racist old movies that glamorise guns and murder br br 0 10
<START> i first saw this in the movie theater when it came out and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun this is a great cast of characters many big names in it a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now i think it's a great idea if you follow any of these actors or have loved them in other movies to add it to your watched list some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of well done comedy as in the birdcage or even the clue kind of odd spontaneous appearing comedy with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors the movie did a great job at giving you some insight perhaps even very realistic into the culture of a daytime soap
<START> mae clarke will always be remembered as the girl whose face james cagney showed a grapefruit into in the same year's the public enemy she will not be remembered for this weird little story about a a hood's girl who finds that her past will always be with her br br in some ways this looks a bit antique for 1931 almost as if you are looking at 1928's famously inert lights of new york but don't be fooled although ted tetzlaff's photography is still in the big scenes there's lots of movement indicating distraction to the moviegoers in the set ups to them but in competition with the fast paced stuff that it seems that everyone was doing at warner's this attempt to bring the woman's viewpoint into the genre as a tearjerker doesn't work nor is mae clarke the actress to carry the effort
