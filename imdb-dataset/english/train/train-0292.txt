<START> this film offers absolutely no imagination in it's premise nor in it's execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so called comedy that has no energy to speak of story is about nit picky over analytical insurance risk manager reuben feffer ben stiller who finds his new wife lisa debra messing cheating on him with a scuba instructor hank azaria after only one day on their honeymoon upon returning home reuben and his best friend sandy philip seymour hoffman go to a party and run into polly prince jennifer aniston whom they went to school with years earlier br br spoiler alert polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree which is the opposite of who reuben is as a person but they start to date and reuben starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods but one day lisa comes back and wants to remain married to reuben but he really doesn't want to but polly decides to leave as she doesn't believe in marriage to begin with br br this film is the second directing effort by john hamburg who wrote two generally unfunny screenplays in zoolander and meet the parents but those two films seem like classics compared to this stale piece of drivel it's very easy to say something is not funny but i think with this film it's even easier to figure out why this film is totally and utterly predictable from start to finish with every scene looking as if it's only happening because of the ridiculousness of the script hamburg who also wrote the script seems to have written this without any thought of trying something different and at times he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as there's something about mary but instead the events seem incredibly forced did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny if you do your easy a few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is overstating the obvious stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the better scripts to come his way because this film doesn't work as a comedy or as a romance
<START> this movie was long and boring surprising that it was selected for cannes although they tend to like pretentiousness point is that contrary to other dutch stars of the arty genre like kerkhof and kruishoop guernsey feels utterly empty even more so it has no cinematic quality whatsoever a long opening shot doesn't mean cinematic depth it's just a long boring shot the story wasn't interesting and the characters had problems i couldn't identify with at all the actors didn't shine under her direction and seemed lost at times leopold tried but she is not the talent i hoped she would be where are kerkhof and kruishoop they really made some waves in dutch cinema leopold just made another attempt
<START> scooby doo is undoubtedly one of the most simple successful and beloved cartoon characters in the world so what happens when you've been everywhere and done everything with the formula you switch it up right wrong you stop production and let it rest for a decade or so and then run it again keeping the core of its success intact that is to say stick with the formula for the most part but add your particular flavour to it this to me is why what's new scooby doo worked they want back to the classic scooby doo formula which had only successfully resurfaced a decade earlier in a pup named scooby doo but for the most part had not been tapped since the original scooby doo where are you br br the first sign to me of a weak offering is the inclusion of extraneous characters there might be a few fond memories from past iterations but generally if you think scooby doo you aren't thinking of film flam scrappy doo or scooby dum even worse the exclusion of the other core members of mystery inc generally indicate a group of production people who don't understand from a kids point of view how the show works the basic premise has always been a group of people who are diametrically opposed getting together and through their own individual stereotyped qualities manage to surmount the tasks given at hand br br this next paragraph is just my theorizing so skip it if you want i hope that i can explain why i think fiddling around with the basic elements of the show are detrimental with my interpretation of what the gang represents and how they contribute to the whole fred represents the driver i think in general it is the purpose of fred to give the group direction organization and sub tasks fred isn't a happy go lucky teenager he's your boss your teacher your dad your authority figure fred moves without hesitation and is driven by tasks problem always equals solution for fred in many ways fred is the antithesis to shaggy shaggy is your best friend that guy who is just a little more afraid of things than you are he enables you to be brave to not be at the back of the pack shaggy represents emotion and is frequently showing emotional extremes from elation to fear velma represents rational thought she applies logic but as we see time and again on the show she requires clues that for the most part are collected in pieces by the other members of the show left on her own would velma solve a mystery the group often finds itself in situations where truths aren't obvious and only through chance encounters do they achieve the necessary information to complete their task chance is represented by daphne at one point i think it is the first scooby doo series she was known as danger prone writers have used daphne to link unrelated events together through accident she frequently is the one who finds the secret door collection of objects or some other detail that can help the gang link clues together finally scooby himself represents us the participant he is always in the centre of events capable of all the things the rest of the gang are capable of yet handicapped because he is not human and much like us the television viewer is unable to truly participate scooby doo works because all these personified elements of problem solving are immediately identifiable and entertaining br br maybe i'm over thinking things but in my life i've seen a lot of scooby doo being a 30 year old self proclaimed nerd it kind of rolls with the territory to me there is a magic with the classic scooby doo formula that should never be messed with br br as many have pointed out scooby doo is not a great work of art nor is it completely trite it falls into the category of programming that can be watched by young eyes with a hearty bowl of breakfast cereal messing about with the raw simplicity transforms it into something else something lesser
<START> in an otherwise ghastly misbegotten would be oedipal comedy br br i was the lone victim at a 7 20 screening tonight 3 days after the movie opened so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings br br the bloom is off jon heder's rose the emerging double chin isn't his fault but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig simply isn't working it would be another crime if this were to be eli wallach's last screen appearance diane keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck basically because so few will have seen her in this the very worst vehicle she's chosen in the last few weeks br br sitting alone in the theater tonight i came alive laughed even whenever daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the film's sole three dimensional character he really is among our very best actors br br in summary even jeff daniels's work can't redeem this picture
<START> this amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of the brave women in cameroun's judicial system policewomen lawyers and judges despite tremendous difficulties lack of means the desperate poverty of the people multiple languages and multiple legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants these brave strong women are making a difference br br this is a rare thing a truly inspiring movie that restores a little bit of faith in humankind despite the atrocities we see in the movie justice does get served thanks to these passionate hardworking women br br i only hope this film gets a wide release in the united states the more people who see this film the better
<START> homicide the movie proved to be a good wrap up to a well written well directed and well acted series loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season the entire series and especially the movie provided a life like look at life and death in baltimore a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate my attraction to the series began long before i moved to baltimore but once i experienced life here for myself i realized how realistic it was and the movie certainly retained that spirit i will certainly miss new original episodes of the series but am very grateful to nbc and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of charm city
<START> wow what a great premise for a film set it around a film maker with writer s block who decides to take up tango lessons hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker who s interested in tango gosh i wish i had that knack for genius yes i m being sarcastic br br it amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made come on unless you re a rabid tango fan i do concede they do exist judging by the comments or a die hard member of the sally potter fan club there s nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it even if you re into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road br br coming soon the review lesson where a failed screenwriter from scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films he s seen gasp in shock as theo robertson puts the boot into the latest hollywood blockbusters weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body the review lesson coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to fund the movie br br ps sally potter is unrelated to harry potter
<START> although the production and jerry jameson's direction are definite improvements airport '77 isn't much better than airport 1975 slick commercial rubbish submerging this time literally a decent cast jack lemmon is the pilot of a packed airliner which gets hijacked by art thieves and crashes into the sea all the publicity claimed it was near the bermuda triangle but there's no mention of it in the film itself when the rescue ships come to raise the airplane out of the water we see all their cranes dropping rather blindly into the ocean and it's hard not to laugh imagining the cranes plugging the plane the passengers and the waterlogged script nbc used to air what appeared to be the director's cut with at least an hour of extra footage mostly flashbacks injected into the proceedings with all the subtlety of a gilligan's island episode most exciting moment is the plane crash and some of the players have a little fun lee grant is an obnoxious drunk brenda vaccaro a no nonsense stewardess joseph cotten and olivia de havilland are flirting oldsters still the personality conflicts and the excruciating military detail eventually tear at one's patience from
<START> if you've had drama in your life either your own or by someone close to you the stages of pain this woman but in my opinion it could easily have been a man too goes through are very very real it is a movie about not being able to cope with your pain about not knowing what to do to help yourself get through it obviously it then also is a movie about not knowing how to help someone close to you get through their pain it is a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering it is a movie that might push someone over the edge which hardly sounds like a recommendation i'm not sure i would recommend someone to go see this film especially someone close but for me it is a movie that puts things into perspective that shows real pain and is therefore much relevant to being alive it makes you realize that hey you or the person close to you have lived through pain that hey all the things you worry about now are of so little importance
<START> wow this has got to be the dumbest movie i've ever seen we watched it in english class and this movie made absolutely no sense i would never ever watch this movie again and my sympathy to those who have ever paid to see it
<START> since educating rita julie walters has been one of my role models and her performance in this as a woman who helps the man she loves get in synch with his feminine side is magnificent i would never have believed her character in the hands of a lesser actress but walters pulls it off with gusto and panache adrian pasdar gives his best performance to date in the male lead
<START> a film about wannabee's never were's and less than heroes making it against all odds where have we heard that before but when the unfortunates are the shoveller the blue raja and mr furious you know this is not your conventional rags to riches story br br a classic performance by eddie izzard as tony p one of the disco boys leaders and geoffrey rush as arch villain shows actual thought went into the casting br br even greg kinnear at first glance an odd choice for the role of captain amazing turns out spot on br br watch this film if you're sick of comic gone film stereotypes why couldn't anger be a super power
<START> this film is a massive yawn proving that americans haven't got the hang of farce even when it has already been written for them the original film hodet over vannet is a witty comedy of errors that i would rate 8 10 it isn't just about a linguistic translation but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap oops there go my trousers style of farce
<START> first an explanation on what makes a great movie for me excitement about not knowing what is coming next will make me enjoy a movie the first time i watch it case en point twister there are also other things that go into a great first viewing such as good humor john candy in uncle buck and the great outdoors good plot with good resolution madeline and matilda imaginative storytelling all star wars episodes george lucas is the man and good music again all star wars episodes wizard of oz sound of music what makes me watch a movie at least six times in the theatre and buy a dvd or vhs tape characters with that said i present cindy lou who and the grinch excellent performance taylor momsen and jim carrey the rest of the cast was very good particularly jeffery tambor bill irwin molly shannon christine baranski and josh ryan evans but every single scene with cindy and the grinch together is excellent and very funny and or heartwarming cindy lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why the movie is better than the cartoon the grinch has a strong plot good conflicts and a very good theme i can't get started because i don't want to spoil it jim carrey was very funny as the grinch particularly when he interacted with cindy and the music wow excellent music by james horner i loved his selection of instruments and the compositions very good job jim carrey i didn't know you could sing taylor momsen whoa your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once on your solo where are you christmas is your voice really as high as it sounds sounds like an f that is an obscene range for a 7 year old obscene meant in the best possible way great job this is the best performance by a child i have ever heard in a movie taylor beat out the von trapp children no small feat and now to the actors jim carrey was great funny and surprisingly very sensitive this really showed through in his scenes with taylor momsen taylor momsen's unspoken expressions one of the secrets to a good acting performance are very strong she really becomes cindy lou who and when she does dialogue she is even stronger br br danger spoiler alert br br examples expression when she first sees the grinch this is a classic quote you're the the the and then filled in with the grinch line da da da the grinch after which she topples into the sorter and then is rescued by the grinch the thanks for saving me quote and subsequent response by the grinch was also very good br br my favorite part of the movie is when cindy invites the grinch to be holiday cheermeister this scene is two excellent actors at their best interacting and expressing with each other little taylor momsen completely holds her own with jim carrey in this spot i sincerely hope we see taylor momsen in many more films to come all in all everything was great about this movie except maybe the feet and noses
<START> to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of gaslight 1939 1944 via les diaboliques 1954 while still watchable in itself it's so clichÃ© ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills however thanks to the dire straits in which the british film industry found itself in the late 1970s even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract 10 star names cliff robertson as the conniving husband jean simmons in the title role jenny agutter as robertson's artist half sister simon ward as the enigmatic chauffeur ron moody as an ill fated doctor michael jayston as robertson's business partner judy geeson as simmons' best friend and jayston's wife flora robson as the housekeeper david tomlinson as the notary reading simmons' will and most surprisingly perhaps jack warner as a gravestone sculptor although most of them actually have nothing parts i'm sorry to say
<START> whale hunters pick on the wrong freaking whale br br a group of yahoo whale exploitists capture a female and string her up by her tail fin the whale's mate sees the whole thing including the moment the female's unborn baby slips out and slops onto the deck 'captain nolan' richard harris could tell that the big male is really mad by the way it stared him down as if to say get out of town before high tide br br this story of revenge has harris' presence and bo's beauty but not much else this was bo's first 'released' film though her first acting job was four years previous in 'and once upon a love' released in 1981 as 'fantasies' directed by john derek br br p s today the date of this review november 20 is bo derek's birthday i hope bo has a 'whale' of a good time get it whale hee hee

<START> remember the early days of pay per view i do and i can almost remember the number you had to call to actually rent the movie on your t v as a kid we always wanted to rent playboy but this meant actually calling someone from ppv and asking to rent it and then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv and i remember almost every scene that was in the add i've been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the great movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them it's one that when its on its hard to shut off all star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right there are plenty of spoof bank capers that are good and this one has to fall in that category it has enough action and laughs to sustain it check it out if you dare
<START> if this could be rated a 0 it would be from the atrocious wooden acting to the dull plodding pace the puerile exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation added purely for the sake of the sad viewers this is a disaster of a film br br the plot is predictable as from the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all of the characters and how the plot will commence from a boring unexceptional beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending every single presence in this film is wasted and every meagre scrap of talent dug up for this turkey is squandered br br if you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with plenty of the same childish titillation watch one of the ilsa films at least they're unapologetic and up front about what they're trying to do how something this horrendously bad ever managed to be rated above a 5 is a miracle of how people with no taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purposes br br it's not scary it's not interesting and above all it's not arousing in any sense of the word it is in my opinion a crime it is a crime that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash was ever conceived of and given the resources to come into existence and even more a tragedy that it is still defended by some woefully misguided viewers br br not even elvira's cheerful personality and joking ways could soften the blow that this horrifying travesty of film is avoid it at all costs
<START> one of frances farmer's earliest movies at 22 she is absolutely beautiful bing crosby is in great voice but the songs are not his best martha raye and bob burns are interesting but their comedy probably great in its time is really corny today roy rogers also appears in a singing role in my view only worth watching if you are a frances farmer fan and possibly a bing crosby fan
