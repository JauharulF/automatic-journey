<START> wwe armageddon december 17 2006 live from richmond coliseum richmond va br br kane vs mvp in an inferno match so this is the fourth ever inferno match in the wwe and it is kane vs mvp wonder why was it the first match on the card i only viewed the ending parts where kane sets mvp's ass on fire as they're on the apron and then mvp is running around the arena while yelling Â eventually the refs put out the fire with a fire extinguisher as mvp sprawls around the entrance ramp funny and visually quite entertaining ending 7 10 br br wwe tag team championship this was originally supposed to be william regal dave taylor vs brian kendrick paul london c in a regular tag team match however gm teddy long comes to the ring and announces that it's going to be a fatal 4 way tag team ladder match mnm and the hardys are thrown in and it's all chaos one word to describe this eye opener Â wow man i really can't remember how many sick spots there were in this match and words can't really do it justice there was one particularly notable spot where the hardys set up a ladder in a see saw position and jeff jumped off the top rope while matt held mnm for the kill and then wham nitro blew away while mercury apparently botched it and was bleeding like hell with lacerations over his face he had to be taken away and nitro continued the match alone another spot was when jeff powerbombed london while flipping off the ladder there were other high flying breathtaking spots too many to remember london finally unbuckles the belts to win this rave show stealer 8 5 10 br br the boogeyman vs the miz the two men get thrown in and around the ring until boogeyman explodes a sit out powerbomb for the victory and then and drools worms over the miz's mouth as usual 5 5 10 for this three minute incognito br br united states championship chris benoit c faces off chavo guerrero in yet another typical guerrero match some good spots included a superplex off the top rope by chavo and an unusually long chain of german suplexes by benoit vicki guerrero comes in the ring with the belt to nail benoit but benoit scares her off and takes a long time deciding whether to put her in a sharpshooter or not this allows chavo to go for a roll up but benoit rolls it up once more and chavo is locked in the sharpshooter game over nice hard fought battle albeit slow at times 7 10 br br wwe cruiserweight championship gregory helms c vs jimmy wang yang for this one in a fairly moderate paced match the match had some good high flying spots Â most notably helms' moves off the top rope Â but the crowd didn't seem to be into it after witnessing the ladder match and yang needs to get more airborne helms won the match after blowing yang away with a facebuster on the knee 7 5 10 br br the undertaker vs mr kennedy in a last ride match after a series of matches between these two this time it is a last ride match the second ever of its kind and the winner has to escort his opponent out of the arena in a hearse pretty good indeed for what these two could offer kennedy manhandled a good deal of taker and even broke free of a chokeslam to throw taker off the armageddon set about 15 feet below and thank god for kennedy otherwise it would've been brutal kennedy almost got the win until taker got back up inside the hearse i liked the camera view inside the hearse taker then missed a steel pipe hurl on kennedy and broke the hearse's window instead but then later busted kennedy open with a chair and followed with a consecutive chokeslam and tombstone on the hearse's roof kennedy was unconscious and taker drove him out of the arena to win i actually found myself really interested into these guys' willingness to take give real sick shots 7 5 10 br br santa comes into the ring i go what the hell like many of the kids in the crowd and then the word lingerie contest gets in my ear break time br br batista john cena vs finlay king booker talk about charisma vs technicality this match was actually a quite good main event with the momentum rationally shifting from one team to the other and retaining good suspense even finlay got some legitimate good shots on his opponents this time i kind of doubted his strength against the champs and him and booker mainly didn't succeed in trying to cheat Â except at one point where booker rammed his scepter into cena's throat batista hits the bomb on booker for the win didn't get to see the f u cena performed the 5 knuckle shuffle anyhow and i think he also did the stfu this was probably the best technical match of the night and the participants did superbly indeed for what they could without a ladder 7 5 10 br br being an on and off wwe fan i have to agree that armageddon was laced up with numerous eye catchers throughout and the ladder match ultimately swallowed half of the show the last ride match featured some fairly nerve wrenching spots and the main event also did very well for its category all other matches also lived up to their billing except perhaps the boogeyman vs the miz bout and the ever useless lingerie contest overall armageddon was a highly enjoyable pay per view and despite some big setbacks earlier in the ppv chronology armageddon wishes this year's goodbye respectably ppv rating 8 10
<START> i am a huge charlton heston fan he is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time but what was he thinking when he made this movie normally if he made a bad movie i could blame it on the screenwriter or director but in this case it's all him the suckiness of this movie is all his fault it proves that not even heston can make a shakespeare story interesting i wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this snooze fest and i'll never get that time back this is by far the worst heston movie that i've ever seen if you are a shakespeare fan maybe you'll find this movie entertaining but if you're not don't waste your time you'll regret it in the long run
<START> potential spoilers br br man this movie was awful a catholic superstitious suspense thriller it goes over already well tread ground from previous movies br br the doubting priest sex and the priesthood politics and religion church hypocrisy conspiracy involving the church the dawn of a new evil age all kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil br br pretty stupid and lame with a weak storyline to suffice the story revolves around two concepts absolution better known as the sacrament of anointing the sick the last rights a person can ask for to cleanse one's sins while on the brink of death and excommunication the act of cutting a person off from the church basically an excommunicated person can't receive absolution thus comes in the sin eater and i'll leave it at that throw in all the dopy things i already listed and you have the order br br i found the sex scene with the priest interlaced with shots of a picture of the virgin mary rather insulting to catholics it also ends with heath ledger saying i paraphrase i am the redeemer and damner of sins i live on without love blah blah blah cue him walking in dark alley with long trench coat alla the matrix br br i gave this movie a 1 for not only being crappy and unoriginal but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process if you want to see something better i suggest the prophecy with christopher walken
<START> i've been watching a lot of cartoon or animated movies because i have a baby girl who likes to watch tv i began to watch this movie to see if i would like my little one to watch it and no at the beginning i thought it was such a cute movie like the bambi movie but all the way it was like insinuating the ducky was a homosexual the info said that they were making fun of him because he wasn't good at sports but that was not the case it just seems like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay being gay it was also very sad as far as the ducky's dad and all i don't know i guess if you're gay you'd like it but i don't think i'm going to watch it again with my little one
<START> it is quite a simple not very active but very charming film there were moments where i can see why cher won the academy award for best actress but there were other times when i wondered why glenn close didn't win for fatal attraction anyway oscar and golden globe winning and bafta nominated cher plays loretta castorini a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by mr johnny cammareri danny aiello to marry him he promises her he'll be back in a month as his mother is sick so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible only problem is when she finds johnny's one handless brother ronny golden globe nominated nicolas cage they start having a relationship and there love goes on to that moon scene where the title comes from also starring oscar nominated vincent gardenia as cosmo castorini oscar bafta and golden globe winning olympia dukakis as rose castorini and john mahoney as perry it ends with no wedding for johnny and loretta but she and ronny were happy together it won the oscar for best writing screenplay written directly for the screen and it was nominated for best director for norman jewison in the heat of the night and best picture it was nominated the baftas for best score for dick hyman and best original screenplay and it was nominated the golden globes for best motion picture comedy musical and best screenplay it was number 96 on 100 years 100 quotes snap out of it it was number 17 on 100 years 100 passions and it was number 41 on 100 years 100 laughs very good
<START> lynch the man has some really great stuff he knows how to disturb us then reward us by getting us think in different ways this however is altogether different dumbland's reward is 1 absurd comedy earned by enduring 99 stupidity i may have laughed once but somewhere around episode 4 i just started watching on fast forward didn't miss a thing i felt relieved when it ended and that's part of the point with this series it's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations rounded out with annoying animation voices and sound but recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make dumbland worthwhile
<START> i just have to throw my two cents in relax it's a comedy yes for the most part the characters are broadly written and acted i can't think of many comedies where they aren't this isn't a new release it's out on video and airs on cable almost every week would i see it in a theater sure i did when it first came out it's funny that should be enough br br even if i didn't like it at all i'd still watch it on cable for michael keaton he's an underrated and under appreciated actor i can't think of another who is so capable in every genre nor can i think of one who's as successful a comedic actor who's also an action star short lived but still who's also a romantic lead who's also a dramatic actor a villain and a hero i can't think of any at least not in hollywood certainly none who have been successful at all those genres i mean there's tom cruise but to me he's better at being tom cruise than becoming a character however this isn't about michael keaton vs tom cruise so i'll move on br br gung ho is worth renting heck it's worth buying since you can probably find it for 10 00 or less at stores like wal mart it's worth watching on cable if you have cable or satellite it's one of those fun to watch movies you can put your brain on pause and just relax and chuckle away br br to ask for more in my honest opinion is asking too much
<START> this movie is just so awful so bad that i can't bear to expend anything other than just a few words avoid this movie at all costs it is terrible br br none of the details of the crimes are re enacted correctly lots of slaughterhouse footage weird cuts and edits no continuity to the plot the acting is absolutely the most amateur i have ever seen br br this bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of it's content the camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky it looks as if it was shot on video br br in fact now that they've got dennis rader with life in prison i wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as well br br seriously don't even think about watching this one i'd give it a negative star if i could
<START> saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released had me snifflin' like a baby as i left the theatre trying not to let anyone see so when i saw it again now in '07 i knew what to expect the sobs were ready primed as their required moment approached thankfully this time i was at home br br what i hadn't remembered from my youthful viewing or perhaps hadn't noticed because of it was the technical brilliance of this movie the use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue the camera work which seemed to place the viewer together with the characters in the scene think of the opening when joe is crossing the street to the diner the camera pans behind the woman child sitting on a bench in the foreground framing the street scene br br the story itself the characters seedy sad brutally real it is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn then again joe ratso could be any of us must have been '70 when i saw it i recall that upon leaving the theatre i was impelled to find the company of friends all these years later i'm glad i'm not alone tonight this is one hell of a great movie
<START> i loathed this film the original phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery like many 70s horror flicks it looked and felt like some creepy unfinished documentary phantasm ii from the late 80s pumped up the action but maintained this nice attention to mood sadly phantasm iii is just awful it tediously explains all of the weird happenings in the previous films which diminishes rather than expands their power it shamelessly degrades imagery from the first phantasm like a cheap reenactment of the original there are so many flying spheres in this movie that they seem more like household pests than menacing death orbs hundreds hang from the ceiling like christmas balls swaying in the draft didn't anyone the prop master the dp the editor the director notice or care that they looked so crummy even worse phantasm iii presents one corny unfunny joke after another how different from the intensity of the first film the original phantasm used humor to relieve its relentless focus on death phantasm iii uses death to set up countless cheap jokes about reggie's horniness several refer to the film's flying balls ha ha oh i get it balls maybe the crew got a kick out of these jokes but they are on us
<START> while there aren't any talking animals big lavish song production numbers or villians with half white half black hair it does have 1 thing realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance and walt roy did in their eras with the studio if you thought think the castaways or the island at the top of the world weren't identical or you hold them to a higher authority than atlantis then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin' cartoon
<START> back in the day i remembered seeing dumb nintendo power comics that had the same artwork as this show and then word came up that this show was a coming to a television near me i was not estatic but curious i was curious about how bad this show was gonna suck my friends all said that this show had no real meanings and was too silly for straight people like me to enjoy i'm actually gay so i decided to watch the show with low expectations br br what a horrible experience first off i hate the new characters tiff and tuff are so dumb and i hate how so many fanboys drool over tiff it's sad i also hate how they made chef kalasaki or whatever his nonstraight name was a good guy who owned a restaurant bad move 4kids tv escargoon is nothing but a loser adviser to the king dedede who sucks big time in this show and i hate the face of that one company that keeps supplying dedede with those awful weapons to destroy kirby so stupid i hate this show br br i then began to hate kirby even more since it was obvious nintendo was just aching to get kirby some popularity kirby'll never beat mario in the fight for coolness and kirby will always be nothing but a tiny little cream puff of gayness nuf said
<START> opening night released in 1977 tries to be an ambitious production it succeeds only in the truly stunning performance of gena rowlands her character of theatre actress myrtle is not necessarily someone we would love in real life she is self absorbed often obnoxious and makes life miserable for those around her in other words not unlike some actresses myrtle is also a woman on the edge of collapse we are not quite sure if the demons she is fighting are real or imagined although we are let in on the secret early rowlands is obviously well directed with love by her gifted husband actor director john cassavettes who has a role in the film as well this film is not without flaws it is overly long and the last part of the film where myrtle goes on stage while very drunk seems almost cruel the improvising in some of the dialogue at least while on stage goes on way too long some of the supporting characters give good performances especially from ben gazarra playing myrtle's sleazy producer joan blondell's character is never fully developed and i never could figure out why she was in the film except to placate myrtle see this film for rowlands alone she is fascinating throughout and it is tough to take your eyes off her although you will want to at times
<START> part two picks up not where the last film left off as part of the quasi conventionality of steven soderbergh's epic 4 hour event che's two stories are told as classic rise and fall scenarios in part two che guevara leaving his post as a bureaucrat in cuba and after a failed attempt in the congo only in passing mentioned in the film goes down to bolivia to try and start up another through the jungle style revolution things don't go quite as well planned at all probably because of che's then notorious stature as a communist and revolutionary and in part because of america's involvement on the side of the bolivian government and of course that castro wasn't really around as a back up for che br br as it goes the second part of che is sadder but in some ways wiser than the first part which makes sense as guevara has to endure low morale from his men betrayals from those around him constant mistakes by grunts and nearby peasants and by ultimately the enclosing larger military force but what's sadder still is that guevara no matter what won't give in one may see this as an incredible strength or a fatal flaw maybe both but it's also clear how one starts to see che if not totally more fully rounded then as something of a more sympathetic character true he did kill and executed and felt justified all the way and yet it starts to work on the viewer in the sense of a primal level of pity the sequence where guevara's health worsens without medicine leading up to the shocking stabbing of a horse marks as one of the most memorable and satisfying of any film this year br br again soderbergh's command of narrative is strong if on occasion slightly sluggish understandable due to the big running time and one or two scenes just feel totally odd matt damon but these are minor liabilities going this time for the straight color camera approach this is almost like a pure militia style war picture told with a great deal of care for the men in the group as well as guevara as the lord over this group and how things dwindle down the final scene and as always del toro is at the top of his game in every scene every beat knowing this guy so well for better and for worse that he comes about as close to embodiment as possible overall the two parts of che make up an impressive package history as drama in compelling style good for an audience even if they don't know che or better if they don't think highly of him it's that special 8 5 10
<START> prior to seeing show people my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick and slapstick only i could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous pratfalls but this masterful film proved me wrong davies in my view was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to lucille ball i mention lucy primarily because davies' mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point that i wonder if davies wasn't one of ball's primary influences this is coming from a 21 year old who had never before seen silent comedy and i must say that no matter how much of the period specific references you actually get i didn't apparently you will not be bored by this movie you will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies this is not only my favorite silent comedy but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time
<START> though the sopranos is yet another gift from the megahit the godfather and sequels which dramatized and to a certain extent glamorized the mafia the sopranos takes another tack no suited up classy mobsters here with homes in lake tahoe and stakes in vegas casinos these guys are goombahs with a front of waste management who deal with things that fall off the back of trucks topless bars protection money in short what the neighborhood mobs were all about br br colorful characters dominate this series which doesn't hold back on the sex and graphic violence tony soprano james gandolfini is a mob head with a wife and two children living in new jersey who suffers from panic attacks as he tries to balance his biological family with his mafia one to get to the bottom of his attacks he sees a psychiatrist jennifer melfi lorraine bracco who is afraid of him and yet attracted to him at the same time tony's henchman paulie his nephew christopher his uncle junior the titular head of the mob his good friend pussy are all fully fleshed out characters br br as we learn going through the series there are enemies not only from without but from within and one of those enemies includes tony's sickly but horrible mother nancy marchand who convinces junior that tony is a danger to him tony's sister janice meanwhile is searching for money in her mother's house with a stethoscope and a geiger counter tony has mistress problems and a wife edie falco who puts up with a lot because she loves him all the while keeping ties to her catholic religion the church frowns on divorce she tells one woman contemplating a split let the pope live with him is the response as far as tony's mistress problems his psychiatrist points out that tony is attracted to demanding women for whom nothing is ever enough and asks him if it sounds familiar yeah it sounds like his mother br br i'm of italian descent and yes i'm sick of italians being shown in a negative light and everyone assuming all italians are mobsters yet you can't help liking this show which is a constant reminder of our culture thanksgiving it's pointed out isn't turkey and sweet potato pie it's the antipasto the manicotti the meatballs and escarole and then the bird not to mention the right on pronunciation of words like melenzana mullinyan escarole scarole manicotti manigot etc the only un italian thing about tony is that he doesn't have a finished basement something unheard of in the rest of my family except my parents never had one either br br the standouts in this show are gandolfini as a ruthless gangster on antidepressants falco who is brilliant as his wife and bracco as the tortured jennifer but everyone is excellent if you can take the violence and the language this is a great show an unrelenting portrait of new jersey mob life
<START> i love this film and it is such a wonderful example of a family jeopardy a romantic love story and a very sad story plot everything was just so perfect and excellent about this film it was such a great mixture of actors and actresses and with some laughs and a lot of cries this film deserves to get plenty of awards with the mention of beautiful scenario and although i would relate this film to the notebook and the family stone it was sort of much more cunning sad and brilliant than those films the evening tells of a love story between an old woman dreaming back to her younger years and her two daughters stay by her side while she is not well the story dating back is so strongly told and wonderful i was sitting on the edge of my seat you really get to know all the characters and by the end i was wanting to watch it all over again this is a amazingly sad and vividly acted and plotted movie that is really one of a kind and should be seen by all for how wonderful it really is all the performances are astonishing and the film captures your attention from the very beginning and never lets go i loved it and am so glad that i watched it for it was truly an astonishing film
<START> this raggedy ann and andy movie is so adorable we love watching ann and andy sing and dance along with the camel with the wrinkled knees this movie is what made the camel with the wrinkled knees so popular singing his song i'm nobodies i love you if you love raggedy ann and andy watch the movie and you will see why it's a movie the kids love and adults
<START> this really was a waste of time the movie has a weak plot the story is fragmented and ends very abruptly with many loopholes though the animation is top notch br br once the movie started i tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by telling myself that it might get interesting in the later stage but it was never unique this same plot has been played over and over again but what made it worse was that the major plot hole was the whole story on how to kill the baddies the writer could have done so much more with the entire concept but seemed that he or she did not have their heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started br br overall too much hype but not able to deliver
<START> not that many films have truly exploited the fear of going to the dentist that many people have those in the profession have some genuinely intimidating looking instruments give writers dennis paoli stuart gordon and charles finch for deriving maximum make you squirm in your seat shock value from their premise br br corbin bernsen in a nicely nuanced performance is alan feinstone dedicated dentist whose train jumps off the tracks early on an unbalanced obsessive compulsive he starts dwelling on thoughts of decay even imagining it where there isn't any and also equating decay with corruption of society in general having witnessed his unfaithful wife brooke linda hoffman getting it on with their pool boy he determines to punish her at the same time he's under pressure from a smarmy i r s agent earl boen best known as dr silberman from the terminator franchise to do a favor in exchange for the agent keeping his mouth shut about feinstone's financial affairs feinstone starts to perceive everybody around him as decayed in one way or another and he goes on a murder spree as police detective gibbs the always welcome ken foree picks up his trail br br director brian yuzna clearly has great fun with the script it allows for some genuinely nasty and remarkably entertaining gore scenes that do just as well as creating sympathy for the victims as thrilling the audience the script gives the feinstone character some fine lines of dialog and is overall quite sly and amusing with large doses of pitch black humor such as feinstone ordering a victim to get their tongue out of the way brooke and the i r s agent figure in particularly effective torture scenes the makeup effects are for the most part quite good and the film does a fine job of maintaining its forward momentum as feinstone with his relentless drive for perfection switches from respected professional to unhinged killer in record time br br foree always cool and fun to watch is rather wasted in a standard issue detective role but there's some enjoyment in watching boen play his slimeball part to the hilt hoffman and christa sauls provide very appealing eye candy and a pre fame mark ruffalo can be seen in a small supporting role but this is all very much bernsen's show as he sinks his teeth pardon me for using that expression into his plum leading part with total conviction br br the dentist ranks as one of the more original and interesting horror films to come out of the 1990's br br 8 10
