<START> one of the all time great science fiction works as visionary and thought provoking as blade runner or even gilliam's own brazil willis gives his best performance here but he's outdone by pitt's incredibly frenetic turn that's unlike anything he's done before or since even stowe isn't out of her league here though the story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about the climactic scene is beautifully magnificent and the last lines fit perfectly the scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way lots of dark humour on display here fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography in my top ten
<START> she is such an extraordinary singer who cares about anything else that final scene is one of the best moments in all of show biz bar none i'm glad she kept the camera on herself for ten minutes she deserves that iconic status such is the power of the voice br br i first saw this film when i was five and it had a huge impact on me i see it today and yes i can see some of the flaws like esther wanting to leave the grammy's right as her award is being announced br br but some of the other user comments are just plain false i mean where is the gratuitous nudity maybe we saw different films br br streisand's singing ability is monumental and if she has a big ego fine br br she's earned it
<START> oh where are you going my little one little one br br turn around and you're two turn around and you're four br br i remember these shows when they were first broadcast on disneyland i remember sitting there electrified by werner van braune's explanations of rocket science i watched as history science and humor were all interwoven in an engrossing story of possibilities br br that was fifty years ago and the shows are back in the disney treasures series and what a treasure they are i watched them last night and tonight with my 8 year old daughter who at first would not even come in the room but later changed her mind when she saw they were partly animated as she watched i watched her and by the end she was nearly as engrossed as i had been br br turn around and you're a young wife with babes of your own br br sure some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong but there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate and the overall presentation is still impressive i found myself thinking my daughter's teacher might want to show them to her class not only as a 50 year old artifact but also as fun and easy to understand lessons in history br br turn around turn around turn around and again you're wondering how much has really changed in 50 years
<START> pet semetary 1989 9 10 the creed family have just moved into the small town of ludlow the family consists of a father louis a mother rachel a brother gage and a daughter ellen they are greeted with kindness by jud crandall jud is 89 and could basically tell you about the entire history of ludlow br br behind the creed's new house there is a path leading to a pet cemetery spelled pet sematary when ellen wants to go up to see it jud willfully takes the family on a trip that is the start of hell for the creed family br br when rachel and the kids are gone ellen's cat church dies jud feels that ellen isn't ready for the death of her cat so he suggests louis follow him further up the path past the pet cemetery br br jud tells louis of this burial ground once used by micmac indians louis buries church without jud's help a couple of days later church returns alive but from hell br br this movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me aside from the exorcist the greatest performance would ever be zelda rachel's sister with spinal meningitis or victor pascow a ghost who tries to help the creeds from making the mistake of bringing back things from the dead br br the music in this movie plays an extravagant part it is at the same time sad and mysterious it goes along with the movie wonderfully br br 9 10
<START> simply awful slasher molded from the i know what you did last summer type of fodder has beautiful wealthy college students spending spring break in a florida condo being murdered one by one a misfire in every category imaginable from properly built suspense to the executed death sequences nothing is handled properly and the characters leave little more than caricatures you root to see decimated as quick as possible del tenney the curse of the living corpse i eat your skin of all people executive produced co wrote and stars as a priest in a pivotal role whose relationship to the killer i guess means something to why he's psychotic the revelation of the killer is awkwardly handled and ineffective probably not surprising a soul who watches it there are a lot of attempted jump scares with one character popping out to frighten their friend which couldn't even manufacture a few cheap thrills because they are so calculated in such a tepid way most of the attacks occur off screen with bleeding throat cuts or pools representing the only real display of violence the protracted finale where the killer goes on and on with the actor desperately trying to make his villain as diabolical and demented as possible is embarrassing and tense less there's not one single positive to derive from this clichÃ©d and dull exercise with the pretty cast making little effort to rise past their one dimensional roles and for pity sake they could've at least allowed us to see joey lawrence get decapitated or something for withstanding the misery of sitting through this junk heap for 90 agonizing minutes br br dorie barton as the heroine final girl beth morgan who the killer seems to be obsessed with couldn't be more vacuous and uninteresting oh she was in rehab and takes pills for her nightmares such intriguing exposition chad allen cast against type as a very intimidating friend of the group who happens to disappear from the film first setting up the idea that he's the first victim has a tough hill to climb with his role so steep he eventually stumbles rolling uncontrollably with no end in sight jeff conaway needing some cash i guess has the beleaguered fbi agent role whose daughter's murder motivates him to seek out the killer leading him to florida jack mcgee has his usual a hole role as a smart mouth florida police chief who is often nose to nose with conaway's agent br br oh the answer to the title's question not really because once you get the answer you will wonder why you bothered with this anyway
<START> my how the mighty have fallen kim basinger is a great actress but she was definitely slumming when she took this role this movie is bad for one reason in particular lapses in logic its looks like one of those movies that would have been passable with all its plot holes if it had came out in the 80s and 90s but in 2008 it just looks real stupid this is the worst thriller i've ever seen and i've seen the bone collector and twisted br br the story details della kim basinger is just getting from buying gifts in a mall an is harassed by a gang of thugs that end up killing a cop that came to her aid from then on she is chased by these idiotic goons through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools br br so many things are wrong with this movie as i said this movie leaps over logic at every turn and with the exception of kim basinger the acting is made for tv bad hell this pseudo thriller is made for tv bad the way she kills each of these politically correct thugs 1 caucasian 1 hispanic 1 asian and 1 african american all coming together to stalk a caucasian woman don't you just love america is laughable to a fault the way she killed the hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically the sex scene with the main hoodlum was so out in left field that it make you shake your head in shame i only recommend this to lovers of bad films and no one else anybody else especially kim basinger fans would do well not to own this flick you don't want see an actress you respect in a film this bad now do you of course not you were warned
<START> spoilers br br from the very moment i saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10 00 news i wanted to see it i don't remember who it was or which local omaha newscast carried the review but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church going nebraskan they showed a snippet from the scene where john glover is about to kidnap ann margret when she's swimming in the pool glover's character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out i was hooked there was one problem though i was only 13 years old at the time and i had to wait a year until it came out on cable let's just say it was worth the wait br br if ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine this movie is it to call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement the film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman roy scheider who is as effective as ever plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains john glover's character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time he's sleazy funny at times and always on the brink of doing something crazy then there's robert trebor's nice name by the way character leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme he is a whimpering sweating coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models then you have clarence williams iii as bobby shy a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason who could forget the wake up call he gives vanity with the giant teddy bear br br after dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he's up against scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation that is until glover goes after his wife the conflict is played out brutally with virtually the entire cast getting shot raped or blown up br br i don't know why i love this movie so much it really should creep me out but it doesn't maybe it's because these characters are all interesting and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try it's scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like glover's running around out in l a looking for trouble just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle hey sport have a nice day br br this film has plenty of shootouts cool cars great dialog like the line in my opening statement and decent acting plenty of cameos by real life porno stars look for ron jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at glover's place br br another thing i must add how hot are the women in this film wow travolta did right by marrying kelly preston yum we also see vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again christian and ann margret what else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential american beauty br br 9 of 10 stars br br so sayeth the hound br br added feb 14 2008 rip roy scheider
<START> a comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little british effort the divorce of lady x 1938 it marks the first pairing of laurence olivier and merle oberon before that little film about uncontrollable passion on the 19th century english moors and while olivier and oberon are not particularly well suited to screwball comedy it all flows along nicely oberon is leslie a young woman who ends up in priggish divorce lawyer logan's olivier hotel suite by way of a nasty english fog preventing travel she does everything possible to irritate him but in the crazy way films go he falls for her and she falls for him but a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when oberon's lady x that's all she leaves oliver in a note is thought by olivier to be a married woman to make matters worse and more amusing lord mere ralph richardson goes to olivier wanting a divorce from his wife whom dear larry thinks must be oberon there is some nice battle of the sexes dialogue and fun exploration of sexual politics you can see that olivier is not too confident with the comedy but in true olivier he's a consummate professional and delivers and he handles the screwball twists and turns maybe not with ease but with gusto oberon was no great shakes as an actress but she was usually competent enough and despite their reputed off screen dislike of her worked well with olivier this was filmed in early technicolour that looks very primitive today everyone looks even whiter than michael jackson but perhaps the print needs cleaning up
<START> this is one excellent sammo hung movie actually this is a great piece of hong kong action cinema the story tells the story of pedicab drivers in macao looking for love and getting mixed up w a vicious pimp the performances are excellent and the characters are all likable and well defined the story is involving and has enough romance drama comedy and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes sammo hung proves here that he's probably the best fight choreographer in the business the action is simply amazing esp the fight w lau kar leung and the finale billy chow and sammo hung are amazing a must see for any fan of action
<START> almost golden the jessica savitch story br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 br br sound format stereo br br bland soap opera dramatisation of the rise and fall of america's first female tv news anchor with a tighter script and direction and a better cast this might have passed muster but the flimsy story really wasn't worth the effort a good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go typically strong production values in the tv movie conveyor belt manner but it's all as superficial as old fluff and just as engaging
<START> oh it really really is i've seen films that i disliked more due to whatever reason but never have i seen a film that just fails in every single aspect of film making it even fails to fail at film making in a way the hercules in new york could be said to do it's not the film i like the least but it is the very worst film i've ever seen br br the acting is the first thing that strikes you i've never seen a worse acted film outside of pornography in fact i've plenty of pornographic films that are acted a damn site better than this it really is awful br br technically it's terrible the camera work is amateurish the editing is nonsensical i presume they couldn't afford proper sound equipment and this meant that every scene in a car and there's a lot of them has them driving at about three miles per hour and every scene set outside by the same patch of woods and there's a lot of them too is actually dubbed from a studio again lending more to the bad porn vibe br br the plot is nonsensical as many have pointed out i'll defend vampires walking in daylight by the fact that despite it being popularized by nosferatu this was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire mythos br br speaking of vampire mythos the writer had evidently read carmilla or at very least seen the vampire lovers i'm not sure how i feel about this swaying from impressed that a movie this dire has at least some aspirations to a gothic novel i'm very fond of or annoyed by its at best sledgehammer references and at worst total desecration of source material at very least 'the general' is an insult to peter cushing though br br it gets two stars however merely because i can't bring myself to vote one star for a film that has or at least purports to have both vampires and zombies in it incidentally i watched lifeforce another film that tenuously has vampires and zombies in it on the same day as this and despite being a rather flawed film itself really comes out a masterpiece compared to this br br so in the end this is not a film so bad it's good or so bad it's in any way enjoyable even drunk it's just a mess and worth no one's time watching
<START> 'umi wa miteita' 'the sea is watching' was akira kurasawa's swansong to film his adaptation of his favored novelist shugoro yamamoto's story into a screenplay he intended to film was his final mark he left on a brilliant career director kei kumai pays homage to both kurosawa and yamamoto in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to image br br set in 19th century japan the story explores the lives of the women of a geisha house whose sole purpose in life is to earn money by pleasuring men the house is run by an older couple who are genteel and the geishas are an enchanting group of women who know their trade and take pride in their careers each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha oshin nagiko tono supports her family who live in a neighboring village kikuno misa shimizu has customers both good and evil whom she manages to sustain with her stories of her higher caste oshin befriends an endangered samurai falls in love with the gentle fellow only to find that he must not marry out of his caste and leaves his pleasures with oshin to marry his promised betrothed oshin's heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physically monetarily by kikuno and the other geishas br br a handsome samurai ryosuke masatoshi nagase enters oshin's life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her kikuno is beset by problems deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her and coping with a rich but abusive customer all the while the sea is watching and as a typhoon destroys the geisha house and street oshin and kikuno sit atop the roof waiting for the promised rescue by ryosuke the manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice love and devotion the sea is watching and will find protection for true love br br the photography by kazuo okuhara is breathtakingly beautiful night scenes with glowing lanterns and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and turbulent the acting is a bit strained for edo art but the characters are well created and keep the story credible the one distraction which is definitely not something kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track but in the end there is enough of kurosawa's influence to imbue this film with his brand of dreamlike wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema grady harp
<START> i am curious yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile it doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level as for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic nc 17 that isn't true i've seen r rated films with male nudity granted they only offer some fleeting views but where are the r rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia nowhere because they don't exist the same goes for those crappy cable shows schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight and those pretentious indie movies like the brown bunny in which we're treated to the site of vincent gallo's throbbing johnson but not a trace of pink visible on chloe sevigny before crying or implying double standard in matters of nudity the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude and the same cannot be said for a man in fact you generally won't see female genitals in an american film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica this alleged double standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies
<START> i thought that zombie flesh eaters 2 was quite a good horror film when a terrorist's body infected with a stolen chemical is recovered by the us military the corpse is then cremated releasing the virus into the atmosphere over a small island soon the infected locals turn into flesh hungry zombies and a group of soldiers on leave must team up with a group of tourists and board themselves up in a abandoned hotel as they try to fight off the aggressive living dead i did not find this film to be as good as the original film zombie flesh eaters but it was still an ok horror film with some good action i did not think that it was one of the best in the series 4 10
<START> this is a lot of silliness about a woman from london who marries a tea planter from ceylon whom she barely knows it's full of cliches and the liz taylor character is not believable it has a marvelous set some exotic location footage it shows taylor at the height of her beauty she looks stunning
<START> i have read the other comment about this movie and usually i try not to be harsh in my criticisms because i try to be a nice person however this movie is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen and thats topping a lot of bad usa network plus cinemax nights whoever thought of this movie needs to be prevented from ever making another one this film disgusted me in a way that no other film ever i really think these people are insane just save your time and do not watch this fllm please i wish that i had the acting is horrible the plot what plot is stupid and degrading and insane i really do not think this should have been made into a movie but that is my opinion and i am trying to save you from wasting your time
<START> if you want to watch something that is for 'him' and 'her' so to say then this is the film to pick i am a sucker for rom coms but my husband is not always so keen what a guy anyway i managed to get him to watch it because i told him it was about sport and you know what he loved it br br drew barrymore is very funny and her leading man sorry but can't remember his name is equally as good when i watched the film it was called 'the perfect match' but i think the title was changed for the uk as it is based on the book fever pitch and there was already a film made about football with that title the same film but the uk version phew br br anyway all of the reviews on here will tell you more details if you need them buy girls take it from me get your hubby boyfriend in front of the television on a saturday night and you will both laugh and cry together a real gem
<START> if the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless one might well refer to ned kelly as an australian western for the people down under ned kelly was apparently a folk hero bandit akin to robin hood jesse james bonnie and clyde and butch cassidy and the sundance kid the descendant of irish immigrants kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an australian law officer a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison to get back at the government for this mistreatment kelly his brother dan and two other companions became notorious bank robbers winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country br br perhaps because we've encountered this gentleman bandit scenario so many times in the past ned kelly feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's stereotypes and clichÃ©s on its way to the inevitable showdown ned is the typical heart of gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and even then only with the deepest regret he also has the pulse of the common folk as when in the middle of a bank robbery he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it what movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that it's acts of selective generosity like this of course that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers that be and the status quo geoffrey rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment there's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers so turned on is she by the romantic derring do of the criminal lifestyle and the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another br br heath ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging it doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film br br ned kelly might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in australian history but as an entertainment it's just the same old story told with different accents
<START> what a poor image of professional police officers is displayed on the television in the watching of this alleged reality show one can only hope that the actual reasonable suspicion that leads to probable cause that leads to the totality of the circumstances involved to make a stop then the pat down of the outside of one's garment then to be able to articulate why the officer went into someone's pocket and retrieved contraband was cut out of the scenes because if it wasn't the arrest in most places are going to be tossed should they even get passed a supervisor a report of a warrant over the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant unless the person dispatching has the original warrant in hand if the dispatcher is reading from a computer printout it is good enough for an arrest but it does not necessarily mean the warrant is still in effect since i haven't seen a dis claimer from cbs i may have missed it cbs could be in trouble
<START> ok i will sum up this movie a bunch of skanky british women have some disease that basically is turning them into zombies the whole movie consists of these women talking smoking and rarely going out for meat or humans to eat i swear i had to make myself watch this movie ugh
