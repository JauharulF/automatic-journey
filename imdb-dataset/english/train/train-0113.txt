<START> this is the most compelling and excellent performance that robert taylor ever gave it even surpasses his wonderful performance as johnny eager coming a full 14 years after that film his looks are still a wonder to see but he has a maturity now that gives him the edge in this gritty violent role charlie gilson taylor is the last of his breed a buffalo hunter who kills not for the money but for the pleasure his wild eyed killing of not only buffalo but human beings is stunning to watch he is basically a lonely man needing the people around him but they dislike him because of his sociopath behavior his partner is sandy mckenzie stewart granger who is sick of the hunt and only goes along because he is a failure at anything else along the way charlie kills a family of indians and captures the beautiful debra pagent charlie tries to seduce her to no avail but sees that sandy is interested in her also granger is kind of sad to watch so fed up with the hunt longing to go away with the girl and her baby lloyd nolan as the drunken skinner is wonderful with his wise cracks and accordian playing russ tamblyn plays the half breed trying to fit in a white world the group is an odd mix of good and evil young and old in the end taylor gets spooked by the buffalo as many hunters before him had and runs off leaving sandy with the girl upon his return that night sandy leaves with the woman setting charlie off on a rampage of killing in a quest to get sandy and have the girl for himself the final confrontation comes in a snow storm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it it is taylor's film all the way and he was truly a much underrated actor of the era
<START> i had my doubts about another love story wherein disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication and it's still not at the top of my list but the performances from helena bonham carter and kenneth branagh and exemplary almost stunning and rescue this from being just another tear jerker carter's depiction of an als victim is strong perhaps even overdone at times sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings but the overall effect is commendable and rewarding branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performance br br
<START> i have to admit i wasn't expecting much going into this film viewing in my japenese film class but this film really blew me away the director does a wonderful job following through with the title of his film truly portraying a picture of madness i think the fact that this film is silent adds to the resemblance of madness helping the viewer experience the characters inner world rather than the world outside his mind this film just added to my feelings about foreign silent films vs american in that the foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than going for the fluffy film always with the happy ending exercising the imagination very little
<START> saw this a couple times on the sundance channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system a semi surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture or the lack of it focusing on some seriously wacked way beyond the hollywood fringe dwellers it had an amusing early performance from mark ruffalo and some memorable cinematography from the dp who did the polish brothers movies there was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart this film had cult classic written all over it and i'm surprised it's not yet out on dvd br br hopefully soon
<START> this is an incredible film i can't remember the last time i saw a swedish movie this layered it's funny it's tragic it's compelling and most of all it's a slice of swedish small town life it crushes the clichÃ©s and dwells deeper it makes you feel connected not only to the main characters but to all the characters br br big city girl tracing back to her roots her small hometown to celebrate her father's 70th birthday crossing paths with people she hasn't met in several years although the story itself isn't unique it offers a fresh approach the center of the story is the relationship between three sisters on different stages in life who aren't very close or at least don't realize how close they are br br one key reason that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this film is the immaculate cast first i'm more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no so called 'a list' swedish actors in this film usually there is a handful of actors that has the ability to find their way into almost every major production in sweden this time the production company managed to keep it real by casting actors who actually seem to love their profession sofia helin is probably the first swedish actress since eva rÃ¶se to prove that you don't need words to convey an emotion br br the writing is also very appealing the dialogue is more than believable and compared with other swedish films from the past year or two it's ahead by miles maria blom controls everything from the beginning and if you didn't know you would never guess that this is her first time writing and directing a feature length film i can't wait for her next one br br once you start watching this you really want to see it through
<START> everything about this film was terrible to start with this film had a pretty good cast and i find it impossible to make such a great cast into the biggest disaster to the gangster film genre ever the sound track was like one of a very bad slap stick comedy it had this music through the whole film and it started to get quite irritating br br please please please please please do not inflict yourself with this disaster you will only be hurt
<START> black guy becomes rich white guy and rich white guy seems to embrace hip hop culture and most of the funny moments of this film play off of this the problem i have is that it doesn't work and almost never works br br ok so no one would expect lance to grab a body like that and suddenly start acting like charles wellington that would be too much to ask i'll grant that but at the same time it goes too far the other direction i'm supposed to imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely upending things playing like he's a bastion of hip hop culture and people just accept him and what about sontee who falls in love with him as a rich white guy even though she doesn't care about his money or power this is so completely unbelievable it's not even funny br br i just couldn't suspend disbelief and i couldn't finish the movie i added one extra star because it did make me laugh even hard a couple of times but i just couldn't get get past the whole white guy doing hip hop thing that has never been well done in any movie i've ever seen that tries it this was no exception
<START> special effects good br br script terrible no plot no depth no meaning this film rendered superman as a meaningless hero a hero with no archetype in the original film he represented america in the cold war here he represented nothing but a hulk br br sure the actors were fine kevin spacey was a fine choice among others br br this still does not resolve the problem that this film had no depth whatsoever i cannot see how anyone can come away with anything meaningful from this film when superman was and is daily created to be a meaningful hero in not only comics but also in people's minds this was a real waste of money considering how many directions this film could have taken br br just a few instances lex luthor could have been a villain of global corporatism political domination totalitarianism and on and on and on he was just another goofball hackman incarnation br br and superman for what did he stand in this film nothing but another hack savior figure br br wait until it comes to the dollar theater if you see it at all
<START> made by french brothers jules and giddeon naudet and narrated by robert de niro and firefighter james hanlon this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how new york's finest shone on it's darkest day i first saw this when i was a young naive 12 year old and at that age it still touched me knowing how serious 9 11 really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of 9 11 we were finding out who the heroes were how there everyday lives were composed and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their selves these brave men put their lives on the line and watching this just increases my admiration for them watch if you can this is the best documentary i have personally ever seen
<START> roeg has done some great movies but this a turkey it has a feel of a play written by an untalented high school student for his class assignment the set decoration is appealing in a somewhat surrealistic way but the actual story is insufferable hokum
<START> the name of this film alone made me want to see just what it was all about so i taped this film during the early hours of the am if you ever wanted to see what miners had to go through during the early days and actually see a dramatic scene when the mine crumbles in on the men this film clearly wants to show that germany and france can work together and be friends after ww i and how the germans came to the aid of the french miners much to the unbelief of the french townsfolk the actors were all outstanding with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small young boy who worked in the mine there is an old old retired miner who manges to go down the mine by ladder when the elevator breaks down if you are a real film buff this is a film you will not want to miss
<START> 'stanley and iris' show the triumph of the human spirit for stanley it's the struggle to become literate and realize his potential for iris it's to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow the beauty of the movie is the dance that robert deniro and jane fonda do together starting and stopping before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on in that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is thus being credible unlike some other reviewers i found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture the supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances all in all an excellent movie the best thing i take from it is hope
<START> spoiler do not read this if you think about watching that movie although it would be a waste of time by the way the plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if you read this or not anyway br br if you are wondering whether to see coyote ugly or not don't it's not worth either the money for the ticket or the vhs dvd a typical chick feel good flick one could say the plot itself is as shallow as it can be a ridiculous and uncritical version of the american dream the young good looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in new york the few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail such as the tragic accident of the father the difficulties of violet's relationship with her boyfriend and so on mcnally director tries to arouse the audience's pity and sadness put does not have any chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting especially piper perabo completely fails in convincing one of jersey's fear of singing in front of an audience the only good and quite funny thing about coyote ugly is john goodman who represents the small ray of hope of this movie br br i was very astonished that jerry bruckheimer produced this movie first gone in 60 seconds and now this what happened to great movies like the rock and con air that was true bruckheimer stuff br br if you are looking for a superficial movie with good looking women just to have a relaxed evening you should better go and see charlie's angels it's much more funny entertaining and self ironic instead of this flick br br two thumbs down 3 out of 10
<START> regarded by many critics as one of the biggest stinkers of all time certainly the biggest stinker of director brian de palma's career br br sherman mccoy tom hanks is a smug rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover maria ruskin melanie griffith are involved in a hit and run his story is chronicled by another smug guy reporter peter fallow bruce willis br br well as i said in my summary br br what is this movie supposed to be it seems to combine comedy drama and satire but it sure doesn't add up to much it's undermined by unimaginably loathsome one dimensional characters who you'd never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life br br i'm no big fan of the novel i started reading it once but couldn't finish it because it wasn't to my liking but it's obvious to me that those who did do enjoy the novel consider this film to be a complete travesty br br i've never seen so many talented actors strive to hard to give a below average movie some semblance of quality and fail what a waste br br the problems start with casting nice guy tom hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be unsympathetic and the role of peter fallow in the novel was that of a brit bruce willis is badly badly miscast in the role what was the thinking there br br alas not even morgan freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact being obliged to deliver a lame heavy handed lecture on 'decency' after the climax br br this movie ends up turning into an absurd farce br br i liked the assemblage of talent for that i will give it four out of ten but i'm sure some people will say a much better movie could have been made from the source material
<START> just a stilted rip off of the infinitely better murder she wrote it is absolutely amazing that this poorly written garbage lasted for a full eight years i'm sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do or simply remembered its star from the old dick van dyke show van dyke who only had a decent career in the 1960s never was much of an actor at all by his own admission and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993 he looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking his talentless real life son barry a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didn't involve his father plays his son in the series
<START> simply put this is the worst movie since police academy mission to moscow if you liked that movie you will probably like this one br br what were they thinking some ideas should stay just that an idea the fact that this idea could itself to film should be a criminal offense br br what was so bad about it i hear you ask one word everything br br cost to hire 4 50 cost in time to watch 89 minutes br br i want a refund on both
<START> there are few comedies like this where almost every line and every character come close to flawless this is soooo funny and it has quite a bit of satire there to sally field is heading the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good if not perfect job with her daytime tv diva sometimes her acting is just a little to broad and over the top but 90 of the time she is a riot in the same league is kevin kline robert downey jr and whoopy goldberg who unfortunately has too little to do here downey jr may not convince entirely as a comedian and has not the timing right all the time but he struggles with his part which is to be honest the most ungrateful one but the shining star here is cathy moriarty as celeste a true bitch if there ever was one with more than one nasty secret you will see in the absolutely stunning finale sadly elisabeth shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part i normally like ms shue but here she acts as a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie but it is not something damaging and for the most part she is at least adequate otherwise brimming with memorable lines and situations this is a comedy to watch whenever it is on tv or wherever
<START> i loved kolchak the night stalker since i saw it on the night it premiered on september 13 1974 i loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by gil melle hey where's the soundtrack guys and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level when darren mcgavin's carl kolchak starts to discover odd situations he reacts like most people would he finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger he is frightened even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode it's rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force he's usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works sometimes he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are in one episode he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly he must go back and defend himself he's heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn't do but that doesn't mean he probably wouldn't much rather someone else did it instead of him he's a regular guy doing a job trying to make a buck not a monster hunter he just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural which he has an interest in but he doesn't want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do if his plan to defeat the creature didn't work you will often see him running for his life to get away from it which is of course what i would do in the situation that's why i was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him you were scared for him and for the other characters too the producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it's all for naught if you don't care about the characters darren mcgavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a monster of the week show and he decided not to continue i can tell you i mourned when this show was canceled when i was a kid but as an adult i can see why it couldn't go on in that formula for very long i still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred mcgavin as the bumbling determined and brusk but good hearted reporter for the ins known as carl kolchak i seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why i loved the show it's not the monsters darkly lit sets creepy music or goofy guest stars although they are all vital ingredients the secret to it's success is right there in the title kolchak the night stalker without mcgavin's lovable bumbling carl kolchak to root for and to care for then it just ain't a night stalker
<START> this show is not clever that's basically what it boils down to the original humor that these writers try to pull off to avoid completely biting off the rest of the worlds bush bashing is just unfunny in another comment someone quotes a couple hilarious lines the standout for me was george h w bush telling the kids they're not supposed to watch any tv besides fox news wow i thought the episodes i saw were bad the fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic br br my problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these folks are getting a second season i'm a liberal republican and i know bush hasn't been a good president we all do but that's no excuse for putting out this utterly poopie waste of time i place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind 'meet the spartans' their formula bite off as many already unfunny topical jokes as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit br br again just plain bad unfunny and it just makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is renewed but amazing and original shows like arrested development are canned after 3 solid seasons please don't watch this crap unless you're one of those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words bush and dumb is comedic gold br br oh and the voice of bush sucks all he does is slightly emulate a texan accent and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences at least south park admits the voices aren't accurate if you want funny political satire watch daily show colbert or look for any political sketches on robot chicken which is fun to watch since the stop motion action figure animation is extremely well done look for the george bush as a jedi bit on youtube priceless
<START> a very cheesy and dull road movie with the intention to be hip and modern shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles resulting only in sleepiness br br the cast is wasted the writing is stupid and pretentious the only thing worthwhile is the top notch lalo schifrin's soundtrack really cool and also the opening sequence very original and interesting br br run if you can the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved it is really pure garbage of course that this has its charm of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do
