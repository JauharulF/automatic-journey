<START> surprisingly well made little movie short in length at about 90 minutes for a low budget movie very well made plot is slow to unravel cast is excellent especially elizabeth van meter as the girlfriend with tourette's syndrome
<START> this is a weird movie about an archaeologist studying the culture of the ancient hohokam indians she takes a really fake looking mummy out of a burial cave and brings it home to study it well pretty soon she starts acting weird and talking to this mummy and shortly thereafter her son becomes possessed by the spirit of the mummy even stranger events take place as the spirit then tries to destroy the woman's family this is actually really boring overall and it will make you fall asleep the first couple of times you try to watch it but if you keep at it you may just make it to the end br br ahah what is the secret of the mummy is the mummy's spirit angry that it has been removed from the cave you may not be able to ascertain what the spirit's motivation is but if you like spooky shenanigans on a low budget and 70's hairstyles this will have a certain comforting appeal br br the way i have described the story is much clearer than the jumbled boring way the film lays the story out can a boring movie really be fascinating well somehow this one achieves that maybe this is a good movie at heart but executed in a rather awkward way i don't know what i do know is that i enjoyed it quite a bit despite its dullness br br fans of spider baby will be interested to know that a couple of music cues from that film are used in this one including an instrumental version of the theme song br br featuring one frightening and fairly well done sequence showing possessed boulders and rocks rolling around by themselves and eventually attacking some people in a camper other scenes in the movie are merely spooky or quirky but this one scene is actually pretty scary br br see this it's weird and it's worth your time you might even want one on your shelf
<START> in 1954 marlon brando was the hot actor after his performances in streetcar named desire and on the waterfront frank sinatra had yet to re invent himself on the silver screen but sinatra's portrayal as the erstwhile nathan detroit helped re establish sinatra with his fans br br it is a great screen version of a great play and the choices of leads and support players are terrific imagine a movie where brando sings this was his one and only singing role as he portrayed sky masterson in addition the female leads jean simmons and vivian blaine replaying her stage role as nathan's long suffering girlfriend adelade put in superlative efforts special mention goes to the great stubby kaye as nicely nicely and with all due respect to eric clapton no one's version of rockin' the boat even comes close to stubby's sheldon leonard who would go on to fame as tv producer of such shows as the danny thomas show and the dick van dyke show does harry the horse wonders b s pulley is excellent as the harsh mannered and rough talking big julie and even regis toomey offers his excellence as brother arvide br br it is one of the fun musicals to see good comedy and you get sinatra and brando soooooo luck be a lady tonight and brother it's your dice
<START> what kind of a documentary about a musician fails to include a single track by the artist himself unlike ray or countless other films about music artists half the fun in the theater or on the couch is reliving the great songs themselves here all the tracks are covers put on by uninteresting characters and these renditions fail to capture cohen's slow jazzy style more often the covers are badly sung folk versions yuck br br the interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures rather than with cohen himself only rarely does the film feature cohen reading his own work never singing like letters poems etc the movie really didn't capture much about the artist's life story either or about his development through the years a huge disappointment for a big cohen fan
<START> it is unbelievable that a script as clichÃ© and completely absurd could make any screen even the small one the dialogue in this movie makes catwoman seem like a high culture classic billy zane plays the bad ass harmonica playing elvis impersonating gunslinging martial arts master who gambles on the life of a down an out former football player turned gambling addict played by the winner of nbc's craptastic show next action star his performance is as cold as ice and not in a cool way the film takes place in vegas and since people play poker there the writers felt it was a perfect setting for a movie about a guy trying to survive 24 hours against an omnipresent wealthy gambler who has offered his target 2 4 million if he can make it through the day and so the hunt ensues a hunt reeking with unimpressive explosions construction yard settings shoddy cinematography and one liners containing the word bet or gamble the female winner is also tossed in the mix but for what reason i have no idea oh but don't worry nas fans the losers make their memorable cameos as well the surprise ending will knock your socks off if you love predictability or plagiarism joel silver should reevaluate his decision to sell out even more i wish he could give me those two hours of my life back
<START> the question when one sees a movie this bad is not necessarily how did a movie this bad get made or even why did i see this awful in the first place but what have i learned from this experience here's what i learned br br just because the rules of horror movies have been catalogued and satirized countless times in the last ten years doesn't mean someone won't go ahead and make a movie that uses all of them without a shred of humor or irony br br if your movie has to be described as loosely based on the video game you have script problems br br the black character may not always die first but the asian character does always know kung fu br br while you may be proud that you figured out how to do the the matrix effect on a budget that doesn't necessarily mean you should use it over and over again ad nausea br br being ron howard's brother does not guarantee choice roles br br whenever a scene doesn't edit together just use some footage from the video game no one will notice br br if your cousin's rap metal band offers to write your movie's theme for free politely decline br br zombie movies are not about people killing zombies they're about zombies killing people preferably in the most gruesome way possible that's what makes them scary br br white people who can pay 1600 to get to a rave deserve to die br br if you find an old book it will tell you everything you need to know anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks what was that or where are we br br bare breasts are not horror movie panacea br br a helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with sega magically transforms your movie from student film to major studio release try it br br just because you can name drop all three living dead movies that does not make you george romero or even paul w s anderson br br i've seen worse movies but only because i've seen mortal kombat annihilation
<START> i watched this film version of r d blackmore's classic novel as a substitute until the 2001 a e version was released on video and what a poor substitution it proved to be br br this version does not have the authentic i feel like i'm there aspect of the a e movie the actors are for the most part wooden with sean bean the exception and the romance seems forced and contrived in fact there is no kissing until the end of the movie the triangle between john ridd lorna doone or lady lorna dugal whichever you prefer and the evil carver doone isn't mentioned or expanded upon we don't get much insight into carver here or as to why he has some if any romantic feelings for lorna this movie cuts out many of the key and interesting characters of the novel such as counsellor doone and john's sharp tongued youngest sister lizzie which were crucial to the plot the screenplay itself is lacking in conviction the political intrigue also doesn't figure in the script the way lorna came into being with the doones isn't true to the original story now don't get me wrong clive owen is a handsome and talented actor watch gosford park and king arthur for confirmation but he comes across as bland and stoic throughout and long hair it may have been a bad wig just doesn't suit him polly walker is a lovely and accomplished actress see enchanted april and patriot games in which she also costarred with sean bean but she appears colorless and lackluster she has a cold sore on her lip that make up can't hide and the costumes don't seem authentic the late robert stephens does a respectable turn as sir ensor doone although he only refers to lorna as his favorite rather than his granddaughter which she was reputed to be in the book also it seems to me that owen and walker are too old for their roles maybe it's the make up and the scenery is brown cold gray and barren without so much of a hint of a sunny sky i understand that it is set in southwest england but it is green there and they do get their sunshine the portrayal of tom faggus' character and his death which doesn't happen in the novel depresses the film even more the one positive note is sean bean's performance as carver although it doesn't even come close to matching aidan gillen's portrayal in the a e movie bean does make one mean villain in short watch this only if you've got a few hours to kill but don't expect anything exciting or for it to be true to the novel see any other version but i highly recommend a e's film over this tired adaptation
<START> i don't think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it's over if you were ever scared this doesn't really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film doesn't tack on one of those happy endings story is about an american couple who travel to kyoto japan so that ted fletcher edward albert can write a book and he brings along his wife laura susan george and their daughter amy amy barrett their friend alex curtis doug mcclure who works at the american consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted about 140 years earlier in the same house a samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the fletcher's arrive it doesn't take long before strange things start happening br br spoiler alert br br at times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the fletcher's and they start to act like the japanese people that they were before and laura starts to flirt with alex which leads to an affair meanwhile ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of amy he goes to ask a monk for help unfortunately the ghosts get ted laura and alex to play out their death scene like it happened 140 years earlier br br this film was directed by kevin connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with mcclure on some of them while this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that i liked first it doesn't have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons instead it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts secondly it has susan george in the cast i've always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she doesn't have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it's one of the reasons why she was so popular but after appearing in silly films such as this i think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically this isn't a bad film but it's never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two the bottom line is that this is silly and i hope george decides to resume her career
<START> i think this is almost all i need to say i feel obliged to explain my actions though i've basically never seen such an armateur production and i mean that in all senses of the word although the physical camera work boom mic operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable unfortunately its not the only areas br br unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot this unfortunately has an awful script awful acting and worst of all awful annoying characters br br it's a crime that for the every independent film that gets distribution like haiku tunnel there's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths i don't know who the kornbluth brothers know at sony but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution i'm quite bemused as to why they picked this up br br the only part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title however the reason for that is even a let down i hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it i've seen a lot of films in my time and i'm very forgiving when in the cinema but this was too much i'll never forget 'tunnel' for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema shame it's such a low point br br
<START> if the australian post office ever needed a promotional film for recruitment then this is it this is one of those movies who's heart is in the right place and you can watch again and again miranda's performance is touching as it shows an aspect of australia unimagined by many europeans in that it can be cold wet and bleak just like anywhere else and just like anywhere else what is important is the people that surrounds you the characters in the movie are warm and welcoming and make the prospect of a career move into a 'dead letter office' a thought to be considered miranda has gone on to do bigger movies but i hope she always keeps a thought inside for this one
<START> three horror stories based on members of a transgressive hindu cult that return home but changed in some way in the first story our former cult member is now in an insane asylum and is visited by a reported who wants to find out about what went on at the cult somewhat slow going as story is told in flashbacks while the two sit on chairs and face each other reporter is particularly interested in what lead to the death of the participants what seemed rather boring suddenly turns very exciting with a surprising twist in the story things get quite bloody br br second story has a violent young criminal visiting a psychiatrist for mandatory therapy the patient seems to have some type of agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the task again things slow down a bit and get weird then there's a strange twist in the story that is very well written and surprising br br final story deals with spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove the persons illness from them with his hands one of the patients is a former cult member so the successful healing gets more complicated again we are surprised by a twist has a pretty gory scene in there br br there some nice female full frontal nudity as well as male full frontal nudity for some reason i found the stories to be very well written and the director succeeds entirely in setting up each story with its surprising twist and the gory aftermath br br note review of the german dvd
<START> there are some stallone movies i like but this movie didn't meet my low expectations i found this movie hard to believe for example a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the wilderness are prepared to survive for at least two days also in all this wilderness stallone and company keep running across bridges and ladders that provide convenient short cuts or plot devices also the treasury cops don't seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people also bad guys who couldn't hit the side of a barn with really high tech looking automatic weapons br br i liked john lithgow's villain initially but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn't care at all about any of his own bad guys or all of them getting killed eventually i just couldn't believe the character anymore br br not worth the price of a rental not even worth taking the time to watch
<START> sarafina was a fun movie and some of the songs were really great sarafina was very entertaining i don't normally like music things like this but the singing was not lame like it looked like on the box the movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the soweto rioting of 1976 it showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government who you can not sympathise with the singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent the clothing of the students in sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from soweto they made the movie actually in soweto which is why it looks very accurate in many parts all these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about aparthied as viewers we must be critical of the way the history of apartheid was presented as i said before you become sympathetic to the students this makes it potentially less reliable and objective also it changes some of the details from other accounts in sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students the police and army were very aggressive at soweto but this is probably an exaggerated event the police and army did shoot students but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this the fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime this is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students the movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about aparthied the teacher was arrested for being against the government and the mum goes to work in a white persons house but there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it or any details about the racist policies and laws by george s chris and finlay
<START> the movie was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a rip off of joeseph conrad's heart of darkness the river is replaced by a road and the boat becomes a jeep and walter kurtz is osama br br the claims made on the outside of the dvd box was overt fraud to br br take this fabricated death of a journalist and present it as factual br br while some portions have muslims supporting the 9 11 attacks for the usa's treatment of muslims around the world br br i alerted the video store that the movie should be removed from their documentary section and be placed in the war drama area for quasi fictional accounts of actual events
<START> i have been familiar with the fantastic book of 'goodnight mister tom' for absolutely ages and it was only recently when i got the chance to watch this adaption of it i have heard lots of positive remarks about this so i had high hopes once this film had finished i was horrified br br this film is not a good film at all 'goodnight mister tom' was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4 5 10 of the book was missed out particularly i found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this there was not much dialogue it was rushed and far too fast moving but i was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between william beech and tom in this film which was a true let down the casting was not all that good either i thought this could have been really good but it was so different to the book anextremely poor adaption one of the worst i've seen this deserves a decent remake that'd better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage
<START> dick tracy is one of my all time favorite films i must admit to those that haven't seen it you will either really love it or really hate it it came out a year after the success of batman so everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple but its based on a comic strip what did you expect creatively this movie is amazing the sets make up music costumes and the impressive acting make this film fantastic the film has bloodless violence and no bad language that's something rare these days directed produced and stars warren beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against al pacino's evil big boy caprice and his mob of thugs madonna steals the show as the seductive breathless mahoney this is one of the best characters madonna has ever played she has the best one liners i've heard madonna fans would love it one of the coolest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip this film is truly a piece of artwork that is sadly overlooked by the public to sum things up this film brings out the child in all of us it's a film that will leave you smiling at the end
<START> what a complete piece of trash plot notwithstanding when a movie's action revolves around airplanes you'd think the writers producers director or anyone would do a little bit of homework as to at least a few of the details the mistakes were so glaring that i was fuming by the end of the movie here are just a few i'm glad i missed the sr 71 sequence certain to have been worse than the air force one f 117 spectacle commercial airlines usually have their logos painted on the aircraft rather than boeing 747 Â likely the cheap use of some boeing advertising publicity footage by the director exposed wiring connected by wire nuts is mediocre at best for house wiring much less multi million dollar aircraft avionics wiring airplanes like the 747 rely on pressure alone rather than ship's supply oxygen to maintain breathable air and if they did rely on an on board supply the canister would be far bigger than fist sized medical tape is not a suitable substitute for a threaded hose connection those were f 16s not f 15s mach 1 speed of sound would be difficult to attain on a static engine run up for takeoff watch the airspeed indicator standard formation is simply keeping the formation inside one nautical mile route formation is what they were flying not the most useful formation for an intercept acquiring missile lock is not likely to get an airline pilot's attention they have no radar detection or countermeasures wait for my signal is not inter flight communication for preparing to fire anything depressurization from a door opening in flight is not grounds for an immediate steep left bank yelling into a headset does not make it transmit magnetic headings are given as headings not bearings and headings are between 001 and 360 degrees compasses in the air are just like compasses on the ground so turning left not port Â that's a boat thing from a bearing of 618 to 502 is just stupid it is in most cases impossible to just turn the yoke left until the correct heading is reached Â that sort of thing will result in 360 degree rolls until the yoke is centered again the likelihood of a flight attendant immediately finding and successfully engaging the autopilot is only slightly greater than the likelihood of her actually landing the jet safely airplanes don't stall immediately upon pulling the throttle back and 747s have more than one little lever to control the multi engine thrust flaps are lowered in increments usually just prior to and immediately following landing gear extension not seconds before landing good way to crash wheel brakes are required to stop an airplane simply pulling the throttle s this time a different lever in the movie to idle will just allow you to go off the end of the runway at a slower speed did i mention that those fighter aircraft were f 16s and not f 15s guess i didÂ and that's just what i remember from recently watching this horrific movie
<START> the unborn is a roger corman production and as such is nasty and tasteless if you hate pregnant women check out this movie because it's chock full of preggo killings and failed abortions brooke adams stars as virginia her and her square of a husband go to some fancy fertilization clinic because they can't have kids on their own there they meet dr meyerling james karen of rotld 1 2 dr meyerling has had a very high success rate at getting couples pregnant insert joke here is it because he's creating some genetic killer supermutant babies that's what virginia starts to think when she starts having some odd side effects and extreme moodiness from the treatment that's when she starts taking matters into her own hands br br on this one you'll have to get the rest of the details somewhere else because if i told ya all the goodies this one had you might hurt yourself putting it on your netflix rental queue too quickly it's a bit slow moving for a while but once it picks up in the final third all systems are go very highly recommended by me on the strengths of its un pc fetal violence 33 1 2 out of seventeen stars
<START> as alan rudolph's breakfast of champions slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when keith gordon's mother night came out now for all the talk of kurt vonnegut being unfilmable it's surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments the other being slaughter house five mother night is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and i cannot understand why it's brilliant it stays almost entirely faithful to vonnegut's book without being stilted or overly literary and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic how many film adaptations of any author's work can claim that vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film and can you ask for a better endorsement than that not only is it a beautiful film it is a beautifully acted written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so american films of the 1990s it's a mournful inspired surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected i would sincerely encourage anyone to see mother night it doesn't even take a familiarity with vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it as slaughter house five sometimes does it is a powerful affecting piece of cinema
<START> i know i know plan 9 from outer space is the worst movie or maybe manos the hands of fate but i can't get worked up over those sock monkey movies of course they're bad how could they be any good but if you're talking about movies with respectable production values and bankable talent the t rex of all turkeys has to be yentl all the treacly phoniness all the self absorbed asininity that stains everything barbra streisand has done since 1964 reaches its culmination in this movie from its lonely summit of awfulness yentl looks back to a star is born and forward to the mirror has two faces there is nothing else quite like it what emotional undertow dragged streisand out to make this movie i would rather not speculate and what audience she was playing to i cannot possibly imagine although i'll bet there's a nine in ten chance you aren't a member of it br br nobel prize winner and saintly guardian of yiddish literature isaac bashevis singer was so outraged by what streisand did to his story that he blasted her in public for it it is a tribute to streisand's impenetrable vulgarity that she not only didn't commit suicide but went on to make more awful movies
