<START> yes a tap dancing horror thriller with shelley and debbie goody goody this is demented and campy fun and part of the guignol cycle of the 60s that leaked into the 70s released as a double feature with the burt reynolds comedy fuzz this mad scare is so bonkers as to be throughly entertaining like a mix of day of the locust the other and baby jane i suggest any prospective viewer take on the idea that this is almost meant to be skew iff and sit with someone with whom you can shriek and elbow all through it actually get drunk whilst you watch it on cheap champagne again with many 30s film ideas they are also about delusion the struggle of the time for a better life getting bitter and twisted by emotional madness falling into murder but this one is just plain crazy it also reminds me a lot of bloody mama the de niro winters shlock fest that makes this film look positively glorious
<START> a very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting but where the hell is the ending to this film br br in fact what is the point of it br br the scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storyline br br the performances of the cast are questionable if not believable br br did i miss the conclusion somewhere in the film i guess we have to wait for the sequel br br
<START> i've tried to like this film really in watching it all i can think is this guy gives me the creeps i would have gotten a restraining order it also calls out codependence in capital letters was this really the conversation before making the movie let's make a film that puts two chronically depressed socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are from what i've seen in life is that the last thing on earth we find attractive in a potential mate is constant self pity br br the mood of the movie is distinctly 80 ish brooding and slow don't get me wrong the film has its moments just very few of them
<START> br br dull demi going thru the motions ditto prochnow ominous portents that elicit yawns michael biehn trying to be dynamic which ain't his shtick br br to quote buffy summers if the apocalypse comes beep me br br going back to sleep now
<START> this is a must see for anybody who loves thriller's specially political thriller one scene that stands out is milgram experiment it is shot to perfection very rarely do we get to see a movie shot and scripted the way this movie is presented br br the movie starts with a kennedy like assassination and a three member team is constituted to investigate the assassination however one of the member does not agree with the final findings of the committee as per the terms set that member would initiate a one man investigation into the assassination this investigation gets him involved in into to deep and dark secrets of high office politics and the way they are controlled
<START> a comedy of epically funny proportions from the guys that brought you south park and most of the guys from orgazmo this vulgur obscence movie has utterly disgusting eggotistical and satirical content it portrays incredibly cruel treatment of humans and animals i love it this is some funny stuff really funny two loser friends create a game in thier driveway which explodes into a national sensation corruption and greed and blackmail turn the sport sour and its up ta coop ta fix it and along the way you will laugh alot that's all there is enjoy
<START> i rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an academy award but after watching it it's easy to see why it didn't despite the beautiful photography the film is incredibly slow moving despite having hardly any plot br br the plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents' death in what may or may not have been an accident the film is never clear on this and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories the fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot but they're very short and don't really seem to have any point br br the first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient but that doesn't make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure perfect metaphor for this film really br br the photography of skye is beautiful though but then stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in skye and beautifully photographed and it's infinitely better than this one
<START> brilliant my wife and i joined the sprawling line to see holly at the edinburgh film festival after seeing the film i can understand why there was such a long line holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people she is a young girl he is a worn out westerner the film grasped every bone in our body there aren't any graphic scenes or anything that is hard to watch its the surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the gut the film is beautifully shot among others we loved the scene where patrick teaches holly to ride a small motorcycle thuy ngoyen's rawness cant believe this is her first acting job and ron livingston's performance stayed with me for a couple of days highly recommended
<START> this movie is really wack there is really nothing nice i can say about it besides the moral truth expressed in the film's climax concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime besides all that the film had nothing no good shots no good acting and no good script i give this film a f and a 2 out 10
<START> a masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten br br 1 2 a classic in time simply a must see br br a solid worth while very entertaining piece br br 1 2 a good movie but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws br br may still be considered good in areas but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable e g genre br br 1 2 mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile moments br br bomb not of a viewable quality br br kalifornia br br unrated for strong violent material considerable sexuality and language br br i rented this film expecting an in your face summer blockbuster quality celebration of brad pitt's face but was happily surprised and disappointed this really is more of a drama and very grim at that i remember some emotionally intense duchovny voice overs br br pitt plays out his possibly un sexiest film ever with startling talent who started out as a hopeless yet harmless white trash husband became realized as a violent disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind during some of the latter stages in the film i found it hard to keep watching him he was unpredictable and scary this proves very good writing and acting br br the whole movie is filled with bizarre sensational scenes that made me hold my breath not fewer than once and i don't mean action scenes i mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted i actually winced and gasped at what i was seeing it was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching as they gnawed each other to death again i am very impressed with the screenwriter s whoever they are did the impossible mixed oil and water br br i also very much enjoyed juliette lewis's performance it is so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is such a joy some of her moments in this film brought me to tears i mean that the emotions this girl can arouse in your head are incredible and i clearly remember getting blurry eyed on a few occasions br br i almost feel like i'm cheating the quality craftsmanship the film makers have displayed by only giving kalifornia a rating but the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it i do believe that everyone should see this movie though i truly do
<START> higher and higher was one of rodgers hart's lesser broadway musicals it only had a run of 84 performances on broadway in 1940 yet it yielded one of their bigger hits it never entered my mind br br nevertheless except for one minor song so disgustingly rich the entire broadway score was scrapped when rko bought the film rights instead a whole new score by jimmy mchugh and harold adamson was written mostly to accommodate one francis albert sinatra who was making his feature film debut br br sinatra who had done some vocal cameos in previous films takes a leaf from the page of his singing rival bing crosby when bing did his feature film debut in the big broadcast he played bing crosby frank sinatra took on the role of frank sinatra and i can't think of anyone who could have done a better job br br the chairman of the board is billed third here behind stars jack haley and michele morgan he's the butler and she's the scullery maid to leon errol in fact errol is a millionaire who hasn't paid his help for seven months mainly because he's about to go belly up into chapter 11 or so he informs the staff br br errol's a delightful old soul to work for and none of the staff want to lose a good thing they pool their resources and get michele morgan to impersonate errol's daughter who's over in switzerland with her mother the idea being to snag a rich bankroll in the hopes rescuing the family fortune only michele starts looking at another br br it's a slight plot and certainly no worse than a whole lot of musicals but rko invested this film with a good cast of players barbara hale and elizabeth risdon play another dÃ©butante and her mother who suspect something's not right victor borge is a fortune seeking no account dooley wilson paul hartman grace hartman marcy mcguire mel torme and mary wickes play others of the errol household staff not a bad bunch at all br br sinatra sang three good ballads all of them had some kind of commercial success the music stopped a lovely way to spend an evening and i couldn't sleep a wink last night the last one was nominated for an oscar for best song but lost to alice faye's you'll never know br br 1943 was the year of the musician's union strike against the recording industry to get their material out frank sinatra recorded the songs from higher and higher with an acapella chorus for columbia bing crosby recorded songs from his film dixie in the same manner for decca both of them were denounced by the president of the union james c petrillo as strikebreakers and both did not cross the picket line again the strike wasn't settle completely until 1944 although decca broke ranks earlier from the other record companies and settled earlier than columbia rca victor and the others br br the strike provided some anxious moments for sinatra he had just left the tommy dorsey orchestra when the strike was called it closed off a needed venue for his artistry when he wasn't sure whether leaving dorsey would prove to be a right career move br br fortunately higher and higher was received well a legend was launched
<START> i disagree with previous comment about this movie i think it was cute and fun and it carried a good message for young girls like my daughter you don't have to dress like a cheap hooker to be cool you can be smart and pretty and classy all at once br br i think the cast was good and the story was fine for the target audience all in all my wife daughter 10 and i each thought it was a good movie i certainly recommend it it also has encouraged my daughter to start reading the original nancy drew mysteries which i am sure she will love much as i loved the hardy boys br br it was a struggle to get her to sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away i can't think of a better outcome for that movie than rekindling interest in that classic series
<START> reading web sites on bette davis one can find instances where authors claim that there is nothing special about her acting i even found a site which claimed that bette davis' success was probably due to her luck but ms davis films of 1934 tell quite the opposite the most evident example are two films that she did only few weeks apart fog over frisco and on human bondage characters she played in these movies though both being negative are quite different arlene in the former is a beautiful glamorous and frivolous heiress and much more likable character than mildred in the latter which is a pale uneducated and impudent cockney waitress needless to say that ms davis played both characters very authentic and with the same enthusiasm but even that is not all the point is that the former role which would be wished by most actresses of the day was the one she was forced to play the latter role which seemed to most actresses as undesirable career destroying role was the one she fought for ferociously for months and it was the latter role that launched her among the greatest stars so there is no question that ms davis knew from the start what she was doing br br the film which tells about a medical student phillip carey leslie howard which falls unhappily in love with cockney waitress mildred rogers bette davis has a few week points but many more strong ones the story is simply too big to be told in mere 83 minutes for example it is quite unclear why refined student found any interest in an impudent waitress in the first place well there is one scene in which we are exposed to ms davis captivating eyes but this is when his emotions are already fully evolved nevertheless the integrity of the story is preserved by superior acting from howard and davis as well as fantastic steiner's music which tells tons of emotions even when we do not see characters' faces in fact the film is amalgamated by phillip's walking sequences showing him from the back supplemented with shuddering two tone repetition every detail is well thought max steiner wrote a beautiful leitmotif for each women in phillip's life which is consistently used through the film and a beautiful scene in which we see sally's face in front of calendar is one of the sweetest scenes i've ever seen exactly due to francis dee's breathtaking beauty ms dee was by the way considered to be too beautiful to play leading role in gone with a wind as well as steiner's captivating music camera movements between the some scenes is also original and refreshing br br but my strongest objection is that events are presented too two dimensionally which induce viewer that mildred is an ultimate slut the most disgusting characters ought to be men which lure her into relationship despite well knowing that they will abandon her after taking use of her but they curiously finished portrayed as likable characters after all mildred always in her own specific but still a honest way lets phillip know that she despises him and had no interest in him which he just refuses to hear it is phillips masochistic nature connected to his club foot and infantile experiences that is the principal reason of his love problem he is enslaved to his club foot as much as to mildred and perhaps has to be free of both to start a normal life of course selfish and impudent mildred after discovering voluntary phillip's bondage to her did its own share to make his life hell even taking into account that she exploded after realizing that the bondage has loosen it is less than clear why would she burn phillip's money maugham intended different in his novel after all she could as well steal it and drunk gallons of champagne br br for modern standards the film is a bit outdated but each subsequent time you watch it you can reveal new interesting details due to superior acting fascinating music and original editing so it does deserve the highest possible mark
<START> any movie with national lampoon in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die a death in london england paris france rome italy and anywhere in germany it may be an institution in the u s but it is practically unknown in europe to the larger audience national lampoon's european vacation is unlikely to rectify that situation the appalling griswalds are just that appalling they are not funny clearly mr chevy chase thinks he's funny after all miss b di angelo laughs a lot at his jokes but she's getting paid for it and didn't have to fork out Â£2 50 for the privilege the section set in england is typical the same old same old tv performers messrs idle smith coltrane miss m lippman trot out the same old same old tired clichÃ©s mr chase gets lost in the hotel corridor yawn yawn yawn bucking ham palace big ben i feel cheated that we never saw bobbies on bicycles two by two rosie red cheeks on the little chil dren need i go on the english are buffoons the french vicious tongued yank haters the germans pompous and puffed up don't mention the war clark and the italians lecherous bottom pinchers have i forgotten anything every possible comic situation is worked to death mr chase gurns desperately miss di angelo dimples sweetly the children are embarrassingly bad the fact that this franchise ran as long as it did must bring comfort to those who propound that you never lose money by underestimating public taste
<START> right from the start you see that anchors aweigh is a great comedy gene kelly and frank sinatra make such a funny team the songs they sing together are pure entertainment kathryn grayson is gorgeous and really sweet dean stockwell is the cutiest child actor i've never seen if you are fond of piano you'll be amazed by josÃ© iturbi this movie was the first one to combine animation with real actors and it did that wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number undoubtedly one of kelly's funniest movies
<START> piece is cake is defeatist revisionist history of the worst kind whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the admittedly fictional pilots it portrays it left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth br br in the march 1989 aeroplane monthly roland beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way that raf fighter command was portrayed in the tv mini series a few of his comments are worth repeating br br there was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadrons that i saw in action and a total absence of the loutishness portrayed in 'piece of cake' it would not have been tolerated for a moment the prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that in a good rugby club though with more discipline nor was there any sense of 'death or glory' raf training had insisted that we were there to defend this country and now we were required to do it no more and no less br br there was no discussion of 'bravery' or 'cowardice' people either had guts or they did not but mostly they did but we knew fear recognised it in ourselves and in each other did our damnedness to control it and then got on with the job br br i could feel no 'glory' but there was a sense of greatness and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to 'piece of cake' br br beamont was in his own words a fighter pilot who unlike the author and producer of the recent tv series was there at the time br br beamont served with 87 squadron both in france and the bob before going on to become one of the premier exponents of both the typhoon and tempest and a post war test pilot br br piece of cake is an absolute total misrepresentation of the way pilots in fighter command acted at the time it is nothing less than a complete and utter disgrace
<START> somehow a woman working with a scientist puts round metal balls into people's mouths that supposedly changes their personality but in reality turns them into crazed zombie like killers the guinea pigs for the experiment are scantily clad nubile young women in desperate need of acting lessons this movie is awful atrocious and amazingly bad it has little to no logic in the script you really will have trouble following what is going on it has no special effects the computer screen that is supposedly representing a huge scientific advancement looks nothing more than an old atari screen and what is even worse is that there is also a puppet with strands of felt hair looks like a lonely kid at summer camp made it named george that is like a personal servant confidant to jessica the leading actress throughout the movie you will be subjected to the idiotic sophmoric utterings of this puppet but wait you also get loads of softcore unerotic barely nude scenes with the girls with some bar guys all the while a most annoying soundtrack plays in the background like some kind of spiritual discovery has taken place none of the actors are good there are just varying degrees of bad the gore and horror aspects are especially ineptly filmed the film really looks like an adolescent put it together no coincidence henry sala the director by name but not by trade has not made another film i was bored almost into a coma watching this stupid silly dreck and how bout the ending what happened if you know let me in on the secret because for the life of me i cannot figure it out all i know is that i lost the time spent watching this garbage that made the beginning of my weekend a real nightmare of a bore
<START> dolph lundgren broods and scowls his way through this incoherent mystery thriller that's not nearly as cool as the box would have you believe he is actually quite good here but the story is a mess of b movie cliches detectives revenge tycoons hookers s m that looks like it was made up as they went along the film picks up a bit in the second half but for a more decent lundgren flick rent red scorpion instead
<START> let us begin by saying that this film's english title the power of kangwon province is an absolute misnomer it is because in hong sang soo's film there are no actual shots of wars troubles and conflicts so the idea of establishing power of a province is neither suitable nor valid in the context of this film if we were to judge this film by its korean language title kangwon do ui him is going to appear as a cryptic statement about emotional turmoils of its young protagonists whose minds are not at rest hong sang soo has also directed a highly prolific visual document about erratic choices made by people in their lives the people in question are a couple of young girls who are constantly in the process of displaying their moods whims and fancies if making a film out of nothingness can be claimed as a film maker's meritorious virtue then hong sang soo has to be saluted as a courageous film maker whose films speak volumes about ubiquitous nothingness of human relationships sentiments and lives whether one likes it or not this is the only fair conclusion that be deduced from this particular film
<START> i sat through both parts of che last night back to back with a brief bathroom break and i can't recall when 4 hours last passed so quickly i'd had to psyche myself up for a week in advance because i have a real 'thing' about directors producers and editors who keep putting over blown over long quasi epics in front of us and i feel that on the whole 2 to 2 5 hours is about right for a movie so 4 hours seemed to be stretching the limits of my tolerance and i was very dubious about the whole enterprise but i will say upfront that this is a beautifully Â i might say lovingly Â made movie and i'm really glad i saw it director steven soderbergh is to be congratulated on the clarity of his vision the battle scenes zing as if you were dodging the bullets yourself br br if there is a person on the planet who doesn't know ernesto 'che' guevara was the argentinian doctor who helped fidel castro overthrow fulgencio batista via the 1959 cuban revolution when i was a kid in the 1960s che's image was everywhere on bedroom wall posters on t shirts on magazine covers che's image has to be one of the most over exploited ever if the famous images are to be relied on then che was a very good looking guy the epitome of revolutionary romanticism had he been butt ugly i have to wonder if he would have ever been quite so popular in the public imagination of course dying young helps br br movies have been made about che before notably the excellent motorcycle diaries of 2004 which starred the unbearably cute gael garcia bernal as young che touring south america and seeing the endemic poverty which formed his marxist politics but i don't think anyone has ever tackled the entire story from beginning to end and this two parter is an ambitious project i hope it pays off for soderbergh but i can only imagine that instant commercial success may not have been uppermost in his mind br br the first movie the agentine shows che meeting castro in mexico and follows their journey to cuba to start the revolution and then the journey to new york in 1964 to address the un cleverly shot black and white images look like contemporary film but aren't the second film guerilla picks up again in 1966 when che arrives in bolivia to start a new revolutionary movement the second movie takes place almost entirely in the forest as far as i can see it was shot mostly in spain but i can still believe it must have been quite grueling to film benicio del toro is excellent as che a part he seems born to play br br personally i felt that the argentine ie part one was much easier to watch and more 'entertaining' in the strictly movie sense because it is upbeat they are winning the revolution will succeed che is in his element leading a disparate band of peasants workers and intellectuals in the revolutionary cause the second part is much harder to watch because of the inevitability of his defeat in much the same way that the recent valkyrie while being a good movie was an exercise in witnessing heroic failure so i felt the same about part two of che guerilla we know at the outset that he dies we know he fails it is frustrating because the way the story is told it is obvious fairly early on that the fomentation of revolution in bolivia is doomed che is regarded as a foreign intruder and fails to connect with the indigenous peoples in the way that he did with the cubans he doggedly persists which is frustrating to watch because i felt that he should have known when to give up and move on to other perhaps more successful enterprises the movie does not romanticise him too much he kills people he executes he struggles with his asthma and follows a lost cause long after he should have given up and moved on he leaves a wife alone to bring up five fatherless children br br but overall an excellent exercise in classic movie making one note as i watched the us trained bolivian soldiers move in en masse to pick off che and his small band of warriors one by one it reminded me of the finale to butch cassidy i almost turned to my husband and said so but hesitated thinking he would find such thoughts trite and out of place as we left the theatre he turned to me and said didn't you think the end was like butch cassidyÂÂÂÂÂÂ
