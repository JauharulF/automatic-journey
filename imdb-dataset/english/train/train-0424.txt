<START> this has to be the worst film i have ever seen i bought the dvd and it didn't work well the dvd worked fine its just the film didn't in fact its so bad that i think non of the actors have worked since or before judging from the acting there is no real plot to speak of and no real horror the production values are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to wind on the microphone br br all in all it was so bad a film that a viewer could think it was going to turn into a porno if they didn't know any better which have been an improvement there are only two lines in the film that are funny both of which revolve around the transvestite prostitute although they hardly merit watching all 76 minutes for br br as for the marketing of the dvd i feel thoroughly cheated i mean reading the back i expected it to be bad br br he chose his weapons he selected his victims he picked his nose he turned into a girl br br but i thought it might be funny also the case claims it is digitally re mastered i would love to have seen it beforehand the print is so grainy you could use it as sand paper the case also says it is an absolute disgusting movie in what way disgusting production acting br br this film out stays it welcome in the first five minutes if you are considering buying this i would say buy bad taste' instead it is a much better film and is funny also it has peter jackson the director of the lotr in it br br incidentally if anyone knows anything about any of the actors or director patrick j mathews and what they have done since please post here as i would love to know purely to find out if there is a worse movie out there or if anyone in this film ever bothered to learn to act
<START> i consider stuart bliss the worst movie i have ever seen br br the acting was terrible and the plot ludicrous i get the fact that the main character's wife leaving him triggered a mental breakdown but it got so silly and boring after a while i could have cared less about any of the characters br br the movie kept going over and over the same ideas without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot the whole thing with the geiger counter got too much after a while after stuart started opening up his wall to see what was behind it after the counter indicated something was there br br then there was the repetitive scenes with the flyer and the confusing ones where he meets himself br br i should have guessed that this movie was a flop when i didn't recognize any of the actors do yourself a favor when this movie comes up read a book you'll be better off
<START> this show was a landmark in american comedy as it was the first sitcom to star an all afro american cast sadly though it was never broad casted on british tv br br the evans family are a poor afro american family living in a tower block the dad is called james he tries to run the house but his wife florida always gets the better of him the three children are the artistic jj the moody thelma and the young intellectual child michael always coming into the house is florida's gossipy friend willona br br i watched two episodes of this show on youtube black jesus and sex and the evans family the only two on the site you may be thinking why has an english viewer watched a series that has never been shown or hardly heard of in his country the answer is this in 1976 britains first all black sitcom came out called the fosters only two series were made and it now seems forgotten but i watched an episode and was really impressed then i learnt that the scripts were identical to good times they were exactly the same characters but with different names sam foster was the dad his wife was pearl foster and the three children were sonny a young lenny henry shirley and benjamin pearl's gossipy friend was vilma to read about the fosters i have wrote a review about that whilst watching good times only two things annoyed me first off was the opening theme tune awful and secondly was the audience laughter i like audience laughter but in this somebody would say a slightly funny line and the audience would go mad and start clapping apart from that it was a very funny show let's hope more episodes turn up on youtube and lets hope that someone will release the fosters on dvd in england br br best episode sex and the evans family series 1 episode 6 the foster's episode of it was called sex in the black community the other episode i saw black jesus was a title of one episode of the fosters
<START> in 1943 a group of raf officers including eric wiiliams decide to escape from a pow camp using a gymnastic vaulting horse in the courtyard in 1950 it was decided to film his account and it kick started a peculiar british film genre the military prison camp story that reached its apogee in danger within 1959 br br the wooden horse is one of the quietest films i have ever watched there are no great dramatic moments but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn't give way for unlikely drama jump cuts or jacked up somethings about to happen music it is utterly of its time and works beautifully br br leo glenn anthony steel and david tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and i suspect non actors without exception all are constantly mono tonal and quiet they keep emotion out of their roles as so many were until recently ex service i suspect they recreated their war time roles as 'officers and gentlemen' br br this unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension on the contrary unlike most wartime escape films the story doesn't end at the barbed wire and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end
<START> in a performance both volatile and graceful al pacino re teams with sea of love director harold becker br br as new york mayor john pappas in city hall br br a savvy thriller thats the first film ever shot inside the lower manhattan structure that's ground zero for the city's government br br that the other nyc locations provide the vivid settings as an idealistic mayoral aide john cusack follows a trail of subversion and cover up that may loop back to the man he serves and reveres br br bridget fonda danny aiello martin landau tony franciosa and david paymer add more starry brilliance to this gripping tale of power br br and the power behind power
<START> here i thought nanook of the north was the last word in archaic semi doc 'eskimo' movies how wrong as an avid sea kayaker i stayed up till 330am to watch this hoping to get a glimpse of some hand made 'skin boats' the movie did not let me down any student of kayak umiak construction should have a look see here note to fellow skers they appear to be using norton sound kayaks with single blade paddles br br but the film went way beyond this admittedly narrow interest even though there were as others have noted some little back shot fakey bits the movie has so much heart they are just a minor annoyance it was from this very amateur anthropologist's viewpoint probably the perfect time to make this movie early thirties the 'talkies' are so new that they including louie b mayer actually let the inuit speak in their own tongue and there is so much that was still despite the infused melodrama authentic they are really whacking that polar bear that whale and those caribou a fifties version of this film would have been so cheesy with 'stars' technicolor etc to gum it up the seventies version don't even a very good companion piece to this excellent movie is white shadows in the south seas 1928 geograpically the mirror image to eskimo it also deals with the relentless and profound disruption of western culture technology on an unsuspecting people
<START> spirit stallion of the cimarron is an overall wonderful movie the blending of animation types is unique the storyline is amazing and the music is wonderful br br the drawn animation is a special thing about many animations how they expressed the characters especially the horses through their animation are spectacular especially while the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand many young children and people who haven't studied horses might not understand without words i would imagine it would have to be challenging to express them through the features because of this i understand the 'eyebrow' they added to the horses while real horses don't have those thick lines one of the few things i noticed about horse habits that might have been portrayed strangely is that spirit lead his mother's herd in wild horse herds the lead stallion usually chases the young colts out br br also while some people might think portraying the white army officers as the 'bad guys' is stereotyping think of all the movies in which the native americans have been portrayed as that sometimes back then they did treat mustangs very poorly for example in real history the appaloosa breed was almost wiped out due to the army officers imagine what would have happened to one of the worlds best loved riding breeds if the native americans had not saved them br br i think it's amazing how the realism wasn't subtracted by making the horses talk to each other spirit's feelings were expressed by a little bit of narration but mostly through the music by bryan adams the songs express the story really well and hans zimmer and bryan adams did a great job telling the story through melodies and lyrics br br the emotion i got when watching the movie whether the first time or the twentieth yes i've watched it that much you wouldn't believe some of the scenes take your breath away while others seem to force tears into your eyes the opening sequence showing spirit's homeland puts you right into the spectacular action right away br br i don't understand at all why some people are so hateful of this brilliant movie overall i rate it a 10 10 a must watch
<START> clearly an hilarious movie br br it angers me to see the poor ratings given to this piece of comic genius br br please look at this for what it is a funny ridiculous enjoyable film laugh for christ sake br br
<START> i don't remember ever seeing this one before tonight probably the title sounded so ordinary it kept passing me by but it is a well crafted b western with an interestingly brooding storyline complimented by acting veering from the good to corny br br robert mitchum slopes into wide open town looking for his wife and news of their daughter and stays for a time as town tamer as usual the good business folk have mixed emotions they want to get rid of the baddies but like the business they bring it still applies relax drink and gambling laws and encourage the industries but pretend to deplore the seedy effects it can have on ordinary people what's fascinating about this film is mitchum's cynically intense portrayal in going about cleaning the town of baddies and the townsfolk's acceptance that his violent methods were the only ones favourite bit the sudden demise of 2 of the baddies in the red dog saloon the firing of the main saloon bordered on nasty but it was an effective way to combat the spread of poison br br overall a very good film with its only fault tending to be a little hokeyness not so good for do gooders who would probably prefer a lifetime of negotiation with evil rather than end it
<START> for a no budget movie this thing rocks i don't know if america's gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through some really funny funny stuff really non hollywood br br the actors and music rocked the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up whooo whooo br br i've seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them i think i've seen in commercials or in something somewhere basically it rocked luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors
<START> first it was jack the ripper now it is alan feinstone the crazy dentist tortures people in horrific ways quite realistic at times but some of the acting is abysmal and comical especially from corbin bernson in some scenes there is dental torture that will really make you cringe
<START> i had high hopes for this film i thought the premise interesting i stuck through it even though i found the acting save helena bonham carter unremarkable i kept hoping my time spent would pay off but in the end i was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing maybe in george orwell's version there is a message worth conveying if this film accomplished anything it has inspired me to read orwell's classic i find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption if the film maker's message is the mundane life is worth living well then they've succeeded i would recommend this film to no one 101 minutes of my life wasted
<START> but it was on a uhf channel and the reception was very fuzzy i'd really like to own the movie since the reason i watched it in the first place is because i am a bus driver and at the time i saw this movie i was driving that model bus it was only during his murder trial some 15 years later that i remember vaguely that oj was one of the stars in it i only recall that he was the driver and of the bus' being shot up and driven wildly i've been looking all over for this movie to no avail since viewing it in the mid 80s i liked the movie i don't usually watch thrillers but after reading the summary in the tv guide and viewing its beginning although fuzzy i stayed for the whole thing
<START> meryl streep is such a genius well at least as an actress i know she's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents but she nails the accent every time her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring mrs chamberlain as portrayed here was not particularly likable nor all that smart but that just makes streep's work all the more remarkable i think she is worth all 10 or so of her oscar nominations about the film well there were a couple of interesting things i don't know much about australia but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago but it came through loud and clear yesterday and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues a pretty good film a bit different grade b
<START> ok this movie could have been soooo good all generations have been exposed to thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie the craft themselves and tracey island were realistically transferred to the big screen whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with sophia miles was simply fantastic as lady p and bill paxton whilst not exactly who i envisaged jeff tracey being was solid enough but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines br br it's not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like jonathon frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film it was the fact that alan tracey was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brothers who were at least 19 20 seriously these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case br br the film didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical it tried to pay homage whilst satirising and it just generally fell flat on its face 3 10 2 for the machines 1 for lady p
<START> have never understood why the macdonald eddy swan song has always been panned so mercilessly not just by their detractors but by virtually everyone to me i married an angel is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo's more celebrated outings the sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an mgm musical the script is by the reliable anita loos san francisco the women gentlemen prefer blondes etc the rodgers and hart tunes albeit altered a bit by macdonald eddy regulars bob wright and chet forrest are given celestial treatment by herbert stothart oscar winner for scoring the wizard of oz and best of all the singing sweethearts look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings try to show rose marie or sweethearts to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still but this offbeat fast paced fantasy is bound to entertain
<START> i couldn't find anyone to watch dig with me because no one i knew was a fan of either of the bands naturally everyone assumed you can only enjoy this film if you like the music of either the dandy warhols or the brian jonestown massacre but this is so far from the truth the only requirement is that you have an interest in music and or pop culture in general the way in which the careers of the two groups are paralleled is a perfect representation of the paths a band can take and watching the public eat up and spit out the dandy warhols is fascinating i agree with other reviews that mention it would be nice to get a final word from anton himself since he's clearly depicted as his own worst enemy and the bulwark to the band's ability to just remain br br most interesting to me is the dandys' respect for the bjm despite their lack or reciprocation and for anton despite his erratic behavior the dandy warhols respect the art the group produces even if the group hates everything the dandy warhols now stand for although that's disputable the best line is when the drummer for the dandy's says i won't have them anywhere new me again and the guitarist unconsciously blurts out i'll still buy their records though to me this just shows how powerful good music can be br br definitely see this movie even if you know nothing of either band it's more about the themes of rock music and how they develop that makes this film so interesting it's rare to follow a group so closely for so long
<START> les visiteurs the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny i like jean reno as an actor but there was more there were unexpected twists funny situations and of course plain absurdness that would remind you a little bit of louis de funes br br now this sequel has the same characters the same actors in great part and the same time traveling the plot changes a little since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers so they jump up and down in history without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie the duke jean reno tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing but his character has been emptied so there's not a lot he can do to save the film br br now the duke's slave helper he has really all the attention the movie is merely about him and his being clumsy annoying stupid or whatever he was supposed to be fact is this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience but he does not succeed it is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke you already know but he insists on telling that joke till the end adding details to make your suffering a little longer br br if you liked les visiteurs do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel if you didn't like les visiteurs you would never consider seeing the sequel if you liked this sequel well i suppose you still need to see a lot of movies
<START> i just saw the drugs years on vh1 and i love it i think it reflects the drug history very well and most importantly it has a strong message to the all generations there is woodstock there are joplin's hendrix's and jim morrison's deaths there are many many examples of drug use and drug abuse it completely cover the time line and evolution of drug use in america in both good and bad ways in my opinion this documentary is well done and i would like to congratulate to its creators because this is exactly what is needed to be playing in the tv in these days i am waiting for the dvd release you should definitely see it this movie is stunning big time
<START> the house of the dead was the worst movie i have ever seen between the pathetic 'matrix' 360 camera angle attemps and the cheesy acting i fell asleep i don't think that the director and set manager could decide whether it was raining or not because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other i would rate this movie a 1 out of 10 10 being the best 1 being the worst also jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying it makes you wonder if they were just making up for lose time i beg anyone who reads this not to see it it's not worth the time
