<START> the silent film the pride of the clan starring mary pickford was supposed to be set in a fictional island off the coast of scotland in actuality most of the exterior shots were filmed in marblehead massachusett on marblehead neck near several rocky seaside geographic areas including the churn and castle rock my initial interest in the film was because of two factors 1 the marblehead film location in my hometown and 2 the fact that my grandmother lizzette m woodfin was hired as a stand in for mary pickford during filming of several scenes including the cliff scene both women were small 5' in stature and both my father and grandmother related the fact that she was a stand in with her back to the camera for the cliff scene as part of the chiefton filming set i just wanted to relate this story for future film historians and buffs the film itself my dvd copy is somewhat poor is very well done with lots of action and expressive acting including several scenes where miss pickford portrays a strong woman characterization i enjoyed it and would love to get a better copy of it although i am unsure whether one exists as i have seen in various movie sites that remaining copies are dark because of deterioration a very nice film of the silent genre with lots of action
<START> i saw this at the premiere in melbourne br br it is shallow two dimensional unaffecting and hard to believe given the subject matter boring the actors are passable but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script for those who might have worried that ned kelly would be over intellectualised you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards however it doesn't work as a popcorn film either its pacing is too off kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner br br i very much doubt gregor jordan could sit back and say to himself this is the best i could have done with the material br br ned kelly is a fascinating figure and equally so is the national response to him possibly folk genius possibly class warrior possibly psychopath and probably all these things he has dominated australian true mythology for over 120 years once again his story has failed miserably on the big screen br br such is life
<START> in 1988 paperhouse was hailed as a thinking man's horror film wow you might say sign me up this thing is a mess it features a one time young actress who has a range of like 1 to 2 g headley with a bad british dubbed accent and a story with no chills thrills or spills br br it isn't even interesting psycho babble one will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of leprechaun 5 br br the story involves a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams what you get isn't good horror art house or even a decent after school special i found myself after the two hour point saying where did my two hours go br br the direction is uninspired and i wished it could even be pretentious something interesting it seems like the producers were on lithium br br even in the dream world things are boring br br a short no on this one
<START> jimmy stewart and anthony mann teamed to do some of the best westerns ever made and this is one of the best br br the real star of the film however is the spectacular canadian rockies that serve as a backdrop for the story some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of film br br in all five of the westerns that stewart and mann did together the supporting roles were perfectly cast no exception here right down to parts that might only have a few lines the characters are firmly etched with those lines br br stewart is a cynical hard bitten loner in this film whose only real friend is his sidekick walter brennan it's brennan's death at the hands of the villains that makes him want to finally free the gold settlement from the bad guys and incidentally redeem himself in the process br br john mcintire is the head villain of the piece and he was an under appreciated actor with a vast range he could play delightful old codgers authority figures and in this case a particularly nasty and crafty villain br br one of the best westerns ever
<START> that was definitely the case with angels in the outfield it was on tv last night and i believe i hadn't seen the film since my sophomore year in high school and i'm now in my 4th year of college although the film has many flaws it is just so touching that you can't help but sit down watch it and enjoy yourself it is also hilarious danny glover's ranting is just so over the top that you can't help but laugh out loud at him at most time it adds to the film and i'm sure it's exactly what the director wanted you actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isn't the best a must see i highly recommend br br 8 10
<START> if you like adult comedy cartoons like south park then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at bromwell high keisha natella and latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches i think keisha is a good leader there are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school there's the idiotic principal mr bip the nervous maths teacher and many others the cast is also fantastic lenny henry's gina yashere eastenders chrissie watts tracy ann oberman smack the pony's doon mackichan dead ringers' mark perry and blunder's nina conti i didn't know this came from canada but it is very good very good
<START> after reading through many of the reviews i don't know what movie some people were watching but clearly it wasn't the same one i saw br br this movie is horrible the acting primarily moore's is just terrible the woman cannot act nice tits but she just can't act at no point did she come across as the actual character instead it was spoiled hollywood actress goes to the beach to play make believe with the boys br br and that's what this movie ultimately is hollywood make believe the training sequences are over the top the politics over the top the political correctness over the top the combat scenes you guessed it over the top your mission is to get in and get out without being detected so what do you do why shoot off as many rounds and make as much noise as possible of course oh g i jane you can be my wing man anytime br br the premise is good but as soon as hollywood gets a hold of it we end up with top gun with tits br br what more is to be expected from commercial us films anymore not much i guess
<START> there is a level of high expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy with a cast headed by cary grant jayne mansfield ray walston and werner klemperer those expectations are buoyed further when the film is directed by stanley donen whose comic touch was so evident in among others damn yankees bedazzled and charade for the first five minutes or so it seems that those expectations might be met and thenÂ nothing what is supposed to be a light comedy plunges into leaden heavy handed melodrama with nary a chuckle to be had br br relative newcomer suzy parker has often been criticized for her performance or lack of one in this film but in a movie in which even the great cary grant frequently appears flat and wooden attacking parker seems unfair not even as bright a light as an audrey hepburn or doris day could have changed the fortunes of this meandering dreary and wholly pointless script which drags itself lamely along and drags the viewer's interest and patience down with it br br the rest of the cast especially ray walston keep trying to breath some life into the proceedings but the horrible script is beyond resuscitation the desperate inane effort to drag a half hearted laugh from the numbed audience in the film's final moments only serves to add insult to injury br br this film is nothing but a major disappointment on all levels
<START> and how many actors can he get to stand in for his own neurotic compulsive uber new yorker persona in this film woody is played by will ferrell in what is mercifully less a direct impersonation than the one kenneth branagh did in celebrity it's an annoyingly repetitive story now nebbishy neurotic man with a wife or girlfriend falls madly in love with a shiksa queen upon which he projects all manner of perfection everyone lives in perfect gigantic apartments in great manhattan neighborhoods everyone constantly patronizes expensive exclusive restaurants during which all the characters relate fascinating anecdotes and discuss arcane philosophy there is always a trip to the hamptons during which the nebbishy main character spazzes out about sand and physical exertion and possible exposure to diseases and then of course said main character feels guilty about his lust for the shiksa queen but pursues her anyway sometimes succeeding sometimes failing etc br br this a tired formula and proof that allen isn't really a great film artist at all he just seems like a dirty old man with the libido and emotions of a 20 year old who is intent upon telling the same boring old stories again and again
<START> basically take the concept of every asian horror ghost movie and smash it into one and you get this movie the story goes like this a bunch of college kids get voice mails from their own phones that are foretelling their deaths there's some s going on with ghosts which if you've seen any asian ghost movie isn't scary by now this movie was quite upsetting because it's very clichÃ©d it's the same bullcrap different movie br br the acting was pretty good unfortunately the actors are put into a very ring esquire situation so it's nothing we haven't seen in the past the two lead acts did a solid job though br br as far as gore there's not much going on we get a cool sequence that includes an arm twisting a head off i don't know how else to explain that but it was cut away so you don't see anything except the final result you see some blood at times including decapitated arms and a zombie that looked really cool i might add but this movie isn't too bloody br br the scares in the movie are few and spread out and it's really not that scary you'll get some creepy images at times but it's not enough for me to consider scary it's nothing different from ringu ju on or dark water and none of those scared me either that's really the downfall of this and most asian horror movies is that if it doesn't deliver the scares then it's just not that good br br as far as directing takashi miike still did a pretty good job he seemed a little tamed in this movie compared to his past movies but he still portrays a lot of his messed up style he's become famous for a lot of images were a lot like miike including a scene with a bunch of jars of dead fetuses and the last 15 20 minutes seemed far more miike then the rest of the movie still the movie is flawed by its unoriginality br br i would recommend this only to people who are huge on asian horror movies even if you are i can recommend much better or big miike fans warning to those who want to get into miike this is not his best work br br i'm giving it a 4 because it's just mediocre perhaps if this was released 4 or 5 years ago it might be worth a higher rating br br also i'd like to b about asian horror movies real quick how come if it's an asian horror movie it's automatically suppose to be good over here us a lot of these movies are the equivalent in japan to what scream urban legends and i know what you did last summer were over here in the 90's if you've seen one you've seen them all and a lot of these movies rely way too much on scares and imagery that if it doesn't deliver the scares they set out to do then they're just not that good and nothing would change that more asian horror films need to be more like audition and a tale of two sisters two movies that if they don't frighten or scare you at least they have great stories acting direction cinematography and much more to back them up two movies that aren't just great horror movies but great movies in general more asian horror movies need to be like these instead of the clichÃ© a ghost just wanted to be found so it went around killing people through their phone video tape house electric appliance water pipes google search engine vibrator groceries etc
<START> it's not very often a movie can literally make the entire audience laugh and five minutes later fill their eyes with tears many movies try to do this but few can deliver the emotional impact that this film did adam sandler practically drags you in with his heated and often violent outbursts but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past isn't pulling him down i'm not going to ruin anything but there is one scene in particular that should have your eyes watering and lip quivering even the most macho of men would have to be heartless bastards to not feel something while watching this movie don cheadle gives another great performance but is out shined by sandler liv tyler and jada pinkett smith give solid performances but nothing in the line of the two leading roles sandler's humor is still present which actually saved this film from being border line depressing there are several laughs to be had but don't think you will stay there long because it gets serious again without much warning br br i could go on and on about how well this movie hit on just about every emotion the human body contains but i will cut this one short i feel there is no need to tell you anything more do yourself a favor and take the time to see this movie even if you have to wait until it comes out on dvd it's 100 worth the time a deeply moving film sure to put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face unless of course you are a heartless soul
<START> i saw this back in '94 when it was finally released apparently because orion pictures was in bankruptcy i think the movie had not been released a couple of years earlier br br i have problem remembering details partly because i haven't seen it in a long time but i do remember it as a very dull movie i kept debating whether to walk out of it the store was not at all interesting or engaging was a 3rd rate america graffiti imitation br br none of the performances make it worth watching either one of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating
<START> years ago i did follow a soap on tv so i was curious about this movie and i was so rewarded for finding it it's a marvelous spoof of soaps with jealousies the usual actors' insecurities and all sorts of lovely excesses but more than anything an amazing cast and an incredible script how did someone get all those top notch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie and how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines i never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit hearing of it but it's marvelous and i highly recommend seeing it sometimes i'll throw it on while doing housecleaning and end up sitting on the couch watching laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonderful thing many congrats to all who made it
<START> this was director von stroheim's third effort it is quite crude and shows none of the exceptional flair for the camera and editing mastery he would display a few years later with his masterworks greed and the wedding march essentially we have a trio of grifters masquerading as a russian count and two russian princesses who have rented a villa in monte carlo their aim is to use counterfeit money at the gambling tables and win a fortune part of that plan is for the count von stroheim to insinuate himself between a visiting american ambassador and his foolish wife wooing her and hoping to gain some money by playing on her weaknesses he makes the mistake of also taking the life savings of the maid whom he has promised to marry when she sees them together she sets fire to the room von stroheim and his prey are on the room's balcony here von stroheim first establishes his persona as the man you love to hate he is thoroughly bad and his character flaws eventually bring him to a very bad and deserved end the film is crude in its cinematography and editing and not worth seeing unless you are fascinated by the director there is a cute bit when he first attempts to meet the ambassador's wife she is reading a book we see the title foolish wives by erich von stroheim this was originally envisioned as a 210 minute film cut down to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released at 70 minutes the restoration on kino video restores surviving footage damaged in some way in most scenes from the alternate earlier version to give us a 107 minute print
<START> i remember seeing this in a the salem movie theater where i used to attend kiddie matinÃ©e s almost every saturday in dayton ohio when i was a young boy and have never forgotten it it simply amazed me and my friends i do wish there were some way i could see it again i have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail i only recently discovered that it was a cousteau film and that blew my mind even more how the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding the fish is actually in the cat's mouth at one point if i remember correctly if anyone could help me find a way to see it again i would be extremely grateful
<START> i remember watching this as a child in the uk mesmerized by the story and laurence olivier's narration we would talk about nothing else at school the next day i imagine the ratings for the first showing were huge this is quite simply the best most comprehensive documentary series despite the fact they had to cut the story down to the bone they managed to capture so much what is interesting is that the battles of britain and north africa were pivotal yet are widely unrecognized as such by americans the series captures the rivalry between mountbatten and the american generals the suffering of german troops on the eastern front the maltreatment of japanese prisoners of war by american troops the images of the holocaust made me a non jewish european feel forever guilty about the treatment of the jewish people i don't know why this is not number one in the imdb rankings perhaps they are showing their bias against documentaries spoiler we win
<START> my favorite movie what a great story this really was i'd just like to be able to buy a copy of it but this does not seem possible
<START> some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skill with this series particularly the writing ok the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are creating just stink i'm a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage nothing new or genuinely interesting few of them are visually creative it's just typical fabricated hollywood crap uninteresting childish poorly conceived and in some cases flat out laughable much like tales from the crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity other then that this series blows hard i get the impression sometimes that they hired a bunch of eighth graders to write the episodes maybe they did
<START> normally i am a pretty generous critic but in the case of this film i have to say it was incredibly bad i am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be br br there were some gorgeous shots but it's too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie it might have worked if daggers was purely an action flick and not a romance but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle there is no chemistry between either of the couples whatever exists between mei and her men seems to be more lust than love and for the most part the dialogue is just silly this may be just a problem with translation but the frequent usage of the word flirt in particular reminded me of 8th grade not head over heels together forever worth dying for love i also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor the audience is given very little about the characters to really care about and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole i was wishing for a remote control to fast forward i was slumped in my seat ready to snore but mostly i just cringed a lot br br spoiler br br now the icing on the cake or rather adding insult to injury the ending was truly one of the most horrible laughable ones i have ever seen the boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other oh and then it starts to snow randomly oh and then mei dagger embedded in heart suddenly pops up out of the weeds then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it's destination even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet wow cool br br well then mei dies finally i guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death jin sings sobs holds her body close screen goes blank i and the people surrounding me are chuckling not a good sign br br visually stunning but ultimately a failure
<START> the plot sounds vaguely interesting a scientist bateman discovers how to transplant animal eyes and optic nerves into other animals like humans a young man monteith is blinded saving a coworker at work the scientist gets a call from a doctor that the young man is a good candidate to be the first human recipient the recipient starts becoming more and wolf like but the effect is nothing more than weird eyes and running at night with dogs for the whole movie the budget is too low the dialogue too stilted i laughed out loud at some of the ridiculous talk and the acting too inept long portions of the movie are nothing more than dreamy looks eerie music and interspersed clips of wolves in the wild way too long even at 90 minutes boring and devoid of ideas br br the military want to use the eye transplants to give wounded soldiers back their eyesight and presumably want to militarize the technology there's a silly subplot about a beautiful indian girl korey who thinks she can help using indian wisdom about the wolves they make love while music heavy on drums and indian chanting is heard crazy man the love making takes place immediately after a gruesome murder who edited this turkey a grouchy medicine man who spouts platitudes seems to do little except for adding atmosphere br br here's two ridiculous scenes a worker at the research lab goes into the animal room to discover the monkeys have been let out of their cages she gets scared looks left at the monkeys turns right turns left turns right turns left this goes on for a while who edited this run out of the damn lab it was so stupid i started laughing another ridiculous scene our hero is at home escapes out a window as the heavily armed military arrive he leaves the window open the military guys go to the open window look out the window they say looks like he was here and leave he went out the open window guys crazy br br near the end of the movie military guys are firing machine guns over and over at trees when obviously nothing is there easier to place the squibs i guess they have 6 machine guns which have cut down trees but decide to fight our hero with 1 knife shoot the guy who wrote this trash there's a pointless confrontation at the end and believe me i'm not spoiling anything for you there's not enough plot to spoil br br i figure the whole thing was a tax write off or a rush job to make use of unused budget money left over from some better movie
