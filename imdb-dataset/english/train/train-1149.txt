<START> pretty good film from preminger labyrinthine at times as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live in this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying as its hero a good cop with a bad temper gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head br br dana andrews plays the lead as if it were hamlet and has never been better the story may be pure melodrama but andrews gives it weight and almost raises it to the level of tragedy as his girl gene tierney is attractive but unremarkable gary merrill makes for a very interesting villain with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to andrews' coolness his smiling amiable seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him br br there are no major surprises in this film which seems transitional for all concerned for director preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his laura stars andrews and tierney who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made the supporting cast merrill karl malden neville brand are understandably more optimistic as they were all on their way up preminger as serene an observer as ever lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain much less resolve br br
<START> fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately blood surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid redundant pulp horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal 'crocodile' directed by a disappointing tobe hooper and 'lake placid' blood surf is every bit as bad as these other films and Â on top of that Â it likes to exaggerate tremendously the saltwater crocodile supposedly is 90 years old over 30 ft long and it kills for fun during the film he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer dudes dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark congested area the only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location even though it's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this the lagoons and nature looks marvelous every other aspect is simply disastrous there's a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable the dialogues are downright painful to listen to you won't believe some of the lines these actors have to say i know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but i hope for their own sake they're not that stupid early in the film one of the characters refers to jaws as being a 'mechanical toy' but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than spielberg's great white shark the visual effects in 'blood surf' are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress i won't say too much about the acting since it's secondary in flicks like this the girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast you guessed right blood surf is a very bad film so bad it becomes fun again but 'funny' for a whole other reason than james hickox intended
<START> several young iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain when they're caught they're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot but out of sight the prisoners plead to be let go but rules are rules br br given the pedigree of its director jafar panahi it was disarming to discover that offside is a comedy and a frequently hilarious one in 1997's the mirror panahi presents two versions of iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is real in 2000's the circle several iranian women step outside the system their transgressions are different but they all end up in the same tragic place br br however thinking now about offside it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous as the women demand to know why they can't watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to answer the only possible outcome is comedy br br what makes offside most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system they are simply soccer fans and patriots and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nation's grasp
<START> elia kazan one of the best theater directors this country ever had showed he was equally at home with movies with panic in the streets mr kazan gives us an early version of what would come later with perhaps his master piece on the waterfront although both movies share only the water setting for they are different visions about different subjects br br mr kazan shot on location in new orleans the adaptation by daniel fuchs of the edna and edward anhalt stories that are the basis of the film is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting the big easy one of the big assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by joseph macdonald that shows new orleans at its best also the music by alfred newman and the song by billie holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch br br this film could have been shot in new york or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like broklynese than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country br br one thing comes clear in the movie jack palance making his screen debut smolders the screen every time one sees him he was so intense at the same time this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner who unknown to him is stricken with a fatal disease blackie comforts this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying man's greasy hair with abandon notable also was the fact that mr palance and mr mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts something so refreshing because both actors make it seem real br br the film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the reed family at the beginning of the film we see a family man painting furniture with his young son later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can't make ends meet with his salary something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis richard widmark playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people barbara bel geddes as the wife sounds as though she's a suburban woman from connecticut br br the film is enjoyable thanks to mr kazan's direction and the excellent cast working in the movie
<START> the story of a drifter his sheep ranch boss and the boss's daughter is not for all tastes but it's still very intriguing it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand amongst the scenery we've come to know so well through other films from this region br br this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan and i've been a fan of hers ever since the cast also contains bruno lawrence who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film smash palace terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter regan br br sharply acted with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america but believe you me the unexpurgated version is not to be missed
<START> i loved the idea of this film from the moment i first saw a trailer for it einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly playful slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film the added spice of matthau as einstein made it even better br br the story is pure fantasy but a delightful one an auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman who happens to be einstein's niece with the help of four fairy godfathers of physics ed embarks on a quest to win catherine's heart throw a jealous fiancÃ© who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology and eisenhower into the mix and you have pure fun br br the film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances walter matthau play einstein as a mischievous imp cupid with a slide rule tim robbins is wonderfully endearing as ed and meg ryan plays a step above her normal rom com level stephen fry is a joy as the rrratman and ryan's fiancÃ© who lacks a single romantic bone in his body br br the film fell below most radars but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings it features first rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world
<START> this film is really vile it plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s 80s and puts it into a school context i'm not saying that urban crime wasn't a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren't aren't problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it's not a case of social issues but a white upper middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol and of course he knows how to play the system does that sound familiar yes this turd is pure violent exploitation a really nasty piece of work it's disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment this belongs in the same category as trash like exterminator death wish 2 5 and so on and so on the only remarkable thing is that michael fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this
<START> rob schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements facials and performances of not humans this time he is the animal marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked so marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man but on his way to the crime scene he crashes with his car and gets really damaged he doesn't remember what happens and at the next ordinary day his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts of course we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings are useless she is played by collen haskell there are no negative characters the negative character is destiny if i could use this metaphor marvin should find out how to become a normal human being again by the way his animal instincts helps him in some situations schneider's performance is a so so the movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies called mindless fun as i have written above so watch it for the monkey style rob schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that schneider appears in he is a great comedian but this is not his best movie
<START> i didn't feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless br br it is original although reminded me a little of two other french films vidocq and city of lost children mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters br br set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster br br always interesting with the perennial 'black arts' well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable br br scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing
<START> the majority of stephen king's short stories are little gems with original ideas that don't take a long time to develop basically lean and mean he sets them up quickly in a scarce number of pages you read 'em and you're finished before you know you've begun they're like the equivalent of a carton of mcdonald's fries they taste really good and you know there's not much nutritional value in them re from a literary standpoint they don't say much about the universal human condition but you're still gonna scarf 'em down just don't be a pig and go for the extra super sized portion and fill up on too much grease too much grease is a metaphor for the prose in king's novels when find yourself reading one of them and saying come on enough with the pop cultural observations or clever yankee asides get on with the story already he has compiled four books of short story collections i've read them all from nightshift to the latest everything's eventual and they all display an efficiency of getting to the point which is sometimes sorely lacking in his tome sized novels br br but his short stories never overstay their welcome which brings us to the tv adaptations of nightmares and dreamscapes br br how in the hell did they the series' producers get a green light to turn stories that usually averaged 15 pages into 50 minute episodes i'll tell you how two words stephen king stories with his name on them probably didn't come cheap and one hour shows enable more advertising than half hour ones so what should have been an anthology of mostly 23 or 24 minute episodes is turned into double that length and double the commercial time ka ching br br i'm not going to waste time synopsizing the plots of these stories this review supposes you have already read the stories and or seen the show what follows is merely my gut reactions to what tnt presented of the four installments so far here's my ten cent assessment from first to worst br br battleground not a classic by any means but hey how could anyone argue with keeping william hurt from opening his trap by filming this episode without a single line of dialog and the tongue in cheek reference and destruction of the killer zuni doll from trilogy of terror proved to me the producers and the writer of the teleplay who is richard matheson's son the writer of tot knew their mission with this one was to make the action deadly yet at the same time fun it took longer to get to hurt's apartment than it should have but i think it fulfilled it's objective 8 10 br br umney's last case liked this one primarily because of william h macy's performance i think the writer umney should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eye umney beginning because he was the actual reality of the story and anyone familiar with the king short story probably half if not more of the audience knew the chandleresque set up was due to get interrupted by the writer's reality so let's get on with it already and cut out the cute and clever hard boiled repartee' private dick banter already once the writer umney's family tragedy began to reveal though i thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer me at least feel sympathy for the real life macy's attempt to escape his sorrows by usurping his fictional creation's exciting life 6 10 br br the end of the whole mess uh this title is how i felt about this episode when it was over after twenty minutes i was ready to scream at the tv ok we get it already the younger brother is a mega mensa genius prodigy extraordinaire we know from ron livingston talking to the camera time is running out for me not fast enough i thought that the young whiz kid is going to discover something really bad for humanity we know this because he's already built an airplane but almost died because he couldn't steer it out of the path of a tree and he blew up his chemistry lab while teaching himself chemistry to think the end of the world could have been prevented if only this kid had some more parental supervision so much time was wasted on establishing the uber genius of henry thomas when we finally get to the resolution of his discovery the end of the world through unintended idiocy how much do we get to see of the world ending a cheap video shot of a reporter starting to forget what she's reporting on and brief radio broadcasts announcing the day of judgement is at hand oh and the brother's parents drooling and singing old songs my point is if your story is really about the end of the whole mess world i wanna see the mess as it goes up in flames and crashes and burns talk about ending with a whimper indeed 2 10 br br crouch end this episode just ticked me off totally i could have lived with the taking forever exposition of the happy couple arriving at their hotel playing slap and tickle having lunch and getting a taxi that was half the episode right there if once they finally crossed over into crouch end the episode delivered the chills but it failed miserabley not only wasn't it scary it was practically laughable ooh look a kitty wait it turns oh my god look at it's scary eye uh huh they could have gone a long way towards filming the crouch end sequence at night instead of in daylight too things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows but i guess the budget wasn't high enough to shoot at night on the fake london sets they slapped together for this one on the page this is a very scary story about tourists wandering into places they shouldn't and the terrible things that might lurk just around a corner there the only terror in this adaptation was the directing and acting those were truly horrifying 1 10 br br overall series average so far 4 10
<START> comparison with american graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic speaking of timeliness there was an episode of cheers where norm and cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a movie they would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong there were sly reference such as 'they paved paradise to put up a parking lot' the filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan br br the characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie very little of what the characters said were believable combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail although there were two exceptions kelli williams liven things up as the future flower child and despite what another reviewer said rick shroeder was quite good showing that brooding characteristic that would come to full boil in his eventual appearance in n y p d blues
<START> if the crew behind zombie chronicles ever read this here's some advice guys br br 1 in a twist ending type movie it's not a good idea to insert close ups of every death in the movie in the opening credits that tends to spoil the twists y'know br br 2 i know you produced this on a shoestring and to be fair you worked miracles with your budget but please hire people who can actually act or at least walk talk and gesture at the same time joe haggerty i'm looking at you br br 3 if you're going to set a part of your movie in the past only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time br br 4 twist endings are supposed to be a surprise sure we don't want twists that make no sense but signposting the reveal as soon as you introduce a character that's not a great idea br br kudos to the guys for trying but in all honesty i'd rather they hadn't br br only for zombie completists
<START> alicianne laurel barnett becomes a live in babysitter for young rosalie nordon rosalione cole who has recently lost her mother but rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and continuously visits her grave conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house late at night where she also meets her friends br br this starts off good with a truly eerie sequence in the cemetery then falls apart the story is thin and there is tons of padding to make the film 85 minutes long the acting is terrible across the board with cole easily being the worst badly directed with some of the worst editing i've ever seen in a motion picture scenes and sound are just cut off with no rhyme or reason also the film has terrible and obvious post production sound br br as for blood and violence forget it there's very little and what there is looks incredibly fake i've never seen such fake looking blood looks like ketchup boring pointless a rightfully forgotten drive in movie you can skip this one
<START> i moved out here to get away from this kind of thing the small town sheriff laments br br this happens a lot in chicago his deputy asks br br well no not really the plot is that a group of martians mistake a halloween rebroadcast of orson welles' war of the worlds as an account of a real martian invasion and conclude they need to get in on the action what follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the martian's haphazard attempts to conquer the town of big bean il everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes except for the sheriff's daughter and her friend a kid in a duck suit br br the martians themselves are comical and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on it's a fun family movie
<START> before sunrise has many remarkable things going on almost too many to fit into one review like this but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties maybe even in all of contemporary cinema to be observant not about love per say so much as it's about a human connection how does one fall in love at first sight no one does at least that's deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film and yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna and on the way there start to talking about things at first arbitrary then personal jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town' in vienna until his plane the next morning br br before sunrise gives jessie and celine in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance and in a sense is about the act of having conversations of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another here it's often about relationships and commitments as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential or seemingly so and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities we hear confessions of desires for other loves or what weren't really loves of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul i loved the bit about the quakers in the church and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism jessie may be more responsible for that last part but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives br br meanwhile it's always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s generation x mode but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other where sweet asides are actually acceptable i have to tell you a secret jessie says and then leans in for a kiss ho ho or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way i loved the scene with the poet where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share but really are seeing them do it first hand all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives as it may lead off into the future br br featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness however self contained as it may lead into something more who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone if only for less than 24 hours and be that much more attached than a married couple this is perhaps linklater's thesis but there's more to it than just that it's a very dense film and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly one scene especially which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other's friend a
<START> here's an oddity a modern day film about a serial killer that has no fight scenes nobody seen dying no car chases and no loud noises and it takes place in russia there are only two short action scenes but they are horrific br br the rest of the story is detective work and how much red tape the poor detective had to go through to solve the murders this is a very somber movie and somber best describes the personality of the hero stephen rea as well yet the story is not depressing and it's very interesting all the way through br br rea is outstanding as the determined harried looked detective jeffrey demunn is downright scary as the killer donald sutherland's russian accent is suspect but he plays the only character in this film that has some warmth br br once again the story is dotted with liberal agendas here and there with not one but two references to bias against gays the total validity of secular psychology police and government officials being boorish crude bigoted yadda yadda yadda br br otherwise it's an intelligent and refreshingly low key crime film this is a somewhat unique film that probably is not well known but is well liked by the people who have seen it since it's based on a true life account of this killer it's all the more chilling don't pass this by just because you haven't anything about it
<START> even without speaking a word billy connely is wonderful as a zombie carrie ann moss as mom even better zombie girlfriends br br my father thied to eat me i never tried to eat timmy br br and i thought dawn of the dead was good it's kinda like airplane meets meats night of the living dead sponsored by zomcom br br and don't forget my head coffin br br and fido in an aloha shirt is just way cool br br and yes the social comment is just too much to even begin to comment on br br sufice it to say it all really works
<START> a noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped the first was marlee matlin's award for children of a lesser god in 1986 and the next ten years were to see another best actress award holly hunter for the piano in 1994 and no fewer than five best actor awards dustin hoffman in 1988 for rain man daniel day lewis in 1989 for my left foot al pacino in 1992 for scent of a woman tom hanks in 1994 for forrest gump and geoffrey rush in 1996 for shine for portrayals of the disabled matlin who played a deaf woman is herself deaf but all the others are able bodied br br this phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting when jodie foster failed to win best actress for nell in 1994 some people saw this as evidence of a backlash against this sort of portrayal my view however is that the majority of these awards were well deserved i thought the 1992 award should have gone to either clint eastwood or robert downey rather than pacino but apart from that the only one with which i disagreed would have been hanks' and that was because i preferred nigel hawthorne's performance in the madness of king george in that film of course hawthorne played a character who was mentally ill br br my left foot was based upon the autobiography of the irish writer and painter christy brown brown was born in 1931 one of the thirteen children of a working class dublin family he was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well he was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body his left foot hence the title he learned to write and draw by holding a piece of chalk between his toes and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet br br life in working class dublin in the thirties and forties could be hard and the city jim sheridan himself a dubliner shows us here is in many ways a grim grey cheerless place very different from our normal idea of the emerald isle sheridan and day lewis were later to collaborate on another film with an irish theme in the name of the father against this however must be set the cheerfulness and spirit of its people especially the brown family much of christy's success was due to the support he received from his parents who refused to allow him to be institutionalised and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior and from his siblings we see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a specially made cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build christy a room of his own in their back yard br br the film could easily have slid into sentimentality and ended up as just another heart warming triumph over adversity movie that it does not is due to a number of factors principally the magnificent acting in the course of his career day lewis has given a number of fine performances but this together with the recent there will be blood is his best he is never less than 100 convincing as christie his tortured jerky movements and strained attempts at speech persuade us that we really are watching a disabled person even though intellectually we are well aware that day lewis is able bodied the other performances which stand out are from fiona shaw as his mentor dr eileen cole from hugh o'conor as the young christy and from brenda fricker as christy's mother which won her the best supporting actress award br br the other reason why the film escapes sentimentality is that it does not try to sentimentalise its main character christy brown had a difficult life but he could also be difficult to live with and the film gives us a warts and all portrait he was a heavy drinker given to foul language and prone to outbursts of rage he could also be selfish and manipulative of those around him and the film shows us all these aspects of his character of course it also shows us the positive aspects his courage his determination and his wicked sense of humour day lewis's acting is not just physically convincing in that it persuades us to believe in his character's disability but also emotionally and intellectually convincing in that it brings out all these different facets of christy's character his oscar was won in the teeth of some very strong opposition from the likes of robin williams and kenneth branagh but it was well deserved 8 10
<START> i think cliff robertson certainly was one of our finest actors he has a half dozen classics to his credit he does fine here as the heavy but the direction is so bad and the pacing so tiresome it never gets off the mark the story starts off well although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging herself still he mugs well and carries things along the death knell is twofold first of all if we were to take the amount of time characters spend walking from one room to another or one part of the house to another it would eat up about a third of the movie add to that robertson's character sitting up in bed in the blue light looking confused that might add another chunk i agree with those that said a half hour shorter would have made it a pretty decent though insignificant film the biggest weakness is just a convoluted plot that when all is said and done leaves incredible questions i'm not putting in spoilers but when it ends don't think too much i can come up with ten what ifs without raising a sweat it would have been better if it had remained a ghost story
<START> ok so this is coming a few weeks late but it is here mostly this is because of statements of various negative natures starting with the technology when star trek tos ran special effect technology was extreamely low tec and more than that the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups in the 35 years seince tos premiered the crew of star trek have become experts at economy br br ultimately they have decided quite rightly in my mind to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii as for the nits being picked about first contact with the klingon empire it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingon's in 2200 nothing was firmly established br br enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we've seen in a while this is what voyager could have been no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies but be thankful that star trek has so few so quit gripping and enjoy
