<START> broad enough for you wait till you see this heavy handed br br adaption of a little collegiate one act what is shocking and wild in br br college rarely holds up over time and this is proof to take on the br br catholic church with broadside humor just isn't shocking or br br interesting or funny it's kind of boring the performers are all br br game giving all they've got but it's basically a play that doesn't br br open up to film well not a lot of fun
<START> hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straight forward drama without much to recommend it hitchcock's talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point of view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers' desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual storyteller
<START> why do movie makers always go against the author's work i mean yes things have to be condensed for the sake of viewer interest but look at anne of green gables they did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful i can't believe that they chose to combine three novels together for anne of avonlea into such a dreadful mess look at all they missed out on by doing that paul irving little elizabeth the widows windy poplars and anne's college years for heaven's sake wouldn't it have been delightful to meet priscilla and all the rest of the redmond gang kevin sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events the way he did this movie was good if you leave the novels out of it but l m montgomery's beautiful work is something that should not be denied this movie was a let down after seeing the successful way he brough anne of green gables to life
<START> i remember this show as it became a regular viewing on a saturday evening br br sabrina is a young girl who moves in with her aunts who as it turns out are witches and she is one to so sabrina must learn how to control hr powers and use them effectively she also must deal with school a vicious rival named libby her ditsy best friend and boyfriend harvey kinkle br br the show was funny and entertaining it kept saturday evenings entertaining for a 10 year old boy and made him laugh out loud and flirt with 'libby'
<START> this film's basic premise is a political cartoon i suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a feel good film on gender equality indeed a recent commentator stated it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do what claptrap no one man or woman can do anything they want to do and unfortunately demi moore buffing up for seal hell week in the early 27 week bud s program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a seal is simply not going to make it so there is approximately an 80 dropout rate in what is arguably the roughest military training program those are the ones who voluntarily drop out can't compete on a physical level suffer frequent physical injury during the training or can't handle the psychological harassment i never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived purported message of this film in the real world demi wouldn't last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training wishing alone won't do it skip this film as wishful thinking and better spend your time reading the warrior elite by dick couch crown new york 2001 for the best description as to what really goes on in this training ring the bell demi br br
<START> a favourite of mine this movie tells of two feuding new york characters steve brodie raft and chuck connors beery who both strive to be the main guy in the bowery in the late nineteenth century br br brodie 1863 1901 and connors 1852 1913 were real people though this is a heavily fictionalized account of their antics based on a play brodie's legendary did he do it it's still a cause of argument jump from the brooklyn bridge 1886 for which he became famous is shown here as happening around the same time as the spanish american war 1898 director walsh clearly had a great affection for the period so beautifully recreated here and it includes a wild rumbustious ragtime number from saloon singer trixie odbray a young pert kelton raft is at his slickest as brodie and beery shows again what a clever actor he was as tough big hearted and at times quite touching connors pretty fay wray is the love interest both the boys are pursuing br br full of life and energy the bowery moves at a fast pace unlike many early talkies it is not an easy movie to find but is well worth looking out for
<START> i quote oedpius rex because it is a tragedy that this film was even made br br this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i am in no way an uwe boll hater like most of the humourless people on imdb br br uwe boll movies like postal and tunnel rats are hilariously bad and therefore entertaining but honestly this movie was just horrible i hated it so much that i'd give it a zero star rating if i could the story is just crap it spends four fifths of the film building the plot and then they have the middle which is just scenes of grizzly horrible tastelessly done murder the finally end it with a villan wins ending which is totally acceptable but surely it could have been more tasteful than this br br i am not against uwe boll like i said earlier nor am i against violent movies i f king love violent movies i loved the saw movies the hostel movies tokyo gore police the new york ripper the 28 movies dog soldiers my bloody valentine last house on the left watchmen wolf creek every tarantino movie every sam peckinpah even cannibal f king holocaust but this omfg br br this was just cruel sadistic and perverted and look at the movies i just listed if i liked cannibal holocaust and not this then it must be bad uwe don't go all dark again you're funny when you are light hearted just like ed wood this was just an awful experience i felt horrible all over after seeing this br br do not watch avoid at all cost
<START> david beckham is a british soccer star and the husband of victoria beckham posh spice of the spice girls his trademark is a goal shot that curves across the pitch and into the net the soccer equivalent of an unhittable curve ball in baseball bend it like beckham means making that type of spectacular shot apart from that and a little shrine to him in the main character's bedroom and a faux cameo at the very end the movie has nothing to do with him br br the movie is full of little soccer in jokes such as the present that one of the characters' parents give her of a jersey with the number 9 on it property of the great mia hamm to those in the know references to posh 'n' becks the video homage to the wusa one of the characters plays for a disbelieving friend they have that lesbian gags sports bra gags and so on br br the story is about a teenage girl in england who idolizes beckham and wants to be a soccer star she has a real gift but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles she must overcome are the absence of a professional women's league in the uk hence their fascination with our wusa and her parents who are indian immigrants set in very old fashioned ways that do not allow daughters among other things to engage in contact sports the girl's family are portrayed as figures of ironic fun but with great affection think my big fat greek wedding the girl loves and respects them enough to go through sitcom hell to conceal her growing soccer stardom from them
<START> the haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house good effects work and sound work a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house there are scenes that make you jump and the sinister aspects of what went on at hill house in the past i found interesting there are genuinely creepy moments in the film and i liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets curtains and the house itself jerry goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you what i wish could've happened is for something a little more intense jan de bont had a pg 13 rating to contend with and i think that he held back a little too much poltergeist scared me silly when i saw it many years ago and it still holds up the haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror the ending was for me a little anticlimactic overall i enjoyed it the acting is good and there are moments that make you jump i just wish it scared me more
<START> from the director of movies 'last seduction' and 'kill me again' comes another movie in the noir style john dahl created a niche for himself by making movies on the themes of adultery blackmailing in the early 90s though i did not have much of an opinion in regards to last seduction but nowadays mr dahl has resorted to directing television shows its a shame since the man had talent br br spoilers this is quite an impressive movie which revolves around a drifter cage that comes in to the town of wyoming for a job however he does not prove lucky and becomes mistaken for a hit man from texas by bar owner j t walsh he is given the task to kill his wife boyle but cage decides to split after taking the upfront payment without doing it on the way out of town he accidentally hits a guy on the road who he then takes back to the local hospital at that point cage coincidently meets walsh again who also appears to be the local sheriff after that cage escapes from his clutches but meets in to the real hit man that happens to be dennis hopper br br john dahl has co written and directed this movie therefore it goes to show that a project can turn out decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen the direction is of good standard however while watching the movie i got a made for tv movie feeling there were too many close up frames however this does not deter the movie from being an enjoyable experience the movie had good pace and the structure was perfect dahl written the script with good duration of lenght br br cage portrayed the role as a drifter realistically though to me his performance seemed somewhat restrained his facial expressions were on the mark lara flynn boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale her hairstyle was far out and can make any guy go on his knees hopper played his part well but i feel he was miscast for this role he did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit man the role was not written keeping his personality in mind br br while viewing one will get deja vu of previous movies like 'the hot spot' and 'a perfect murder' due to the fact that some sub plots are similar overall if you are a fan of noir movies then this one is for you worth recommending 7 10
<START> this film has the kernel of a really good story the work of the men and women of the coast guard especially in the north pacific is the stuff of heroes and legends this film mucks up a good story with three endings none satisfying a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged romantic relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire the rescue scenes are great even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal but the backstory is lame and disappointing costner is good especially his hand acting watch for it ashton kutcher is flat but not terrible the main female characters are one dimensional the best female is one of the coast guard sailors in the rescue center and she's on camera for about two minutes in the whole film it could have been an excellent film and costner needs one
<START> the film of artemisia may be considered treason or as true artistic license br br which might one aver br br in documented history artemisia gentileschi was subjected to the thumbscrew and still affirmed that she was r ed as mary garrard and gloria steinem have eloquently affirmed br br in the movie under a different torture she refused to condemn her lover violator br br how may a movie deviate so much from received history yet still inform the human heart br br the answer is not so hard to find in the movie the director and cast had filled a gaping hole in the historical record with the power of imagination br br that led to a conclusion that differs from the record br br so be it i find both the record and the movie to be compelling br br in both the movie and it seems in history artemisia was a painter before all else br br for that vision framed in ravishing sic film composition i am truly grateful br br seldom have i seen a movie that so compelled my eyes br br david broadhurst
<START> romantic comedies can really go either way you know you'll see one that's really sappy and you'll think you want something more realistic then you'll see one that's realistic but it might be too dull to keep you interested or maybe you'll see one that does everything right but just fails to make you smile romantic comedies are tough movies you go into them with a lot of expectations and usually whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the filmmakes was anticipating your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you br br of course if you've got a girl next to you and you're a guy like me it probably doesn't matter all that much whether the movie's any good you've got other things on your mind for you i say go get her tiger for the rest of us i say see a guy thing it's a lot of fun br br because a guy thing knows you're going in to this movie with expectations so it doesn't pretend that its guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams and it's not his wife plot is going to make everyone happy sure maybe you like it but maybe it doesn't ring true or you think it's cruel a guy thing covers that what a guy thing does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast i've seen in a long time so if you don't the main plotline you've still got something to make you smile br br whether we're talking about the seasoned veterans of big and small screen like larry miller pretty woman best in show james brolin traffic julie hagerty airplane david koechner saturday night live and conan o'brien regular dirty work austin powers ii or thomas lennon the state and viva variety or new faces like shawn hatosy the faculty or colin foo saving silverman we're talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film's inspired characterisation steal the show time after time and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days br br and that's not to detract from the actual romantic throughline and the stars that carry it along because it's very sweet and terribly well done jason lee mallrats chasing amy dogma etc is touching as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control and selma blair shows an understated brilliance in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually is br br a lot of the success of the movie though falls on julia stiles the right girl in the right place at the wrong time and she wears it well not since gosh i don't know when have i seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy of course it's all in the closeups the voice and the subtle smiles but it's magical and it's one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place br br but julie stiles's slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead on in their classic simplicity this is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable stock types makes them fall over each other to make you laugh and then comes through with a great deal of heart br br a guy thing is a movie you've definitely seen before and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they set down to make it we haven't really seen any new romantic comedies since shakespeare the relative success of this one or that one is entirely dependent upon the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl a guy thing does embrace that with a bit of a metacinematic edge often taking the scenes into the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to acknowledge the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices at play br br for the record it also even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional structural notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy so even the feminists out there might get a kick out of it br br and guys i think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as jason lee's friends in this movie i'm not going to spoil it for you but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest dudes in cinema i suggest you just say it's a guy thing and leave it at that
<START> kaabee depicts the hardship of a woman in pre and during wwii raising her kids alone after her husband imprisoned for thought crime this movie was directed by yamada youji and as expected the atmosphere of this movie is really wonderful although the historical correctness of some scenes most notably the beach scene is a suspect br br the acting in this movie is absolutely incredible i am baffled at how they managed to gather this all star cast for a 2008 film yoshinaga sayuri possibly the most decorated still active actress in japan will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film shoufukutei tsurube in a supporting role was really nice as well it was asano tadanobu though who delivered the most impressive performance perfectly portraying the wittiness of his character and the difficult situation he was in br br films with pre war setting is not my thing but thanks to wonderful directing and acting i was totally absorbed by the story also it wasn't a far left nonsense like yuunagi no machi sakura no kuni and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred in that period in japan excellent film highly recommended for all viewers
<START> i can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful but the script or lack thereof makes for a film that's also pointless on the plus side the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in dorothy s fans should stick to galaxina peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter b's amazingly awful book killing of the unicorn

<START> i'm sorry but this is such a bad movie it's hilarious football hooligans arguing in a travel lodge suits shades alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he made this it is as far from the truth as you can get br br the casting was atrocious gary oldman as a football hooligan he doesn't look scary act scary or even come across as someone who would like football and as for yeti what the hell suits shades and sitting in a travelodge childishly taunting each other with its about time you got your nappy on please br br and the yeti's gang spraying the icc's underwear br br i don't see how anyone can even take this film seriously br br 4 10 its possibly the most inaccurate portrayal of the crisis of the late eighties hooliganism i have ever seen
<START> good films cannot solely be based on a beautiful garden and a hill top surprised to see it has won two awards extremely overrated i first saw that kind of films from china visually stunning but also with really something captivating to say well more than 10 years ago and i'm sure there are still more coming up this is not one of them i'm afraid
<START> this is one of the worst movies ever made trite predictable flat br br the only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting barcelona i imagine they would use films like this in guantanamo or some other hidden cia nsa prison to torture suspects br br often bad movies have some redeeming features this has nothing if i was in it or worked on it i would change my name truly a turd hard to write more than this but i feel the world's film watchers needed a head's up on this on the other hand it will make a great gift for people you can't stand br br you could send it to politicians you dislike in laws ex wives teachers you hated former employees dick cheney w and a host of others
<START> i've been intrigued by this film for a while in part because of the extremely high score here on imdb a 9 0 average with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of any accessible silent film how had i not heard of this film before this website well you can't always trust the ratings this is actually a very good film preserved quite well if the fine vhs transfer i rented is any indication excellent acting by the principals especially william haines as brown and good location work at cambridge with some fine action footage in the climactic harvard yale football game but the story must have seemed a hoary chestnut even in 1926 obnoxious self centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place becoming in the process a caring self sacrificing friend i doubt people in 1926 found much that was really exciting in the last few reels the predictability factor is high still it starts out very well and is certainly deserving of being remembered if not praised to the heavens maybe the previous 350 voters are mostly harvard men br br edit now 600 voters and the score has actually climbed to 9 2 seriously folks there is ballot stuffing going on here i defy anybody to explain why this is a better film than metropolis or the general
