<START> this movie sucks ass something about a heatwave in some european country complete trash there's nothing going for this movie whatsoever maybe 30 seconds of sex but that's it there is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off this movie is complete rash and you shouldn't subject yourself to watching it i regret it it's very boring i would rate it zero but i can't no body in their right mind should see this i'm sure you'll regret it completely i did how could they think up something this bad even mystery men was better mystery men that sucks that movie wasn't worth being made complete waste of time the characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored
<START> 'baptists at our barbecue' is the best film ever made now that i got your attention with that horribly inaccurate statement that should be a hanging offense if spoken let me begin my short overview of this tacky offensive pretentious and boring hunk of junk i guess you could consider a movie first of all the low budget of this stinker is totally obvious based on the very poor and inexperienced direction of christian vuissa and the tacky overly preachy whiny and stilted screenplay by f mathew smith i really despise the fact that it sends a very pro mormon and sort of anti every other religion message yes the story is about a small town half full with mormons and half full with baptists it shows all the main and role model characters being mormon and being so nice and perfect yet they are being picked on by the evil conniving and very judgmental baptists it shows how beautiful mormons are and how cold hearted and ignorant baptists are instead of showing a little solidarity like would be appropriate and realistic i'm a part of neither religion i'm actually an atheist but this offended me along with another countless amount of baptists most likely it shows the baptists as being very unopened and unwelcoming to the mormons and the mormons being very accepting when again in reality there is a mutual like dislike between them sorry i didn't mean to go off on a rant br br another aspect of 'baptists at our barbecue' i didn't much care for was the acting the performances are very amateurish and unnatural especially from the female lead heather beers miss beers stumbles her way through her part without any passion or feeling for her role and i wasn't too much impressed with dan merkley who's the main character in this lackluster of a motion picture but i have to say he's way more talented or shows more talent in this film then heather beers whoever played the town sheriff was awful also although there is maybe a tiny laugh deep within the film it is full of clichÃ©s for example the main character tartan merkley finds solace with a native american who always gives him the best advice on things relating to a tribal way of life how clichÃ© is that to make the situation even more of a pathetic clichÃ© tartan buys the poor lonely heathen a puppy dog ugghhh br br if you want my advice stay as far away from 'baptists at our barbecue' as you can i saw it on the shelf and thought it would be a cute and interesting little indie about religion all i got was a well piece of crap grade d br br my ratings guide a absolutley flawless a a masterpiece near perfect a excellent b great b very good b good c a mixed bag c average c disappointing d bad d very bad d absolutley horrendous f not one redeeming quality in this hunk of hollywood feces
<START> this film is based on the novel by john fante could someone please tell me why i see absolutely no reason why this fine book should be adapted in this way if you want to make a romantic melodramatic hollywood production with colin farell and selma hayek then how could you possibly make a connection to ask the dust the novel and if you wanted to make this story into a film then why would you want to make it into a romantic melodramatic hollywood production with colin farell and selma hayek i don't get it br br the adaptation of the story is poorly made and if you have read the book and liked it i'm almost sure you won't like what towne did with it br br in the beginning of the film you'll maybe find the casting odd the acting bad and the cinematography just a bit overdone but you hope for the best i really hoped a lot during this film i actually wanted it to be good but it only gets worse and it is as simple as that whether you read fantes novel or not this is not a good film just another romantic melodramatic hollywood production combined with bad acting lack of structure and of course plenty of shots of colin farells naked butt br br i could complain a lot more about this film but why waste my time i've seen it alright i had to see it because i like the book so much and was curious and i'm very disappointed br br 1 10 is for colin's sweet little mustache in the end of the film so sweet had he worn it the whole time through i'd given it 2 10
<START> richard attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with the academy award winning 'gandhi' back in '83 i didn't know of any other work of his till i recently came across 'cry freedom' released back in 1987 while it may not have been as popular as his gandhi it is every bit as gripping if not more and was released when south africa still had not got rid of the shackles of apartheid while most movies on social issues come out after the event had happened i guess this one released during the time br br the story is based on real life characters and events the book on which the movie was based was written by donald woods kevin kline a journalist who used to work in south africa until the end of the seventies it traces the origins of woods friendship with the charismatic black leader steve biko who is wonderfully portrayed by denzel washington i cannot imagine a better choice for the role washington exudes a natural charm and screen presence which biko's character required br br while initially woods was against what he felt was black racism being spread by biko after meeting the man he could not help being drawn into his struggles and ideas the bond between them grows stronger and woods and his family realise and become more sensitive to the plight of the people biko represents br br however finally tragedy strikes and woods must now concentrate on escaping from south africa with his book so that he can get it published and let the outside world know what is going on the second half of the movie is a gripping tale of his escape from south africa along with his family and will keep you on tenterhooks br br there are some deliciously humorous dialogues too the scene between biko and the lawyer in the courtroom is an example br br lawyer do you advocate violence biko i advocate a confrontation lawyer well isn't that violence mr biko biko not necessarily you and i are having a confrontation now but i don't see any violence br br however there are moments that bring you back to the horrors that pervaded the country before better sense prevailed the scene where the army opens fire on a protest by school children is gut wrenching and heartbreaking br br this is definitely a must watch i would suggest those not familiar with attenborough's work do take time out for this there are movies which make a lot of money and there are movies which make lives i would any day prefer the latter
<START> why watch this there is only one reason and that is for the greatness of john saxon i love his acting my most favorite appearances by him are in nightmare on elm street 1 3 and 7 as nancy's father a cop black christmas as a cop and from dusk till dawn again as a cop when i was rummaging through my local mall video outlet i came across the film zombie death house and i quickly tossed it back but before moving on i noticed that john saxon was not only an actor in this film but for the first time that i have ever heard of a director this intrigued me also the cheap 9 00 price tag and i and i had to have it upon coming home i realized that this film did not live up to saxon's other work even his acting which may have been muddled by the added pressures of directing but it was not just him the other actors sucked too it seemed as if they had all been pulled out of a recent porno shoot and told now guys you really have to act the film even looks of 80's porn quality i cannot in good faith recommend this film to casual viewers but if you are an obsessed fan of the 80's who missed out on the culture that came from that era by being born to late or a fan of crap films than this one is for also if you dig john saxon as i do
<START> the story and the show were good but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies ri'chard is great he really put on a top notch performance and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous seriously i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile i can't say anything bad about peter galleghar he's one of my favorite actors i love anne rice i'm currently reading the vampire chronicles but i'm glad i saw the movie before reading the book this is a little too real for me i prefer lestat and louis's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show sorry for the ambiguity but i don't want to give anything away sorry but it's just not my type of show
<START> gene hackman gets himself busted out of prison by a nameless government agency who want him for an assassination it's a given of course that hackman has the proficient skills for the job br br nobody tells him anything though he's given as the audience is given bits and pieces of information that's supposed to be suspenseful instead it's annoying and boring br br hackman goes through with the mission but the getaway is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders everybody dead to cover it up so everyone in the cast dies and at the end you don't really care br br one of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long almost three hours and got chopped down quite a bit maybe something really was lost in the translation but i tend to think it was a mercy act on the audience br br a very talented cast that had people like richard widmark candice bergen mickey rooney eli wallach and edward albert is so thoroughly wasted here it's a crime br br and we never do find out just what federal agency was doing all this the fbi the cia the dea or even the irs
<START> today i found they all laughed on vhs on sale in a rental it was a really old and very used vhs i had no information about this movie but i liked the references listed on its cover the names of peter bogdanovich audrey hepburn john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it i searched imdb and the user rating of 6 0 was an excellent reference i looked in mick martin marsha porter video dvd guide 2003 and Â wow Â four stars so i decided that i could not waste more time and immediately see it indeed i have just finished watching they all laughed and i found it a very boring overrated movie the characters are badly developed and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story the plot is supposed to be funny private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing but i have not laughed along the whole story the coincidences in a huge city like new york are ridiculous ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt antonio banderas or george clooney is quite ridiculous in the end the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie and whose life was showed in star 80 and death of a centerfold the dorothy stratten story the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen the future mrs keith richards the always wonderful even being fifty two years old audrey hepburn and the song amigo from roberto carlos although i do not like him roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as the king i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions manly dorothy stratten my vote is four br br title brazil muito riso e muita alegria many laughs and lots of happiness
<START> so steve irwin you have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs snakes lizards tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles and mud not only daily but with enthusiasm he was never able to make me want to do it but he managed to make his wife come close br br this movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category the films for people who just had their teeth drilled have a migraine or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity currently well populated by disney films it's too noisy well steve is too noisy he's just so happy all the time and would cut right through the blasÃ©' teenager i can hear it now that movie was so stupid or the tylenol with codeine i'd say his enthusiasm is catching but if it was i would own a room full of snakes and that hasn't happened yet i agreed they're beauties but i'm still not going to pet them br br plot was indeed predictable bad guys were so bad for a minute there i thought i was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore but the movie was filled with animals and steve and terri which is why i watched it that plot if you could call it that was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck my expectations were low and stayed that way br br i was hoping though that there would be a bit of a sequel where steve and terri having worked on their acting skills have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur i still can't believe we won't see steve anymore i hope that terri and the children continue to be involved in the australia zoo and the discovery channel at least i can't imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is crikey
<START> unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 except for the r rating there are very few things to like here one or two lines from kenan thompson david koechner we really should see him more and sam jackson are humorous and julianna margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings but sadly that's it poor plot poor acting worse writing and delivery the special effects are dismal as much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible if we consider the action portions well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan this movie only contains the latter kind this leaves little left i'm so glad i did not pay for this br br despite any hype i can read and think so as i sat down to watch i did not expect anything good i had no expectations but was somewhat worried going in yet like a train wreck one cannot merely look away and even with no expectations i was let down bad not even 'so bad it's good' material i'm very tolerant of bad movies but this makes six string samurai which i liked oscar worthy br br no this piece of over cgi'd rubbish is in the same company as battlefield earth little man and gigli how this is currently rated a 7 2 completely mystifies me brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that i can think of as answers br br i could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight i witnessed a train wreck i need to go wash my eyes 1 of 10
<START> though structured totally different from the book by tim krabbÃ© who wrote the original 'the vanishing' spoorloos it does have the same overall feel except for that koolhoven's style is less business like and more lyric the beginning is great the middle is fine but the sting is in the end a surprise emotional ending as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully never explicit but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour it is a shame american films can't be as open an honoust as this one where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject 'de grot' stays always within the boundaries of good taste 'de grot' tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years when you'll leave the cinema you'll be moved what can we ask more of a film anyway this film even gives more
<START> i could not believe how awful this film was i rarely watch commercial tv but thought well diane keaton is always worth watching i stand corrected everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame br br i realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age but the script to this was so inept clichÃ©d and baffling that i am surprised it ever got into development or that ms keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow's ear none of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable the acting looked like exercises in a beginning class i stared in open mouthed horror through most of this wondering what were they thinking very very sad that it has come to this don't waste your time
<START> this is absolutely one of the best movies i've ever seen it takes me on a a roller coaster of emotions i laugh and cry and get disgusted and happy and in love all this in a little over two hours of time br br the actors are all brilliant i have to mention the leading actor of course michael nyquist he does a remarkable job i also admire the actor who plays tore who plays this mentally challenged young man in such a convincing way he sort of reminded me of leonardo di caprios roll in gilbert grape and then there is the most beautiful song in the world gabriella's sÃ¥ng br br i recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy
<START> oh where to begin the cinematography was great when the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes i thought that i was in for a good movie then the cgi bigfoot showed up it looked like a cartoon drawing of the lion king and king kong's love child it totally took away from the believability of the character now i knew there wasn't a bigfoot chasing people hiking around the woods for no apparent reason but a cheesy cgi cartoon so from then on the whole movie was shot for me the money they flushed down the toilet for the cgi they could of spent on a costume like roger patterson did his was the best bigfoot costume ever no one else could match his i am a hardcore cheesy bigfoot movie fan and i was warned about this movie but my compulsion led me to watching this movie and i was disappointed like the previous reviews warned me about i know after you read this review you will still say i must watch sasquatch hunters must watch sasquatch hunters then you will say why did i waste my good hard earned money on such a excruciatingly bad boring movie
<START> a great film requiring an acquired taste if you're into action wham bam films and hate serious love stories then its not for you otherwise if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie now and again i recommend this very highly easily the best film produced in bollywood this century br br the only other indian film i would give 10 10 for is dil wale dulhaniya le jayenge even then it comes second to this masterpiece
<START> i'm sure this was one of those woah attractions in 1982 when epcot opened but now it's just silly the film's message is clichÃ© the circle vision is disorienting and that awful song at the end is grating and i really wish they'd install seats after so much walking all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes and when you hear there's a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous you get entertained while sitting down right wrong you're standing there for 18 minutes leaning against a short little railing disney should make a newer maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull lackluster film not fun skip it in fact skip canada altogether unless you're eating there move directly to the united kingdom
<START> many of the lead characters in hideo gosha's 1969 film hitokiri manslayer aka tenchu heaven's punishment were actual historical figures in western name order format ryoma sakamoto hampeita takechi shimbei tanaka izo okada anenokoji the name hitokiri a historical term refers to a group of four super swordsmen who carried out numerous assassinations of key figures in the ruling tokugawa shogunate in the mid 1800s under the orders of takechi the leader of the loyalist i e ultra nationalist pro emperor faction of the tosa clan what was this struggle about sad to say you won't find out in this film brilliant history lesson indeed br br no gosha is much more interested in showing you the usual bloody slicing and dicing and at absurd length the inner torment of the not very bright killer izo okada than in revealing actual history sakamoto for example was someone of historical significance considered to be the father of the imperial japanese navy the closest gosha comes to providing a history lesson is the scene in which sakamoto whom takechi considers a traitor to the loyalist cause comes to takechi's mansion to try to sway him ideologically he begins by talking about the international political situation with foreign warships in japan's ports and a japan that is too weak militarily to defend against them want to know more sorry gosha cuts off this potentially fascinating lecture in mid sentence so much for informing his audience about a turning point in japanese history br br the film left me in utter confusion about the aims of the two sides in this struggle for the two and a half centuries that the shogunate held central power in japan it was an institution dedicated to preventing social change to preserving the feudal relations of society it was fearful of outside contamination both ideological and technological in keeping with this spirit it outlawed firearms those instruments of leveling in europe and the americas with which a peasant could have stood up to a samurai throughout this period the emperor was nothing more than a spiritual figurehead br br but in the towns which stood in neutral zones between the feudal fiefdoms a new class of merchants landlords and craftsmen was developing the class known in europe by its french name the bourgeoisie inevitably as this new class gained strength it chafed against the many confines of feudal society as in europe the king emperor became the central figure in the bourgeoisie's struggle for power against the feudal aristocracy but a political leadership does not always fully understand the interests of the class it serves when the outside world arrived with a bang in 1853 in the form of u s admiral perry's black ships the ruling elite of japan was thrown into a crisis their military was no match for these foreigners also they had heard about the havoc the british and french imperialists were wreaking in china what should japan do to save itself from the fate of its weak neighbor surprisingly some elements within the usually isolationist shogunate were inclined to open trade with the foreigners in order to obtain some of their advanced technology this is the point of view represented just barely in the film by sakamoto on the other hand the emperor loyal ultra nationalists represented by takechi believed they could keep out the foreigners by force if only they could prevent the other faction from selling out the country sound familiar thus the assassination of key shogunate figures is in order and away we go br br takechi's motivations were for me the film's biggest puzzle gosha suggests that he is fighting mainly for his personal advancement rather than for the loyalist cause can we take this to represent the tenor of the loyalists as a whole do you care br br several reviewers have compared this film favorably with goyokin which gosha made in the same year but where goyokin is a crackling suspenseful adventure yarn with a hero worthy of sympathy hitokiri is plodding nowhere near as compelling and lacks such a hero sakamoto could have been this film's hero but we are not allowed to know him nor what he stands for well enough for him to achieve that status br br in view of his wonderful scores for five previous kurosawa films masaru sato's score here was very disappointing sounding like something rejected from a bonanza episode br br barry freed
<START> this movie is just funny mindless but funny to enjoy this movie completely you can't have a perception of how a film like this goes and just enjoy all the side jokes and puns which are involved with the film i still find the bit at the start funny when he says want a beer cock funny stuff but what makes the film decent is the fact that it doesn't try to hard to create a serious spin on the film too many comedies try to have serious aspects which you just don't believe but this is different and just focuses on being funny i must say though yasmin bleeth is terrible in the film and adds nothing but the 3 main guys coop remer and squeak are very funny to watch and make the film great to watch
<START> this movie lacked everything story acting surprise ingenuity and a soul fifteen minutes in i was staring at the screen saying how could all of these guys get together and consider themselves friends even without the girl another fifteen minutes in i was praying for as much amanda peet as possible when a bad movie quietly rears it's ugly head eye candy is a nice consolation but there wasn't much of that cheated on all fronts
<START> most reviews say that this is the weakest point in hamilton's short movie career this movie is a bit different from the rest and considering it the best or the worst depends on what you expect from a movie and what you expect from hamilton br br knowing hamilton as a photographer you can be slightly surprised while bilitis looks like his books in a movement with all those young girls discovering themselves and relations with each other on the edge of lesbian with a plot connecting these scenes laura concentrates on few characters what enables developing relations among them male female artist model but though we see beautiful photos many of them better than his average their number is reduced for the sake of the plot tendres cousines is different from both it is only hamilton's movie that looks more like a film than like a collection of moving photos because of that it can be acceptable to wider audience than hamilton's fans looking like an erotic comedy but not german soft core type schulmÃ¤dchen report fans would be very disappointed you won't laugh a lot but you can smile and that's something you don't often get from hamilton unlike all other hamilton's movies the age of female varies unlike other movies main character is a boy unlike his usual works this one isn't put out of place and out of time we have characters that live their life have their destiny and don't lead us only from one photo to another from one nude girl to another br br unfortunately hamilton again gets lost with a script in his hands girls on beaches under shower in low light rooms in gardens under tents in front of mirrors regardless of the amount of clothes this is his territory he can shoot minutes and hours and whatever he does you'll always feel the artist's eye and hand behind it but when he has to present us average everyday life he stops being hamilton and becomes average director who just follows the script hamilton is best known for his nudes but they are just a part of his work and in tendres cousines we have a reverse situation his girls are not in the best shots nature garden house remind us on hamilton's work often neglected part of it while girls even when nude don't have anything special in the way he presents us maybe hamilton was confused having a boy in front of camera maybe he was thinking about a line that censorship would accept maybe he was really trying to make something new and no one dared to tell him he shouldn't but he neglected what he was mostly praised for
