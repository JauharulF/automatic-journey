<START> this was just horrible the plot was just ok but the rest of the was was bad i mean come on puppet and then they even tried to make the movie digital and that made it even worse normally i would like low budget movie but this was just a waste of time and almost made me want to return the set that it came on i have about ten low budget movie set with like 6 8 movies on them and i would have to say this is the worse movie out of all of them also the wording is off and they use a fake plastic machetes that doesn't even look like a real one they could of used one that looked even a little close to a real one so save your time and money and don't watch this horrorible movie
<START> a friend lent me this dvd which he got from the director at a festival i think i went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great so maybe that colored my judgment but i have to admit that i liked this movie br br the standouts where the actors youssef kerkor was really good as ernie the main character kind of pathetic in a likable way adam jones who also directed and justin lane were excellent as the roommates who drive ernie mad the bill character justin lane who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda was by far my favorite he seemed the least one dimensional and reminded me of an old college roommate so much i called the guy after watching the dvd really kind of lovable and very funny some of the other acting was good some was so so but none of it was bad i also really liked the vigilante duo ridiculous and funny br br i'm giving this one high marks even though it has some issues because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared and decided to make their movie their way well done to adam jones and crew
<START> it appears even the director doesn't like this film but for me i think he's being a bit harsh on himself br br sure it's not perfect but there are some atmospheric shots and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout br br it's shot in what appears to be quite a pretty village which adds to the atmosphere as well br br if you like horror films shot in england give it a go br br i have just seen a trailer for this directors latest film 'the devil's chair' which looks quite amazing br br there aren't enough english horror films for me so any that come along deserve our attention and this one isn't as bad as you may think
<START> i've recently watched this movie in a lazy sunday afternoon with some friend of mine and we have a lot of fun this movie is a masterpiece of trash try to watch it with this purpose it hadn't been expected of course but the performance provided by the actors and alberto tomba is absolutely the best the weak script and the low cost budget had created an amazing mix of foolish things tomba was just retired from alpine ski racing where he was a dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and 1990s tomba won three olympic gold medals two world championships and nine world cup season titles seriously about the director nobody knows why damiano damiani he has signed this movie all the other damiani's directions are considerable
<START> whatever you become in your life you must never forget that you have roots this is the story of true facts that was made into a beautiful and moving movie i dare to say that this movie is well underrated this shows us a reality of life the more evil surrounds you the better person you become trust in your instincts and be aware that the ideal of life is to live it happy without grudges without living under a rock the movie concept is more that interesting connecting the storytelling with real life events keeping us aware of everything from facts to emotions bless these people and make everyone happy see it i recommend it to all young people it's not about racism it's about how to live your life
<START> a really sweet movie that has some similarities to the 2001 hit my sassy girl but is able to enchant most of the time the biggest applause should go to the two leads ha neul kim is both sweet and quirky sang woo kwon is both attractive and rebellious the chemistry between the two is very good br br director kyeong hyeong kim uses some cg inserts to pepper up the visuals and also offers impressive fight scenes in which sang woo kwon can shine i liked him a lot better here than in the highly overrated volcano high and that boy has a future those looks those fight techniques and a romantic lead not bad br br well i can make it short nice film my rating 7 10
<START> i thought that i was never going to find a horror movie as bad as the return of the texas chainsaw massacre but this film compete with it br br iÂ´m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie but i did it 15 minutes after the trance started i woke up and started to watching it agian why did i deserve that all the movie was a torture i have to use fast forward to watch it complete br br i canÂ´t stand why one of my favourites actors of all time mr walken could done this thing i have to think that he made the director a favor or he was really in the need of money because film after film he is doing he is ruining himself and so fast br br what about the movie itÂ´s not scary stupid plot characters are awful but i really liked the one played by jared harris effects are very poor lack of deaths blood etc in three words it has anything and i mean it canÂ´t stand how a director can make a film like this br br anyway when i got more disappointed was when i saw in the video cover that the film was presented by stephen king i think he could never present this crap no i rented it in argentina i not recommend it in a million years br br i rate this movie with a 2 out of 10 as i say in my return of the texas chainsaw massacre review there will be always a worse movies thats why it donÂ´t deserves a 1 out of 10
<START> i actually paid to see this movie in the theater br br it would get a 1 rating but the fight scenes between the robots are okay and there's a surprise br br i realize that some movies have larger budgets than others i don't have a problem with that unfortunately science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons but one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked cheesy and cheap i mean couldn't they even make it look good br br the other major reason this movie is horrible is the acting if i watched the movie now and knew what to expect i might just enjoy it for the cheese factor but at the time i was expecting a good movie and had no clue as to how horrible it would actually end up being br br thankfully the experience was over in only 85 minutes
<START> very intelligent humor excellent performing i can't believe how people could think it deserves a 1 10 i hope this movie will be shown everywhere so everyone can enjoy it if you ever have the opportunity watch it don't miss it there is a part when the principal actors are driving and singing happy birthday and el payaso plinplin an argentinian song for kids i think it could also be south american i'm not sure this two songs that have the same melody but people don't usually realize that it's just grate i tried to write this in both spanish and english because it's an argentinian movie but the page wouldn't allow me hope you enjoy it
<START> this is a more interesting than usual porn movie because it is a fantasy adventure the production values are high and the acting is believe it or not pretty good especially jenna jameson it s also in widescreen which helps it gives a feeling of a real motion picture and not a porn movie but of course it is a porn and a really good one with nice costumes fine atmosphere and scenery and by the way the sex is hot br br watch out for this one
<START> the brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary it's one of man's primal fears this movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room corbin bernsen gives a surprisingly non lackluster performance as a crazed dentist who i guess tries to kill people but he only works on their teeth so it's not really working out in a particularly gory scene we find so so actor earl boen having his teeth completely destroyed with drills and whatnot which i guess is the absolute worst you can do when you're a killer dentist it's a typical brian yuzna situation not well written but there's gore the plot is shoddy and at times seems to be made up on the spot but hey it's a killer dentist movie we've all thought of it but they did it first
<START> in a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe his girlfriend beth dorie barton discovers him and tries to commit suicide she's institutionalized a year later she's out has a new boyfriend named hank joseph lawrence and is about to spend spring break with hank and four other mindless friends in a big beautiful condo in florida naturally the killer pops up for no reason and starts killing again br br lousy slasher thriller a textbook example of how not to do a low budget horror movie for starters large portions of this film are endless filler of these six idiots videotaping themselves having fun more fun than the audience getting drunk acting stupid etc etc also there is no nudity in here at all i'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but anything to liven this up would have helped none of the deaths are really shown you hear them are only a little bloody and there is no gore there's one real gruesome one but that's not till the end br br with a few exceptions the acting sucks dorie barton is dreadful as the main woman and tom jay jones is lousy as oz chad allen pops up as brad and he's terrible lawrence is actually very good handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all and jeff conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job br br logic lapses abound after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex baston's non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and what happens to lawrence his character disappears without a trace at the end dull stupid no gore no nudity skip this one br br rated r for graphic violence and some profanity
<START> 'renaissance 2006 ' was created over a period of six years co funded by france luxembourg and the united kingdom at a cost of around Â14 million the final result is a staggering accomplishment of comic book style animation aesthetically similar to what robert rodriguez and frank miller achieved with 'sin city 2005 ' but this film employed motion capture with live actors to translate their faces and movements into an entirely animated format presented in stark black and white the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based and the futuristic city of paris looms ominously above us directed by french filmmaker christian volckman in his feature length debut 'renaissance' draws significantly from other films in the science fiction genre and the tech noir storyline isn't something we haven't seen before but from a technical standpoint it is faultless br br the year is 2054 the city of paris is a crumbling metropolis filled with dark alleys and deserted footpaths the recent installation of modern technology merely offering a thin mask to the pitiable degradation of the darkened buildings the city's largest corporation avalon achieved wealth through offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth and the company's research department is continually striving to invent greater means of eliminating the aging process ilona tasuiev voiced by romola garai in the english language version which i watched a brilliant young scientist is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work and so it falls to legendary detective barthÃ©lÃ©my karas daniel craig to uncover her current whereabouts possibly holding the key to the woman's disappearance is bislane catherine mccormack ilona's hardened elder sister whose trustworthiness is in question and jonas muller ian holm the dedicated medical doctor who adored ilona as his own daughter br br the eerie dimly lit city of paris is reminiscent of ridley scott's 'blade runner 1982 ' and some of the technology looks as though it might have been borrowed from tom cruise in 'minority report 2002 ' which was coincidentally also set in the year 2054 however despite this familiarity volckman has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit blending classic film noir and science fiction the result is an eye catching collage of harsh lighting and dark shadows which i should warn occasionally becomes difficult on the viewer's eyes the dialogue is a little banal at times and the story though engaging doesn't offer anything strikingly original except for the ending which i thought was a bold twist on the usual formula but 'renaissance' is intended to work best as a visual treat and that it succeeds in this regard cannot be denied
<START> there is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses are running if something red catches your eye it is because a white van is parked behind a bush by the trail i thought i had seen bad but this is it a white van in a western did they not catch this oh well and i paid top dollar at the rental it will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie the talking was so so slow the acting was mostly ok but couldn't be taken seriously due to the poor nature of the filming there is a door at the sheriffs that looks like a door today with the particular trimming i say watch this movie and move cabin boy into 2 on the worst of all time
<START> mighty morphin power rangers came out in 1993 supposedly based on the japanese sentai television show that started back in the 1970s now as a fan of japanese action films and series you would think i would get a kick out of this show br br you could not be more wrong what worked in the japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty morphin power rangers br br mmpr is based on five teenagers who get powers to becomes costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robot br br now this premise is more far fetched and more laughable than anything in either transformers movie yet the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked br br it was followed by two really bad and i do mean really bad movie knock offs and the actors starring in this series completely disappeared from the scene br br if you must choose try watching japan's zyuranger series instead br br also what's up with the awful long 1990s haircuts and all the earrings on the guys it makes them all look feminine
<START> john waters has made the most effusively buoyant heartfelt dark personal little film i think i've ever seen well maybe fast food fast women comes in close second the directors vision is untainted the narrative is whimsical the characters are personal and odd reflections of family and his own inner life the tone never forced or stylistically over arch br br there is no pretentious shot design ennui or magazine grading martha plimpton is amazing as the sister eddie furlong is inspired casting a grandmother with a talking mary tea bagging recycled clothing yesterday's garbage becomes today's art and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can value is family and a humble life
<START> wow i don't know what to say i just watched seven pounds no one can make me cry like will smith the man is very in tune with the vast range of human emotion this movie was skillfully and beautifully done rare to find such intense humanity in hollywood today i would compare it to pay it forward and crash as far as the show of both light and dark in such a raw way definitely sticks with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about i have a deep love for and passion about movies like this one not usually one for a bad ending but rather a truth seeker that embraces emotion raw life and something more than the shallowness that exists in abundance all around therefore i do not mind a little pain at the end it is true to life that there aren't always happy endings sometimes its just not the happy ending you think it should be many people were able to live happy lives though love and life of one was lost if you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest you'll love this movie
<START> dull predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated by a chemical substance weller who goes on across the country just to find his ex wife and children meanwhile he kills everyone in his way only by a single touch of his hands in his dangerous track a doctor hurt and a young reporter natasha try to stop the man the movie has a not original premise but even though could be much better the final result is just a movie without suspense or gritting moments even the good cast is completely waste i give this a 4 four
<START> this movie was rather awful vipul shah's last movie was good this one was just bad although it's a good story and is handled in a great way aatish kapadia who adapted this movie from another gujarati play avjo wahala fari malishu made a good but slow pianful 2 and a half hours to watch there are a lot of flaws in this movie but it's still a entertainer songs are rather bleaked out and don't work well but they're still good overall not a movie you would enthusiastically watch it's still a story to take in to account and it's good if you're the relationship type pretty good movie with loads of flaws and humor that's really not needed even one bit
<START> there is good there is bad and then their is the sentinel a bottom barrel political thriller that ranks among the worst movies i have ever seen the plot of a mole in the secret service is a good one but never has a movie with so much potential been so utterly butchered directed with ham handed edginess by clark johnson every actor in this film seems to be working on autopilot even the great michael douglas looks bored here i can honestly say i have never in all my life viewed another film with so many glaring plot holes the twist is predictable from square one and the character's motives are so utterly ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience avoid this at all costs this is a catastrophe of a movie with no redeeming value
