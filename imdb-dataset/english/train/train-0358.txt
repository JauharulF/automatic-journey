<START> the fluffer may have strong elements of porn industry truth to it but that doesn't make up for the fact that it's pretty shabbily directed and acted and with a very mediocre script br br b grade from start to the exceedingly drawn out finish br br it would be embarassing to think of the general public being offered this piece as an example of state of the art gay film making br br hopefully it has a limited life in the gay film festival circuit and is allowed to die a natural death on video br br this film will open the queer film weekend in brisbane on april 10 2002 i think its success there will be strongly influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed in the preceding cocktail party they're gonna need it
<START> by saying that i mean that this is not a well made movie but it's a very good version of the real event and the best depiction so far and if you are a ww2 buff then this is a treat for you cause there are three out of four saboteur members playing roles in this movie it's theater acting at best but then this is still as said before a semi documentary br br me personally am a die hard fan of our nearly over human heroes of the second world war and there should be hundreds of these movies showing us what they did so it won't get forgotten by next generations cause nowadays kids doesn't read books they watch movies br br so if you want a action extravaganza rent private ryan this is the truth about lingering pain outrageous endurance and the will to fight when all seems lost
<START> this movie deserved a working over on mystery science theater even though it has nothing whatever to do with king solomon it's worth a watch because it is an unintentional laugh riot really it's worse than destroy all monsters be sure to check out the following the cheesy medallion looks like the shriners have been here the obviously polyester norfolk jacket on allan quatermain david macallum's badly done stutter which does draw attention away from his even worse acting the incredibly bad process work on all the monsters the monsters themselves the hand puppet which menaces the little girl the giant snake that menaces macallum while he sinks in oatmeal the red lighted eyes on the motorized crabs the amazingly hilarious boat oh brother which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a leftover from a jr sr prom voyage into the future with the class of '71 the phoenician city where they wear roman imperial armor but which inexplicably has egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions the phoenicians invented the alphabet come on and worst of all macallum and ekland with her fright wig playing smoochy face oh the horror the best parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic frenchman and the african guy snuffleupagus or whatever evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in any more scenes
<START> meryl streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous lindy chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby azaria chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense based on the book evil angels and titled so in its australian release a cry in the dark is an ugly film to watch it presents a scenario that's all too real for us in america the witch hunt against a person deemed an easy target br br lindy chamberlain was this woman being someone who spoke her mind someone who didn't play the sympathy card and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn't kill her own child the media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece and through it all lindy remained as stoic as ever even when her husband michael was falling apart br br this stance of course is the power of strength as unsympathetic as it may look like and people happen to react strongly to that they want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn not sit there and look blank people don't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations meryl streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold but not unfeeling woman one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty because of her sam neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair someone has to or the chamberlains would be too detached and no one wants to see that except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news media they'll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public
<START> i remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television i remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel occupants being attacked by man eating ants what i didn't remember was how awful it was br br i recently caught this movie on television late at night i'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again suzanne somers at the pinnacle of her career playing chrissy on 'three's company' plays a vacationer at lakewood manor constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants' nest or should i say a man eating ants' nest one of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants one minute he's picking them off his clothes one by one the next minute he's covered in them the next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt br br if you thought that was pretty far fetched you should see myrna loy playing a wheel chair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the manor via helicopter i could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the movie br br the final scenes depict suzanne robert foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other blowing through straws and covered in ants br br that's basically the movie there's really no disaster appeal or big star draw to the film it was intended to be a 'grand scale' television event at the time now it's lucky if it gets dumped in a 4 00am timeslot on your local television station br br if you want to catch suzanne somers at her best then watch an episode of three's company if you want to see myrna loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills then watch this movie br br 0 10
<START> this hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale a young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy they spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence however after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence however out of no where when they are on a luxury cruise the ship sinks and they lose everything and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life what an odd silly and preachy film personally i'd like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable br br the production values are relatively poor compared to later productions a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting
<START> the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu starring peter sellers in a spoof of the characters created by sax rohmer is an injustice to the end of sellers' career the plot was very simplistic and if done the right way could have been handled nicely but instead it was poorly executed part of the reasons why this film wasn't that good was the poor dialog cheap laughs choppy directing and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete br br the acting on the other hand was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture i found sellers portrayal of diabolical manchu brilliantly done with the occasional lines that will be remembered for example there is the scene where fu manchu is confused which henchman is which in which he says ah you all look the same to me i hate to admit it but i laughed out loud with that line br br then of course a fistful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of helen mirren as the backstabbing constable david tomilson as sir roger avery his last film as well not a way to end a career and sid ceasar who gives a rather whimsical performance of al capone's relative who works for the fbi these characters also kept me watching br br the sets were also nice oriental designs and english society in 1933 was depicted with elegance in this dud of a picture br br in all honesty my advice to you is to watch the film if you are a peter sellers or sid ceasar fan otherwise you're better off settling on chewing aluminum foil
<START> enjoyable in spite of leslie howard's performance mr howard plays philip as a flat uninteresting character one is supposed to feel sorry for this man however i find myself cheering bette davis' mildred ms davis gives one her finest performances she received an academy award nomination thanks to her performance she brings this rather dull movie to life be sure not to miss when mildred tells philip exactly how she feels about him
<START> yes he is no not because of pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies pintilie is the naked emperor so to speak br br it's big time for someone to state the truth this impostor is a voyeur a brat locked in an old man's body his abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever it is 100 visual perversion he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies and if he does this in front of the audience he might eve get a hard on did you know that on the set of niki ardelean he used to embarrass poor coca bloss by telling her oh coca how i wanna f you she is a great lady very decent and sensitive and she became unspeakably ashamed to his petty satisfaction and as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in romanian audiences so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities works of art will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all
<START> i'm normally a sucker for romantic films which are well filmed and well acted out this is a romantic period film set in 17th century italy but filmed in french with english subtitles the fact that it is a period film means it will inevitably be slower paced than films set in the modern day era so it will bore some if you can overlook that fact it is actually a really good film the scenery the costumes and the cinematography are beautiful and the main actors and actress are very compelling in their portrayals projecting the intensity of the emotions that are running through the plot the story is like a sad love story with an unhappy ending its easy to believe that this is an accurate portrayal of the real life characters in spite of the fact that i was really moved by the main characters and the storyline i decided to check out the validity of the story and found out that the main theme of the movie's story that of an sad unfinished love story was completely fabricated br br in real life artemisia was raped by tassi initially rather than submitting to his advances willingly and passionately as the movie had portrayed she continued to have sexual relations with him only because he had repeatedly promised to marry her when they were in court he had not admitted guilt of rape out of pity for artemisia's torture unlike what the movie portrays in reality he had tried to portray artemisia as a loose promiscuous woman with insatiable sexual urges in the movie his sister testified in court that tassi had a wife and had sexual relations with his sister in law and tassi's character was all the while made to appear as if his sister had been slandering him regarding his alleged affair with his sister in law although he admits to having had a wife back in florence needless to say in reality it wasn't really like that at all in fact far from it tassi was really responsible in the planned murder of his wife whom he had begotten from rape and to add to that tassi really had sexual relations with his sister in law impregnating her in the process but all this wasn't really mutual as well again he had raped his sister in law before br br so now we have a clear picture of the real tassi as a multiple sex offender what do we make of the film artemisia's portrayal of him as a lover we take it as an attempt to make this movie into a romantic film that this film was never made to be historically accurate apart from these points just mentioned there were other historical inaccuracies like in its interpretation of artemisia's art in real life she was never really influenced by tassi's painting style and she was actually considered a much better painter than tassi ever was one thing remains true and its the fact that artemisia gentileschi has been credited as the first woman painter in history and although her mastery of the art rivalled many of her male peers she had always experienced difficulty in getting enough credit for her work because of her gender as a woman in 17th century italy br br enjoy this film for its own sake for it is a pretty good romantic drama but take its historical references with a grain of salt
<START> it's nothing brilliant groundbreaking or innovative but 'dog days' is for some reason an extremely fascinating character study it's like crash tripping on a bad dose of heroin but not really it's an austrian film following the lives of several depressed deranged and annoying people and their abusive relationships with each other it's disturbing yet very well acted and it's interesting to watch the crazy little things these characters do certainly not for the weak hearted this highly pessimistic film offers no conclusion or revelation at the end we just see the lives of these sordid individuals over the course of two days grade b
<START> this movie was very funny i couldn't stop smiling when watching this and have already watched it twice in a period of 2 days the movie is distinctively unique in it's humor and visuals both are terrific and on par with natali's other more serious movie gems cube and cypher i have become a huge vincenzo natali fan ever since watching cypher and everything he's made is very interesting br br very likable about this movie are the music and loser characters dave and andrew portrayed by david hewlett and andrew miller co writer of the story actors i both like very much also cool are the x box dead or alive fights you even see dave playing halo at a point and andrew's amazing guitar solo among many other things br br all in all a great feel good film about friendship you have to see this
<START> i'm overwhelmed by the work of jim carrey i keep on getting this movie stuck in my head the grinch liking martha may cindy lou who's very annoying her sweet innocence who tries to get the grinch in the christmas spirit the childhood of the grinch very funny and moreover the weak obvious ending with christmas isn't all about presents i have to say i felt stupid walking out of the theater with a bunch of babies and toddlers laughing and so forth but this movie was a good full lengthed adaption of dr seuss's short film and is for all ages
<START> this movie was fantastic great movie all through scary as hell and i mean it freaked me out as much as pulse and it and the omen etc but with a great movie comes a crap ending right right this movies ending was pathetic stuff i mean a ghost turned back time in a chicks house and it thinks now i have done that it means i can call her and itll be the right time cause she thinks it is right wrong my ass i don't care if the ghost is satan it just doesn't happen its a movie yes but most evil movies or praised movies like this are meant to make sense but it didn't it just showed us what i just said and people don't think anything of it can someone please tell me why you all haven't noticed that pathetic part the movie for me ended in the hospital and that is all check out number 3 its much more kick ass
<START> it's the same old if i can't get the funding for my project i'll inject myself monster movie there is nothing new here it's a lot like the jeff goldblum fly movie the man manages to keep some semblance of sanity but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiments the acting is pretty bad there are people acting stupidly all along the way putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason the guy keeps going back to the lab he has been forbidden to enter then there's his relationship with a young woman and her son admittedly he is good looking but he seems like a lot of trouble it's just a pretty big waste of time even his tyrannosaurus suit looks like it came off the rack at a star trek convention
<START> greetings again from the darkness much anticipated twisted comedy from writer director richard shepard is a coming out party for pierce brosnan the actor that bond guy is gone this new guy is something else entirely have read that shepard thought brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role but brosnan proves to be the perfect julian noble facilitator and is anything but pretty do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one if you go expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex killing religion sports business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements even sitting on a hotel bed with or without a sombrero is a joy to behold br br greg kinnear is the straight guy to brosnan's comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click hope davis has a small but subtly effective supporting role as kinnear's wife what's with her name bean who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living room br br the visuals and settings are perfect including a bullfight racetrack and denver suburb and how often do we get the killers and xavier cugat on the same soundtrack this one is definitely not for everyone but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky film making it could be for you
<START> i didn't enjoy this movie at all for one i just found it crude and vulgar for no reason i also felt it's misogynistic against women also the movie really doesn't appear to be about anything and i didn't find any of the characters likable really the there doesn't seem to be any point to it all maybe i'm missing something but for me this movie is pretty much a waste of time when i could have been doing something more productive and enjoyable like using my face as a pin cushion james garner is in this thing as are c thomas howell and shirley jones and james cromwell all are wasted here and i'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers jennilee harrison from the later years of three's company is also in the movie and it is nice to see her in a non ditsy role but other than that she can't rise above the mediocre script for me tank is a 3 10
<START> acting was weak but in a horror flick i can live with that if the story is good it wasn't the initial event was an clumsy and obvious ploy to exploit most people's adoration of kids ok fine fast forward to the place in the country where they will recover emotionally i like the revelation of the ghosts ok cool this will be a supernatural kinda horror story with rotting things partly in our world partly in where ever then the action starts pulling like a three headed dog in a flurry of cats and birds is there an evil force trying to attack them directly is there an evil force trying to attack them indirectly make people do awful things they wouldn't really do oh wait no maybe the whole region is some kind of psychic echo chamber where ambient discord can reverberate into murder ok hold on maybe it's really just one little mentally tangled delbert style redneck boy who misses his mommy and is on some kind of spree like a k tel norman bates knock off oh yeah extra points off the only black character seems to be the grandson of an our gang pullman porter the actor plays it as straight as he can given the crummy dialogue but the fact is his purpose is y'all done betta get outa heah boss at least they wrote him smart enough to gtf outta there the bit with the little girl being silenced and pulled away was definitely creepy as was the chick in the shower those were just two of quite a few really delicious tidbits in this movie the problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways like a bite of steak a bite of chocolate and a bite of a gummi bear each is great on it's own but mixed up bleah such potential wasted
<START> i have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film one thing i see over and over is annoyance with megan the idealistic political scientist trying to change the world i loved her character maybe because i am a 23 year old political science student and i think i'm going to change the world too so i relate to megan besides she's cute she's no super model but more of a cute girl next door br br ok so she cried and screamed a lot it's very dramatic and seems overdone but doesn't it fit her character she goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point she thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick i think she made her argument very well of course being a young naive girl she is terrified of what she is about to face i think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear furthermore i think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in br br as for the movie in general other than megan it was pretty much what i expected it had excellent gore scenes by micro budget standards the plot maybe took a quick thought hardly any contemplation it's basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film which the name implies i love the sadism of the doctor he kept ripping megan's shirt off not just for the cause of sleaze though largely so but also to torment her before he kills her the chainsaw hick was hilarious for slasher film lovers he was probably the best character br br i give this film 4 out of 10 it had a good setting almost no plot and a mix of good and terrible acting i would recommend it for a cheap thrill but hardly a diamond in the rough that is micro budget horror
<START> for those who think it is strictly potty humor and immaturity you are in fact the mindless one while the show does contain its share of potty jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and pokes fun at social problems racial barriers clichÃ©'s stereotypes etc you just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it br br what i also love is that not everything is a punchline for those expecting a formulated joke like friends i love friends fyi you won't find it here instead sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humour which is more realistic we don't walk around in this world and have witty punchlines for everything said which is in most comedies instead the sarah silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense br br so don't take it as mindless humor because it is so much more than that
