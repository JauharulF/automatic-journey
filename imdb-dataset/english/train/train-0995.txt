<START> i have to say although i despise these kind of shows shock horror i'm a girl i feel i have to express my opinion i had seen dirty sanchez before i saw jackass and think it way surpasses jackass in terms of programme making story lines and interviews are inter weaved to create a more interesting show i saw a few minutes of jackass movie the other night and couldn't believe how poorly put together it was everything just put in a line joke after joke with no relation between anything it must have been the quickest easiest show to edit ever shockingly amateur while drinking puke isn't really my thing as far as a substantial entertainment show goes dirty sanchez is way out of jackass's league
<START> a fierce shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted british writer hanif kureishi who wrote my beautiful laundrette this is the best thing he's done since then it's about intelligent people whose lives don't add up to much they've squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels the only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex he has his own motives but kureishi treats him with a good deal of compassion this is a film in which people and places feel familiar where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen in some respects it's a bit like sunday bloody sunday but it's an altogether tougher piece of work the director roger michell allows scenes to build instinctively and it is beautifully acted br br as the eponymous mother anne reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture there is not a false note in her extraordinarily lived in performance and that very fine actor daniel craig displays shadings to his character than even kureishi hasn't tapped into if the film strikes a false note it is perhaps in the character of the talentless daughter caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces or should that be the other way round and even messier life but she is so well played by cathryn bradshaw she hooks you in nevertheless the film is also extremely beautiful to look at dop alwin kuchler and must rank unhesitatingly as the best british film of the year
<START> sometimes i rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and or crocodiles are still getting made these days they've been making these lame jaws copies since the 70s it's not like they're getting any more well liked the idea is still exactly the same so we have an animal that starts murdering people first it takes down some secondary characters then it starts attacking the main characters usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous who usually plays a specialist one of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow usually with an explosion then we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive or has laid eggs etc etc krocodylus basically uses the same overused ideas and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation unless you count the fact that the specialist is a captain in this one variation in that case your standards are pretty low it's funny that he's played by duncan regehr though he like totally used to be zorro hell i'll give it a bonus point for that
<START> obviously a lot of talented behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie so don't even look at the credits at the end you'll only hold it against them nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie only 3 were in the theater two passed out after 10 minutes and they were the lucky ones the 'monsters' were the unemployed worm from star trek 2 the wrath of khan and rejected designs for the space creatures in alien the creators of the movie obviously didn't want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn't get to memorize their lines or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening if anything is if you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing and you don't pass out you'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film the implausibility of several scenes will just stun you and stephen dorff's regular spewing of the 'queen mary of curse words' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this if you must see this movie do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the bargain bin at the video store if there's any justice in the film industry one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you
<START> amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best selling philosophical novel the celestine prophecy which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in peru home video quality actors present so called characters spewing overwrought exposition and metaphysical hokum while the film is propelled by the extremely heavy handed direction of armand mastroianni even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of abc's lost or dan brown's the da vinci code the filmmakers are hardly up to the task this film reeks of ill conceived mass consumption spiritual propaganda and the results are so awful few can wade through this mess to spot a real point
<START> a great gangster film sam mendes has directed this beautiful movie showing another father son camaraderie brilliant star cast leading with tom hanks michael sullivan has done a terrific job great acting by him again he is an acting legend great acting too from paul newman jude law and daniel craig casting is just too good the plot is quite good you will enjoy the movie a great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930's set in the 1930's this will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that era soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie a great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son way underrated for my liking deserved a fully deserved 10
<START> i have seen many a horror flick in my time all of them absurdly bad but none reach the depths that this piece of trash lowers itself to this movie made me angrier and angrier as i watched it as i tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about now after i've seen it i understand sort of what was going on and why but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when you're watching it yes there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence one liners that show the mind blowing insightfulness of its characters the highway belongs to me me and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the plot but still you'll leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of like a puppy who isn't wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road blech
<START> well you know the rest this has to be the worst movie i've seen in a long long time i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role br br the lead role is played by to me a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey br br bruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts however even this can't disguise the fact that the lady doesn't know how to throw a punch an average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing br br sorry the only mystery on show here is how this didn't win the golden raspberry for its year
<START> the original vampires 1998 is one of my favorites i was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters i was quite surprised at how this played out as a rule sequels are never as good as the original with a few exceptions though this one was not a great movie the writer did well in keeping the main themes vampire lore from the first one in tact jon bon jovi was a drawback initially but he proved to be a half way decent slayer i doubt anyone could top james wood's performance in the first one though unless you bring in buffy br br all in all this was a decent watch i would watch it again br br i was left with two questions though what happened to jack crow how did derek bliss come to be a slayer guess we'll just have to leave that to imagination
<START> it has only been a week since i saw my first john waters film female trouble and i wasn't sure what to expect the second time around br br while the previous film was outrageously over the top pecker is actually a funny film that satirizes the art critics in new york to a t anyone who cannot imagine what these experts find so appealing about modern art will enjoy seeing these pretentious snobs get so full of themselves over pecker a boy who just found a broken camera and starts shooting his friends and neighbors br br edward furlong pet sematary ii terminator 2 judgment day was surprisingly good as pecker there wasn't a lot of meat on any of the roles in this film but he really shines br br christina ricci prozac nation comes in with another great performance as pecker's girlfriend in fact it was a banner year for ricci buffalo '66 the opposite of sex and pecker br br lili taylor who had the only good role in the haunting was also a significant part of the film and really made it enjoyable br br there are many funny scenes but i have to say the best was when a crown gathers screaming we want bush we want bush we want bush i thought it was a republican convention until i saw the police hauling off the dancer br br i am going to have to look for more of waters' work especially hairspray now that that is in the news
<START> i went to see this movie actually i went to see family portraits which contains cutting moments 2 other short films by douglas buck at the mar del plata festival argentina i just couldn't watch it i had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of cutting moments and take a peek every once in a while by the time it was over my stomach was upside down and i felt light headed i just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short begun btw of course i was not the only one who left the room it was waaaay too violent and disgusting for me i am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it i just don't get how you can love that kind of movies the shocking and bloody and horrible images i saw got really stuck in my head for like two days i also try to analyze the story my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it and i just don't think it makes any sense i mean that amount of violence and stuff makes no other sense than to try to shock people and that's not a good enough reason i think there's absolutely nothing in this movie that i can say well at least 'x' thing about it was good but well i guess i will never understand that kind of films
<START> although super mario 64 isn't like the rest of the games in the series it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games games with this much replay value are few and far between plus this game has so much variety there are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can do and many other hidden tasks the game isn't very challenging but its lack of challenge doesn't take away from the game at all once you beat it you'll want to erase your game and start again and its just as much fun the second time or third time or two hundredth time a must own for any nintendo 64 owner and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo 64
<START> unless i'm sadly mistaken i rented a nightmare on elm street 3 several years ago and there was a music video i'm pretty sure which was called dream warriors at the end of it and i rented this one on dvd hoping that the video would be there because it was one of the funniest things i've ever seen it's amazing how stuff from the 80s is so funny now but nothing is funnier than 80s rap videos there was this rap group singing that song dream warriors on the vhs version of this movie after the credits and they're all wearing like denim jackets with no shirt underneath and form fitting jean shorts that are all frayed at the bottoms like daisy dukes what could make a rap group look more foolish i can't imagine br br spoilers at any rate i was disappointed in looking for that video on the dvd version so all i had was this mediocre installment in the freddy krueger series the movie sort of starts off with the same idea as part 2 with the main character witnessing all kinds of gruesome murders and then sort of coming out of a trance and finding himself with the bloody hands kristen parker patricia arquette has a nightmare about the infamous house that nancy thompson used to live in then runs to the bathroom the sink's handles turn into freddy's hands and attack her and then she wakes up standing in her bathroom having slit her own wrists from there the movie turns into the usual mental hospital installment br br larry' fishburne tired of always playing the bad guy in his roles was happy to take on the role in this film as a nice guy orderly stern but accommodating when the patients want to bend the rules a little not surprisingly he turns in what is by leaps and bounds the best performance in the movie arquette later goes on to become an accomplished actor but had not perfected her acting skills when she starred in this film the characters in the movie are mostly all patients at the mental hospital that kristen is placed into after cutting her wrists all of them are cynical and uncooperative almost none believing that they really belong there at all eventually they realize and are able to convince the staff that they are all having dreams about the same man and it's not just some kind of group hysteria br br heather langenkamp has returned in her famous role as nancy thompson this time grown up into a dream researcher as a result of her childhood experiences involving freddy krueger not surprisingly she is able to quickly relate to the hysterical kristen and the rest of the patients since she had experienced exactly what they're going through there are some interesting murders in this installment and the technology used for the special effects have taken a huge jump there is a gigantic worm like freddy that tries to swallow kristen whole there is a scene where a television turns into freddy and with mechanical arms he picks up one of the patients there for some late night entertainment and punishes her for sitting too close to the tv but there is also an unconvincing go motion scene where a couple guys have a fight with freddy krueger's skeleton which has been rotting in the trunk of some car in a car junkyard and one of the more groan inducing scenes was one where freddy attacks one of the patients in his dream the one famous for sleepwalking tearing the muscles and tendons out of his arms and legs and leading him around like a puppet ouch br br we get a peek into freddy's past in this installment not only do we meet his mother but we also find out the circumstances that led to freddy being fathered by more than 100 maniacs in fighting freddy the patients all band together and in their dreams use their special powers most of which reflect their shortcomings in real life to fight him one student bound to a wheelchair is able to walk in his dreams another has the hilarious powers of what he calls the wizard master ' another is beautiful and bad' she has lots of makeup her hair stands up in a foot high mohawk and she has knives clever but the movie falters when it has only one of the patients the one who can't speak not have any powers in his dreams until the climax of the movie when he suddenly realizes that he can talk in his dreams at just the right moment to save the day his dream power was a little too obvious to have been left out for that long but collectively now you see why the movie was subtitled dream warriors br br altogether this is not an entirely weak entry into the series the acting is pretty shoddy but it's actually pretty good for a horror movie larry fishburne vastly overshadows the rest of the cast displaying wonderful acting skills early on in his career and the movie is not simply a rehash of either of the first two Â a problem that plagues the friday the 13th movies much more than the elm street films the characters are never developed enough to allow for the later creation of much tension which is why most of the deaths come across more as creative ways to kill off someone in a horror film than the tragic loss of the life of one of the characters that we've come to know and root for their triumph over evil but then again not a lot of horror movies take the time to really develop their characters to the point where you throw up your hands in defeat when they are killed or are on the edge of your seat as they run for their lives but it's important to note that the few horror films that actually do that are almost invariably the best onesÂ
<START> as far as horror flicks go this one is pretty darn good while it may not be a classic tale of horror and suspense it does provide many quality chuckles that make this movie a must see if you're into the horror comedy genre
<START> take a scifi original movie and mix in a little alternative revisionist history and you get aztec rex apparently hernand cortes before conquering the aztec empire had to first conquer a tyrannosaurus rex and her mate that's the thrust of this movie given the plot it could have really sucked the fact that it only kind of sucked is a tip of the cap to the writers there are a few problems for starters cortes is played by ian ziering even with a black wig ziering as cortes is about as convincing as axl rose playing gandhi and though cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of mexico the aztecs here seem to be played by an all hawaiian ensemble casting aside the t rex es look reasonably good though every time one of them gets shot it just oozed cgi and they die too easily i suppose if a t rex were around in real life they probably could be felled or at least wounded by some rather rudimentary 16th century weaponry but it takes something away from the movie there are also some graphic t rex swallowing human scenes which is surprising but in this context i thought they worked ok there's plenty of action and the whole colonization angle is prevalent throughout but doesn't overwhelm the dinosaur angle unlike the other recent scifi original dinosaur movie warbirds overall a mediocre but decent by scifi original standards movie that rates a modest 4
<START> if you like bad movies this is the one to see it's incredibly low budget special effects you'll see what i mean and use of non actors was what gave this film it's charm if you're bored with a group of friends i highly recommend renting this b movie gem it's mulletrific
<START> there are two things that i like about elvira and they're both bigger than she is and she keeps them covered up her wit and her talent a movie is the best thing to show off how funny she can be or how she commands attention looking like a combined clone of morticia adams and anna nicole smith she inherits a distant relative's estate only to discover that she is really the heiress of the occult the comedy in this movie is the best thing about it but it could have been a lot more scary and chilling it's mostly a campy fare with as many bad horror movie references in it such as the rioting mob or the fleeing heroine who trips and stumbles on her heels my favorite part is when she uses her marvelous endowments to break the chains keeping her locked in the cemetary the ending is sappingly sweet as if it were written by the bradys but the las vegas act at the end seems too grandiose for this type of movie
<START> ronald reagan and a bunch of us soldiers in a north korean pow camp they are tortured we learn north korean communists are bad people we learn americans' beards grow very slowly during days of torture br br i tried to suppress it but i finally burst out laughing at this movie it was the scene when mr reagan comes out from telling the communists he wants to be on their side then he asks for a bottle of brandy next acting stone cold sober he takes a drunken companion dewey martin to get sulfur to cure mr martin's hangover of course the north korean communist guard is as dumb as they come so the drunk distracts the guard while reagan goes over to get something from a drawer which is next to a bunch of empty boxes i'm sure he boxes were supposed to contain something but of course reagan causes them to shake enough to reveal they are empty ya gotta laugh i think prisoner of war will appeal mainly to family and friends of those who worked on it otherwise it's wasteful br br prisoner of war 1954 andrew marton ronald reagan steve forrest dewey martin
<START> i disagree with anyone who done't like this movie br br i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do it's sweet funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed br br and even though it didn't have much of a story it was still excellent i give it a 10 and two thumbs up br br oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wish's and dreams can come true tear tear br br i love this movie personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful little movie and i'm glad that at least some people liked it
<START> thirty years after its initial release the third version of a star is born finally comes to dvd in a package that should please the most devoted fans of barbra streisand that would include me since i just saw her in concert singing among other numbers the feminist anthem woman in the moon from this 1976 film easy to dismiss the movie's career polarizing story is such a sturdy pile of hollywood style clichÃ©s that variations of it exist in other films including streisand's own funny girl this time reset to the then contemporary music scene the timeworn plot follows self destructive rock star john norman howard on his deep dive career descent just as he meets club singer esther hoffman who is awaiting her big break br br troubles dog their courtship from the outset as john norman both names please responds to grasping fans and bloodless djs with random acts of violence from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution to john norman esther represents his last shot at happiness and in turn she is drawn to the innately decent creative musician underneath the faÃ§ade in the movie's most pivotal scene he gives esther her big break at a benefit concert and her career takes off inevitably he can't handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success and if you are familiar with any version of this story you know the rest directed by frank pierson although streisand's budding directorial talents are obviously on display the film still manages to draw me in even though i know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative it still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flaws br br although streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play esther credibly the same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer adult contemporary oriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock from the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the oreos she can't help but come across as an established star i can forgive the lapse simply because she is an unparalleled vocal talent but what becomes less forgiving is how she makes esther more strident than poignant when john norman's woes become overwhelming this creates an oddly discomfiting dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than esther's response to it this is capped off by an uninterrupted eight minute close up of her memorial performance great except when she regrettably mimics john norman's style toward the end br br kristofferson on the other hand gives a superb performance throughout managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love pride and resentment toward esther he makes his vodka soaked onstage growling work within this context otherwise what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are relegated to the background as if they didn't exist unless they were interacting with the two principals the only ones who register are paul mazursky as john norman's level headed manager brian and gary busey as his cynical band manager bobbie veteran cameraman robert surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print a big seller in its day the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of different styles from the 1970's some songs still quite good everything woman in the moon watch closely now some that have moved to kitsch queen bee kenny loggins' i believe in love and of course the inescapable evergreen br br the print transfer on the 2006 dvd is clean and the sound gratefully crisp thanks to digital remastering streisand's participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her feature length commentary she gives insightful information about the genesis of the film the casting and the reportedly troubled production she is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of jon peters her hairdresser boyfriend who became the movie's producer and her dissatisfaction with pierson as a director i just wish she could have provided more scene specific comments that directly relate to what is on screen she also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood strikes her e g it gets tiring to hear for the third time how the person playing the chauffeur was a friend of peters i think having a second commentator could have drawn out other nuggets from her br br there is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing 1970's clothes especially kristofferson's mixed fabric poncho and orange polyester shirt there are also twelve deleted scenes included with streisand's optional commentary one is a comic bread baking scene which reminded me how much i like streisand in farcical comedies another is an extended scene in which she plays evergreen on the guitar in front of an awestruck kristofferson who then falls asleep the most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts which i agree with streisand should have been used fittingly the theatrical trailers for all three versions of a star is born are also included
