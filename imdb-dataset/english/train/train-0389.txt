<START> it's a good movie if you plan to watch lots of landscapes and animals like an animal documentary and making pierce brosnan an indian make you wonder 'does all those people don't recognize if someone isn't indian at plain sight '
<START> brilliant actor as he is al pacino completely derails revolution Â his method acting approach is totally ill suited to the role of an illiterate trapper caught up in the american war of independence much of the blame should be attributed to director hugh hudson yes the man who made chariots of fire just a couple of years earlier Â talk about a come down one of the many jobs of a director is to marshal the actors coaxing believable performances from them but in this case hudson has allowed pacino to run amok without asking for restraint of any kind it's not just al's career low performance that hinders the film though there are numerous other flaws with revolution more of which will be said later br br illiterate trapper tom dobb al pacino lives in the north eastern region of america with his son ned sid owen dexter fletcher he leads a simple life Â living off the land raising his son surviving against the elements the country is lorded over by the english colonialists but during an eight year period 1775 83 a revolution takes place which ends with the british being defeated and the independent american nation being born dobb gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are conscripted by the continental army Â swept away by events they can barely understand the dobbs finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another tom also falls in love with daisy mcconnahay natassja kinski a beautiful and fiery woman of british aristocratic ancestry their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting br br where to start with the film's flaws most key actors are miscast Â pacino has been criticised enough already but kinski fares little better as the renegade aristocrat while donald sutherland is hopelessly lost as a ruthless english soldier with a wobbly yorkshire accent robert dillon's script is muddled in its attempts to bring massive historical events down to a personal level at no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the american revolution as a backdrop or an epic war film with a handful of sharply drawn characters used to carry the story along as a result the narrative falls into no man's land flitting from grand spectacle to small story indiscriminately and meaninglessly john corigliano's score is quite ghastly and is poured over the proceedings with neither thought nor subtlety hugh hudson's direction is clumsy throughout both in his mismanagement of pacino and the other key actors and in the decision to use irritatingly shaky camera work during the action sequences the idea of the hand held camera is to create immediacy Â that feeling of being there in the confusion of battle and musket fire like so many other things in the film it doesn't work the one department where the film regains a modicum of respectability is the period detail with costumes sets and weaponry that look consistently accurate but if it's period detail you're interested in a trip to the museum would be a better way to spend your time because as a rousing cinematic experience revolution doesn't even begin to make the grade nothing more than a Â£18 000 000 mega bomb that the ailing british film industry could ill afford in the mid 1980s
<START> shakespeare's plays have a way of transcending time the language somehow breaks the time barrier but perhaps it is the actors who really do that br br after the disappointment in romeo and juliet the version with claire danes and leonardo dicaprio was hesitant take on another modern rendition of shakespeare to my surprise othello was great br br iago's character was played so well by the kenneth fellow even thoough iago is really evil and despicable the character was played so well that it does what shakespeare intended for the charater to be a pleasure for the audience to hate i have to say that fishburne's performance here was really good as well br br i recommend this for shakespeare scholars and lazy students who refuse to read the book alike
<START> a damsel in distress is definitely not one of fred astaire's better musicals but even astaire's bad films always had some good moments br br in damsel astaire is jerry halliday an american musical star who is in london on a personal appearance tour he meets lady alice marshmorton 19 year old joan fontaine a beautiful english heiress who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers br br jerry believes that alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt he tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor lady alice will marry keggs reginald gardiner the conniving butler and albert harry watson the bratty house boy each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging lady alice's romance with jerry to make sure they win the bet br br this musical has numerous problems first there is the plot based on a novel by p g wodehouse who co wrote the screenplay the story is slow painful and nerve grating when fred is not dancing we have to endure endless annoying scenes of a fred romancing joan fontaine or b keggs and albert conniving against them and each other br br the butler and the house boy are especially irritating they are one dimensional stock villain characters the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth you wish they would get off the screen and let fred dance br br astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner ginger rogers joan fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film and is miscast in a musical she has little going for her character wise other than her lovely face and beautiful smile br br george burns and gracie allen are along for the ride as jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary the duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot and gracie has some funny lines but she is also very annoying at times br br the direction of the movie by george stevens is not well done at times the cinematography is horrible and off focus there are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets to try to convince the audience that we are in london not hollywood they must have used tons of dry ice in this movie on the plus side the songs by george and ira gershwin are terrific and have become classic song standards and of course the dancing in the movie is exceptional thanks to astaire and his choreographer hermes pan br br but the musical and dance numbers are ill used and ill staged at times the cast seems to start singing and dancing because well it's time for them to start singing and dancing the musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot at one point the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason the numbers include ï· i'm dancing and i can't be bothered now fred dances well on a foggy traffic filled london street he does some great cane twirling with a rolled umbrella but the number ends too soon when fred jumps on a passing double decker bus in the broadway musical crazy for you harry groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls br br ï· put me to the test fred george and gracie do a trio tap dance in an english cottage george and gracie match fred step for step but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason br br ï· stiff upper lip the fun house number at an amusement park fun house fred george and gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor rotating barrel and with the fun house mirrors it's the best number of the movie but it gets a little repetitious at times br br ï· things are looking up fred and joan fontaine do their one dance number together in the film prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate fortunately it's a very simple dance number because joan is not a great dancer br br ï· a foggy day in london town fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night crooning about the foggy day when he first met joan in london at times he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog much like the musical number itself br br ï· nice work if you can get it a great song that is misused in the movie during a social event at the manor house fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song each time fred joins in the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave again harry groener did a better dance number with this song in crazy for you ï· drum dance number as fred and joan are eloping fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums as usual it's a great dance number but there's absolutely no need for it except to prolong the movie br br the most contrived moment in the film comes when fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for joan fontaine as he leaps from the balcony he finds a conveniently placed trapeze that's right a trapeze hanging from a nearby tree fred or rather a stuntman in fred's clothes grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it br br the movie is worth owning on dvd for the dance numbers alone but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the fast forward button on your remote the ff button allows you to skip through the other boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers
<START> i must preface this by saying i am a huge romantic hence i really wanted to like this film so i'm writing my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment i felt watching it the leap years tells the destiny filled tale of li ann who falls for the suave jeremy and they commit to meet every leap year a very romantic premise based on a great short story and with a cast that doesn't feel like you're watching yet another jack neo flick then why oh why is it so bad firstly i feel the filmmakers thought they were shooting a music video because they chose to replace storytelling and any true emotions with cheesy montages predictable actions and clichÃ©d lines i am both upset and embarrassed to have been one of the first few in singapore to watch the leap years but those of us in the cinema would agree that our muffled groans at the cringe worthy performances spoke volumes my hope was to watch a romantic movie that would surpass forever fever the best singaporean romantic comedy so far and the leap years does not even come close some blogs have called it the crap years which is harsh but ultimately true don't waste your money or your emotions like i did the movie will make you give up on love forever
<START> it's been about 14 years since sharon stone awarded viewers a leg crossing that twisted many people's minds and now god knows why she's in the game again basic instinct 2 is the sequel to the smash hit erotica basic instinct featuring a sexy stone and a vulnerable michael douglas however fans of the original might not even get close to this one since instinct 2 is painful film making as the mediocre director michael caton jones assassinates the legacy of the first film br br the plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning catherine tramell sharon stone trying to look forcefully sexy is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder a psychiatrist a horrible david morrisey is appointed to examine her but eventually falls for an intimate game of seduction br br and there it is without no further explanations the basic force that moves this instinct nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy c class erotic film sharon stone stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turn off part of it because of the amateurish writing the careless direction and terrifyingly low chemistry the movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality a menage a trois scene was cut off so that this wouldn't be rated nc 17 than the first entrance in the series instinct is a compelling torture br br to top it off everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film the acting here is really bad sharon stone has some highlights but here she gets extremely obnoxious david morrisey stars in the worst role of his life and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie confused and aroused instinct 2 is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series that managed to put in thriller with erotica extremely well paul verhoeven how i miss you br br basic instinct 2 never sounded like a good movie and indeed it isn't some films should never get out of paper and that is the feeling you get after watching this now it is much easier to understand why douglas and david cronenberg dropped out and why sharon stone was expecting a huge paycheck for this 3 10
<START> question how does a bourgeois director treat a subject like immigration answer by turning it into an existential alienation parable br br yes we're back in the early 90s just after the disintegration of the eastern block and the subsequent flooding of immigrants in the european union and what better way to deal with the subject than making a film about an existentially alienated middle class journalist an existentially alienated upper class politician his existentially alienated rich wife and so on br br in the background immigrants are asking for political asylum in an unnamed greek village near the borders i guess that way angelopoulos can show some social awareness while dealing with the existentially troubled upper classes i mean honestly the scene where some top ranking army officer curses his destiny cause he sent his daughter to study in london is enough to make you puke br br anyway it can't be that bad angelopoulos is a master of the cinematic art after all right wrong it's at this point when his mannerisms start getting too artificial sort of like a filtered image in photoshop his usual tricks show up there are blurred windows blurred lights a weird wedding a walk by the river shore and people with yellow water coats also mastroianni breaks new ground for most sleepwalking performance ever avoid really go for his early films
<START> i wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie its a big joke good its entertaining you get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film i wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted to br br priety a pros plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple salman rani who want a child but can't i wonder how it would be if this drama was a real life take off from a real couple's life br br rani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her salman she cares for priety and tries pushing her husband salman to preity so they may have some romance when will the audience get fed up of salman's nakhras br br though a good past time this movie is unbearable absurd
<START> i watched this movie with some curiosity i wanted to see if 1 paul muni could play chinese and 2 luise rainer deserved her oscar i came away from the film thinking yes having seen muni in only one film where he was quite hammy i expected the same type of performance here i was happily proved wrong although some might criticize him as being too childlike and stereotypically simple in the hollywood idea of asians i thought he was just right in the role keye luke if he'd been given the chance to play a lead role might have played him in much the same manner br br i was particularly impressed by the camera work and the use of crowd scenes especially during the sacking of the palace where o lan was once a slave the graphic and grim atmosphere of the firing squad and the drought made this an epic quite unlike others of the same time where it was all glitz and glitter i watched this film from beginning to end enthralled i can't say the same for the epics of today
<START> most action films are crass of hindi cinema especially of sunny and his family br br the film is typical sunny type with bashes big dialogues and melodrama br br the film also has typical rajiv rai ingredients of many henchmen and a weird villain br br the starting is okay and then the shift to kenya is good but then the film goes on and on br br the sequence of events move at a slow pace and nothing that great happens br br they are many stupid scenes like the kenya policemen are shown like jokers especially sharat br br the climax too is prolonged br br rajiv rai does an okay job music is okay only 1 song works and that is the last toofan camera work is good br br sunny deol is as usual chunky acts like a monkey while his serious scenes are laughable naseer is alright heroines are pure wood amrish puri is not even half as scary as he was in tridev the rest are okay
<START> i enjoyed this film very much many korean people will feel familiar with this film because many of them have tutors when they go to school cinematography was average the movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera was more irregular editing however was very neat and unusual br br the acting was also very good kim ha neul usually played an innocent weak girl in the korean soap opaeras but this time she plays a cute tomboy very well kwon sang woo also plays his role very believable br br what i like the most about this film is the emotion of the characters are not too exaggerated there are many korean romance films that the characters cry river before the audience and i always thought it was very stale there was no such crap in this movie br br very funny and well done
<START> as the film opens two thugs kill another thug when the body is discovered and about to be autopsied the doctor realizes that although the man was shot dead he was also suffering from the pneumonic plague a very nasty and more virulent version of the bubonic plague so it's a race against time to find those who came in contact with the dead man and treat them immediately otherwise a disaster could erupt br br oddly i actually know quite a bit about the pneumonic plague as i taught a series of lectures on it for my history classes the film really did not do a good job of getting the facts right about the disease in that it looked little like what the people had in the movie the biggest problem is that this illness is so incredibly grotesque that in 1950 they really wouldn't have been allowed to show it sure there is high fever and coughing they got this right but also lots of bleeding and explosive vomiting of blackened blood along with the enormously swollen lymph nodes like you'd get with the bubonic plague all purply and gross i can certainly understand why they didn't go this far also i am sure that the federal government would have had a much much greater involvement in controlling and treating the disease here in the film it was handled on a very local level and everyone seemed ill prepared and a bit dumb no one seemed willing to believe the doctors as for the acting the film had some excellent actors here richard widmark and paul douglas are respectively the public health doctor and police chief good actors but also known actors back in 1950 however in his first film is the very menacing jack palance still going by his original moniker 'walter jack palance' as well as the relatively unknown at the time zero mostel palance was great very scary and very physically adept in his own stunts mostel played a heavy typical of his early work a greasy and cowardly sort of evil br br overall despite really not getting the details right and wrapping everything up a little too neatly the film is very tense and has excellent acting and is well worth seeing
<START> gosha's last great film of the 1960's a resolute stylist with a great sense of purpose to his films gosha teamed up with shintaro katsu of zatoichi fame to produce this scathing indictment of mindless nationalist loyalty br br tenchu heavenly judgment is the word that the loyalists to the emperor yell while assassinating enemies or traitors to the cause katsu plays up his character' simple minded allegiance to a manipulative politician all in the name of patriotic pride anybody who questions the politician is labeled a traitor and becomes an assassination target br br one of the best photographed films ever many shots are incredible compositions of form color and light the fight scenes are frequent and very bloody and brutal the blood becomes a part of the color palette gosha uses for his images gorgeous and disturbing while the personal story is simple to follow the historical background is complicated and while a basic history lesson for this time in japan would be very helpful you can struggle through the film without it the few drawbacks to the film are the music track the length and katsu's occasional scenery chewing he has a drunken scene that's way over the top for a film but actually a very accurate depiction of a drunk br br downbeat but one of the great chambara films
<START> what a fun movie if you're a giallo fan red queen kills 7 times is a real winner to begin with it's hard to go wrong with barbara bouchet and marina malfatti in the same giallo both are wonderful especially the wide eyed innocent bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life the kill scenes in red queen kills 7 times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy one of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start the killer the red queen is one of the most over the top and interesting looking murderers i've seen in an italian movie the 70s sets and fashions are wonderful in fact all the visuals are interesting with the laughing red queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film the convoluted plot held my interest throughout finally bruno nicolai's score may be the best i've heard from the composer the main theme is so memorable i haven't been able to get it out of my head for two days br br the only two issues i have with red queen kills 7 times come in the film's finale first the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot if you've seen more than a couple gialli you won't have any problem determining who is behind the killings second the ending feels a little too rushed and as a result is a bit confusing i'm definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me but i'll admit to being at a loss to explain it all a second viewing might just clear this up
<START> shocking br br in 1965 i saw jury gagarin alive he was sincere unpretentious and kindly he was at ease and looked like well educated and intellectual person in this movie i saw a clown the actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and mimicry they made a cartoon the real gagarin was someone else don't believe in this movie br br i saw this movie after the movies like taming of fire and apollo 13 and after reading books rockets and people by chertok and korolev myths and facts by golovanov i was shocked by tiresome scenario poor acting and producing and a lots of inexactitudes of space race br br the movie is the tedious rendering of well known in russia historical facts a lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated some facts and details were perverted for example in 1945 korolev was already not a prisoner liberated in 1944 and in 1940 he was already not in kolyma prison gold mine but in special prison design bureau korolev was the designer in prison design bureau and he was not buried the dead prisoners but in the movie korolev worked as grave digger after 1940 because jailer have shoulder straps on uniform imho the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they can't to make interesting movies
<START> i caught this film at the edinburgh film festival i hadn't heard much about it only that it was a tightly paced thriller shot digitally on a very low budget i was hoping to catch the next big brit flick but i have to say i was severely disappointed this is not a love song follows two criminals who after accidentally shooting and killing a farmer's young daughter become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them down br br the real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a british film the camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story as are the over the top performances and the appalling use of slow motion which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video there are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty which instead come over as hilarious and over the top cue a pathetic obligatory drug scene and countless pointless camera zooms no amount of cliche's such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad story br br we've seen this kind of thing many times before and made a hundred times better particularly in john boorman's masterful deliverance but while in the latter film we actually cared about the characters in this film i found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible even this wouldn't have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile but instead are merely a collection of stereotypical inbred looking countryfolk again another offensive overused cliche' coming to the fore surely there are some nice people in the country filmmakers br br in its defense this is not a love song does contain a couple of good suspenseful moments but it's hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video or at a push getting a very limited cinema release it's not a patch on last year's low budget hunted in the hills movie dog soldiers maybe british cinema could actually get kick started again if the right money stopped going to the wrong people
<START> wow all i can say is that if elizabeth montgomery is the enemy she speaks russian then i'm surrendering right now in her short skirt high top boots and pronounced bust line she's a real babe even if her zombie like eye shadow sort of comes and goes this 30 minutes is no doubt the sexiest of the series note the realistic and revealing wrestling match with bronson until he ungallantly slugs her on the chin ruining all the fun okay probably i should leave off my hormonal response br br this is a very well produced half hour by that underrated force behind the series's success buck houghton naturally the producers want to lead off the third season with an above average entry it's post nuclear holocaust america we know because she's part of the invading force and only american bronson and soviet montgomery are left along with about twenty tons of realistic wreckage they wander among the destruction in alternating moods while we wonder how long it will take for biology to trump politics which of course it eventually does lucky bronson and that's about it no real talk except for what bronson has to say which is pretty overblown nonetheless the screenplay is still entertaining and rather daring for its time even suggesting that not all russian women looked like truck drivers a popular cold war stereotype of the time br br in passing it's rather curious that the very slavic looking bronson buchinsky would be cast as the american and the glossy looking montgomery as the slav appearance wise it should be the reverse my guess is that the producers did not want to cast the american in the physically weaker role of the female regardless of appearances however that may be there is little of the usual tz fright or atmosphere still the episode remains a very very watchable 30 minutes
<START> if you loved pulp fiction and like hand held cameras you should love this film i liked the quirky story even though i feel that pulp fiction was the most over rated movie since the english patient and found the characters unrealistic but interesting it's not on the waterfront or citizen kane and is burdened by european pretentiousness but the worst part by far is the hand held camera it is so distracting and annoying i found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end i don't know why new directors think this method of filming is so great if you are prone to motion sickness stay away the hand held camera will have you nauseous in about 10 minutes
<START> it is a piece of crap not funny at all during the whole movie nothing ever happens i almost fell asleep which in my case happens only if a movie is rally bad that is why it didn't get 1 awful out of 10 but 2 don't be fooled like i was by first review a waste of money and your time spend it on other stuff at this point i'm finished with my review but i have to fill in at least ten lines of text so i will go on ctrl c ctrl v it is a piece of crap not funny at all during the whole movie nothing ever happens i almost fell asleep which in my case happens only if a movie is rally bad that is why it didn't get 1 awful out of 10 but 2 don't be fooled like i was by first review a waste of money and your time spend it on other stuff it is a piece of crap not funny at all during the whole movie nothing ever happens i almost fell asleep which in my case happens only if a movie is rally bad that is why it didn't get 1 awful out of 10 but 2 don't be fooled like i was by first review a waste of money and your time spend it on other stuff
<START> i bet you gene simmons and vincent pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in isn't just too contrived for gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword and big pussy what the hell was that look at me i'm a rat double episode crap all that clichÃ© mafia banter come on the big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit hmm this is not reality but staged drama mark burnett's other show survivor also raised questions for me when johnny fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born br br yuk
