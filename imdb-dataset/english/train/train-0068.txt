<START> still a sucker for pyun's esthetic sense i liked this movie though the unfinished ending was a let down as usual pyun develops a warped sense of humour and kathy long's fights are extremely impressive beautifully photographed this has the feel it was done for the big screen
<START> i really wanted to like this western being a fan of the genre and a fan of buffalo bill wild bill hickok and calamity jane all of whom are in this story add to the mix gary cooper as the lead actor and it sounded great br br the trouble was it wasn't i found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this being bored to death jean arthur's character was somewhat annoying and james ellison just did not look like nor act like buffalo bill cooper wasn't at his best either sounding too wooden this was several years before he hit his prime as an actor br br in a nutshell his western shot blanks head up the pass and watch another oater because most of 'em were far better than this one
<START> this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid chase scenes are uniformly boring and most of the on screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film's last five minutes a briefly glimpsed port a potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film's chief villain no prop is here without a purpose the whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of rodger corman's studio when he'd give a first time director a few bucks and a camera but without the discipline corman would impose
<START> i'll admit that i don't expect much from a roger corman film generally i expect a lot of walking and bad scripts yet in this case i am pleasantly surprised br br the gunslinger is a story of a woman played by the spunky beverly garland who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered ms garland is a pretty good shot herself killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband's funeral her first task is to shut down the local bar that is violating the town curfew the bar's owner is trying to buy land in anticipation of being bought out by the hoped for railroad however ms garland is a thorn in her plans and the bar matron hires a man to kill ms garland br br because of ms garland's plays her role honestly and realistically there is absolutely no temptation to go to suzanne somers she's the sheriff jokes with the exception of a couple of faux pas the apartment door that opens out from the inside jeep tracks and the two horsemen waiting on screen for their cue to ride around a corner the movie becomes quite passable as movie fare however corman could not resist padding his film with horse riding scenes much like he does walking in other films br br sterno says the gunslinger is a horse opera worth your time
<START> in the very first episode of friends which aired 22 sept 1994 the one where monica gets a roommate there is a song playing as rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show the line that plays is if you ever need holding does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song it is seems as if it is a great song i would love to get a copy of it thanks for the assistance i am looking for the album cd it is on so i can purchase it br br i have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again it just seemed to be believable thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years
<START> i was very surprised with this film i was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his marie the little girl he was separated from the humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do actually i was expecting paulie wants a cracker jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room conference so if you wish to see a good animal that talks film check this one out much better than dr dolittle in my opinion paulie also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well
<START> much like orson welles thirty years earlier mike sarne was given the biggest train set in the world to play with but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe despite post modern interpretations purporting somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist tract the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and remains one today how anyone given the resources at mr sarne's disposal could have screwed up so royally remains a closely guarded secret only michael cimino ever came close with the political and artistic armageddon that constitutes heaven's gate both films appeared to be ego trips for their respective directors but at least mr cimino had made one of the great movies of the 1970s before squandering the studio's largesse whereas mr sarne had only the rather fey joanna in his locker furthermore heaven's gate could boast some memorable and well handled set pieces where tragically myra breckinridge s cupboard was bare simply put it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds in the history of hollywood
<START> fair drama love story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new love the acting here is good but the film fails in cinematography screenplay directing and editing the story script is only average at best this film will be enjoyed by fonda and de niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious level it would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy
<START> as soon as i knew keira knighteley being in this flick i said i have to watch this movie she's the undisputed main character domino a bounty hunter her job as the no action scenes would teach us reflects her rebel violent attitude to life i have to admit that it's the very first time that i watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters' hands so this stomped me a bit anyway for all the john woo's fans there are helicopters falling down explosions gunfire as if it would rain and a lovely keira that shoots with two machine guns one per hand the cast is absolutely brilliant going beyond keira which in this movie is a real tomboy pretty much different from the lovely action figure we're used to see mickey rourke is back with his usual slap throwing face and his potent body christopher walken makes his job pretty well as a reality show producer br br let's go to the contents this movie has a journalistic shape the talk show scene is disgustingly real anyone that watched that load of you know what can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations as well as the producer when domino's mom says that the reality that should show domino's life is trash no offense he answers i don't take it like an offense this movie portrays a difficult life domino coming from a world that didn't want her ed mickey rourke a bounty hunter not so bounty choco the third guy of the band which family is using ed's words the correctional institutes he's been and alf the driver bomber coming from afghanistan during the russian occupation this bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born without the shirt unlucky violent and with nothing to lose excepts their as they would consider miserable lives the intro of the movie says that it is inspired by true story more or less so i couldn't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true anyway going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons which could have been added to make the film easier to see and be classified as an action movie the characters' story is too realistic to be edulcorated br br the interaction between the characters is various well studied and definitely not boring what hasn't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist lucy liu sober as never in her acting career it represents only the reason by which domino starts telling her story and that's a story probably the only con in a movie with a lot of pros br br all in all this isn't swat the characters are crafted they have an identity a shape they have a name and a surname not just gamble and street it's the case to say it's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet
<START> cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget br br there are many great laughs even if the story is somewhat thin sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s hollywood comedy style a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience as he makes his exit he assures the client grant that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of 100 00 from the total or at least 50 00 but certainly 25 00 hilarious
<START> motocrossed was fun but it wasn't that great i guess i just didn't understand a lot of the motocross racing lingo and there was a lot of that in the film the plot wasn't what i expected from the disney channel previews so that could account for some of my disappointment
<START> i checked this out as an impulse when browsing through the movie store and couldn't have been any more pleasantly surprised my mom and i watched this film together and we thoroughly enjoyed it it isn't the typical chick flick with a sappy love story and tears all the way through but it definitely touches a nerve in the twist at the end it's an ending where although unexpected and tragic the movie's overall effect is not harmed by it i think reese witherspoon was a great actress even in this film her debut and this is definitely worth watching i didn't recognize many of the supporting actors but they all play their important supporting roles well the man in the moon is such an believable story about a young teenager falling in love for the first time most women can definitely relate to everything from witherspoon's words her subtle glances and her not so subtle emotions raging like the typical teenage girl while she's playing a character confused about love she does not come across as silly and immature which was much appreciated considering many movies today
<START> don't let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this romy schneider classic this movie was shot in a lower budget probably against the will of ernest marishka so he had to make due for example england is portrayed as bordering on germany by a will of the wisp victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to germany by buggy ride alone they arrived their too quick this probably could not be helped but the castle they rented for the movie was austrian when she's told that she's queen she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her where are the british citizens out side from the castle cheering for their new queen why isbn't she showing her self up to the balcony to greet her subjects low budget where the audience back then aware of these imperfection i wonder how the critics felt durring the inn scene she meets prince albert but isbn't excited about it durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear music from famous old american civil war songs like my old kentucky home and old black joe what civil war songs in the 1830's is romy schneider being portrayed as scarlet where's mammy is magna shnieder playing her too is adrian hoven rhett or ashley what was in marishka mind well this add to the camp it's unintentionally satirizing queen victoria'a story this is the only reason you should collect it or see it 03 11 09 correction germany and england are connected
<START> wow saw this last night and i'm still reeling from how good it was every character felt so real although most of them petty selfish a holes and the bizarre story middle aged widow starts shagging her daughter's feckless boyfriend felt utterly convincing top performances all round but hats off to anne reid and our friends in the north's daniel craig the latter coming across as the next david thewlis br br and director roger michell this is as far from notting hill as it's possible to be thank god br br watch this movie
<START> steve carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy first on 'the daily show' and then in various supporting roles in virgin carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths carell plays andy stitzer a middle aged man living a quiet lonely life andy is a little odd but in an awkward nice guy sort of way one night while socializing with his co workers for the first time andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin his co workers david paul rudd jay romany malco and cal seth rogen initially tease andy about his situation but it's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that andy is and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity and so begins andy's quest into adulthood andy is the quintessential innocent and the bulk of the humor derives from his naivetÃ© to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film some of the humor is crude gross out stuff but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy in addition i found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life i'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama it's a rolling in your seats comedy still every good comedy i have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters a good comparison would be 'the wedding crashers' from earlier this summer virgin has a similar humor but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes i particularly loved the ending of the film which i thought was a perfect way to end the flick without giving anything away it reminded me of 'something about mary' very light and fun it leaves you laughing and smiling which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy i would highly recommend
<START> first there is no way the remake can be as good because japanese society is quite different from ours and plays such a major part in this film as explained in the opening narration it adds to the humor as well as warmth of this movie there is slew of different supporting characters personalities each does there part in making this movie wonderful this movie is full of comedy that isn't vulgar in anyway like most of today's gross out comedies yet it can still have you laughing out loud the reality is in real life you don't have a choice of who you work with or go to school with etc this movie truly emphasizes that and shows that the natural good in people can overcome petty differences not to mention it makes for a great sub plot and much of the humor this is a story about dance that actually has a story and a good one at that there are a few back stories that are not out of place but actually support the main storyline truly a well written film the dancing is great too i happen to be a fan of any movie with dancing of any sort for that aspect however this movie goes beyond any other with dance in the fact that it is a story first and just happens to be written about dancing in japanse society highly recommended br br 10 out of 10
<START> before watching this movie i thought this movie will be great as flashpoint because before watching this movie flashpoint was the last jenna jameson and brad armstrong movie i previously watched as far as sexual scenes are concerned i was disappointed i thought sexual scenes of dreamquest will be great as flashpoint sexual scenes but i was disappointed except asia carrera's sexual scene any sexual scene in this movie doesn't make me feel great you know what i mean the great jenna jameson doesn't do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of felecia and stephanie swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned br br although its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor this movie is very good if typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies story acting direction sets makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great the actors of this movie done really good acting they all done a great job dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies
<START> antonioni by making this film had assumed the role of papa smurf to all the little long haired american radical student smurfs he had taken them under the guiding protection of his european communist wings showing appreciation and support for their confused american ways these smurfs are red and wear blue not the other way around the radical smurfs were happy to get the guidance of a wise old man with gray hair who regularly preys to the god of all long haired smurfs lenin the communist another wise old man whose beard made the smurfs take him even more seriously for it symbolized something wise though they did not quite know why they regarded the beard to have this kind of deep effect on them castro another wise bearded man has often profited from this confusion and exuded magical powers with his beard over his naive overseas admirers not to mention che guevara that beard has a certain je ne sais pas quoi about it makes one want to immediately embrace marx and his lovely pacifistic teachingsÂ the film starts with a muddled meeting of radically stupid radical students who engage in dialogues that truly redefine the word confused as confused as a blind folded dog falling of a high story building into a bottomless pit suddenly the movie's hero well antonioni's hero rises up and says something to his pathetic left wing peers and then leaves hoping that this display of mega coolness will improve his james dean image and vastly increase his chances of getting laid with the best chicks in the next mass hippie orgy eventually he gets into trouble with cops i e pigs at a rally and spends the movie under the blue american capitalist skies looking for freedomÂ or something like that br br antonioni's predictable assault on capitalism is not only intellectually hollow but has or had nothing new to offer it's just the same old trigger happy one dimensional cops businessmen discussing business deals and what's wrong with that isn't that how antonioni's movies get made and endless shots of tv commercials and billboards advertising the oh so morally decadent products for the abhorrent selfish and greedy right wing rabble population who thinks of no one but themselves their families their work and their children br br papa smurf antonioni just like his long haired smurfs and smurfettes of the late 60s failed to notice the most obvious and vital aspect about their silly movement they were allowed to have their laughable meetings and express their anti establishment opinions freely within that very establishment whereas the students in those countries whose left wing systems they admired did not and still do not by far the greatest irony about the hippies and antonioni naturally failed to realize this as well his judgment being clouded by cocaine snorting and an excessive intake of lsd is that hippies were are the garbage residue of capitalism this is an incredible irony only in a successfully functioning capitalist system can you find that species called hippie a spoiled ungrateful and selfish bunch of middle and upper middle class losers br br the film itself seems to go on forever antonioni takes his sweet time with getting on with it while including overlong scenes of pointlessness with a high dullness factor his attempts at symbolism are annoying and trite his statements are highly dubious at best this film is antonioni's way of saying that violent revolution is the solution and this is what we get from an old saturated filthy rich fat film maker who lives in villas and dines in the best french and italian restaurants br br i don't remember seeing any major western movie about the tiananmen massacre of thousands of students in china but when one western student gets shot for waving che guevara's face into all our faces we get ten major films about it at once i suppose this means that a chinese life is worth a thousand times less than a western one Â at least to the left wing hypocrites who infest movies br br if you're a marxist neo hippy and disliked this awful review please klick no below
<START> why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie burt reynolds peaked then started making dreadful hal needham car chase flicks arnold schwarzenegger became the hottest property in hollywood only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling last action hero and here loquacious eddie murphy erases memories of trading places and 48 hours with this family adventure flick which is an unbelievably tedious childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see charlotte lewis's great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film br br the story is pure humdrum it concerns social worker murphy contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one chosen for what i hear you ask his job is to rescue a tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world as the main demon classy actor charles dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film but hey i'm sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents of all murphy's films this is easily the worst i've read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see murphy in an atypical role in a non formulaic kind of film and while both points are loosely true there's no forgiving the fact that the film however atypical and non formulaic it might be is an absolute load of garbage br br
<START> facts about national lampoon goes to the movies a k a national lampoon's movie madness br br 1 the movie is poor even by lampoon's typical standards 2 it's not funny 3 no one goes to see a movie br br so after i finished watching it i began wondering why on earth it's called 'national lampoon goes to the movies ' and why it was ever conceived much less actually made it would be like calling austin powers 'an american guy goes to the movies ' how lame he isn't american and he doesn't go to movies none of the characters in lampoon's so called 'satire' are funny and none go see movies which causes a bit of a problem i had hoped it would be something in the vein of mystery science theater 3000 but it isn't br br this was national lampoon's first film after animal house although you couldn't tell it from the quality of film poorly developed rough and amateurish by any standard it induces headaches Â not a good sign for an 89 minute movie that seems double the length br br i've noticed a pattern really bad movies are typically renamed Â and this little disaster falls under that category it has two separate titles probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in 1982 83 'hmm movie madness Â i've never heard of this movie before let's rent it ' and then the realization 'hey wait a minute this is just national lampoon goes to the movies ' br br it was shelved by mgm ua never to be released into theaters or dvd it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade which is just about the only place you'll manage to find it br br it's split up into three stories Â a parody of self enlargement videos butter and corporate ruthlessness and police brutality cop buddy films i guess the first segment stars peter riegert animal house as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff i'm not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift until the sex scene popped up br br part ii is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter don't ask who decides to become queen of the margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products ouch this contains the only funny line in the movie 'only i can make love with my son ' if you think that doesn't sound very funny you're right Â it's not and just imagine Â it's the highlight of this film br br part iii is about a cop who chases down a serial killer christopher lloyd only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy it does contain one funny scene but it's extremely over acted Â only lloyd really exhibits any humor playing his character dry and compassionate yet strangely surreal the part where he's choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watching it all unfold at least evoked a chuckle or two br br it's a shame to watch such a cast of semi famous names resort to low standards the writers of each segment clearly believe that they're being very ironic and clever by spoofing so called stereotypes Â the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction favoring the standard t a instead of plot crude humor instead of witty dialogue desperate performances instead of inspired ones it's easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material muttering their lines often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camera br br the movie isn't funny as i said before i laughed once at only one line and even then it was a halfhearted one two chuckles a smile and a very weak laugh compared to movie madness a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracks br br i like national lampoon's vacation series or at least three of four installments and their classic animal house but their recent slew of direct to video bombs such as golf punks with that great comic genius tom arnold provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago it gets really old really fast br br sad to see a new film called gold diggers is being released with their 'stamp of approval ' it's like condemning a film before it even hits theaters Â maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the placeÂ br br distributor 'this movie is bad it gets the national lampoon stamp of approval that'll teach you not to make something so awful next time ' br br forget the death penalty just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a month br br it's so bad that i can't even begin to explain its putrid vileness i give up
