<START> ulises is a literature teacher that arrives to a coastal town there he will fell in love to martina the most beautiful girl in town they will start a torrid romance which will end in the tragic death of ulises at the sea some years later martina has married to sierra the richest man in town and lives a quiet happy live surrounded by money one day the apparition of ulises will make her passion to rise up and act without thinking the consequences the plot is quite absurd and none of the actors plays a decent part in addition three quarters of the film are sexual acts which still being well filmed are quite tiring as we want to see more development of the story it is just a bad bigas luna's film with lots of sex no argument and stupid characters everywhere
<START> i used to watch this show when i was a little girl although i don't remember much about it i must say that it was a pretty good show also i don't think i've seen every episode however if you ask me it was still a good show i vaguely remember the theme song everyone was ideally cast the costume design was great the performances were top grade too i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i'll be able to see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i don't think i've seen every episode now in conclusion when and if this show is ever brought back on the air i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
<START> i simply love this movie it is a perfect example of the well rounded surprising stories that come out of asian cinema there was a recent hollywood remake of this movie with richard gere and the simply awful jennifer lopez please do not confuse the two movies the original japanese film is touching subtle and wonderfully acted the hollywood version is the exact opposite i was aghast when i first saw the trailer for the remade us version and who was starring in it it's typical hollywood unoriginal crass commercialism at it's worst the remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon the only reason the original film did not become more widely viewed is the us audience's aversion to subtitles br br one of the main reasons this movie would never work in an american telling is that the reserved ultra socially conservative character of the public japanese persona is at issue in this movie certainly the main character awakens to a more full understanding of living a vivacious life through dance but half of the movie's tension comes from the stereotypes and ridicule ballroom dancers face in japan br br please try to see this movie in it's original form not the terrible full screen and please do skip the us remake it's a shallow travesty in comparison to the original japanese movie br br yes i know the original movie is much older and this is simply a japanese take on the story but the only two people are likely to see any time soon are this one and the new us remake br br speaking of foreign films i'll make a few quick recommendations 1 monsoon wedding i list this first for a reason outstanding film 2 johnny stechino very funny italian mistaken identity flic 3 shiri a korean action pic that mixes both asian flare us style plot 4 run lola run a german film that integrates it's techno score ingeniously br br well just a quick list anyway
<START> i would like to comment the series as a great effort the story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well especially in season 1 season 2 however became more of a freak show and lost da's original charm season one story line was more interesting a light side to the life at jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the x series i was looking forward to new seasons in fact i still am i hope the fox guys and da production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait for da to make a comeback even after 2 yrs of it being cancelled da can make it big if worked on properly and i think a name like james cameron should take on this challenge
<START> believe it or not this movie is worse than number three it's slower the acting is worse and the story is very weak there isn't a lot of good to say about this movie even the fight scenes are more dull than number three and i would have thought that impossible this is a very slow 90 minutes painful in fact i stuck it through hoping it would get better if you really want to see this movie you should try to find a cheap rental of it it is hard to find for purchase that is and probably for good reason like number three this movie has nothing to do with the first two it is the same in name only anyway the most i can give best of the best without warning is 2 10
<START> i don't like grade inflation but i just had to give this a 10 i can't think of anything i didn't like about it i saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it i'm sure that the hollywood remake that someone told me about with j lo and richard gear will be excellent but this original japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought provoking for me that i am hard pressed to think of any way that it could be improved or its setting changed to a different culture br br a story i found worth watching and with o fist fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort imagine that br br all the characters seemed well developed even non primary characters had good character development and enjoyable acting and the casting seemed very appropriate br br it's always hard to find a good movie musical in our day and age and perhaps this doesn't quite qualify there is plenty of learning how to dance but no singing but i really think that gene kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man successful with a family in japan looking for something he knows not precisely what br br to the team of people in japan who contributed to this film thank you for creating and doing it
<START> the ballad of django is a meandering mess of a movie this spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes from other and much better films supposedly tied together by django telling how he brought in different outlaws hunt powers john cameron brings nothing to the role of django skip this one unless you just have to have every django movie made and even that may not be a good enough excuse to see this one
<START> i have three comments to make about this film which i discovered hanging out forlornly in a lower shelf at blockbuster first off it is interesting to see the approaches film makers take in trying to film essentially unfilmable works some have as kubrick did with lolita gotten the original author to write a screenplay that is something like the original work of course that can't happen here kraft ebing is long dead some have used the premises of the original work as a launch point to go in a completely new unrelated direction the recent adaptation of tristram shandy comes to mind here you can dumb it down the film of slaughterhouse five is to my mind an example of that or you can simply take the format of the original and try to render it in cinematic vignettes that would be the approach of woody allen's everything you wanted to know about sex and arguably this film upon consideration it is probably the only thing one can do with a scholarly work like psychopathia sexualis the potential loss is that whatever cumulative point the original work had is obscured or destroyed and so it is here br br point two is the cinematic style some would call it an homage to murnau pabst carl dreyer etc but i think it more crude than that its far too heavy handed and self conscious to be effective for long it is eventually just annoying br br point three is perhaps a less intellectual observation how did the people responsible for this manage to make a film about wild sexual deviations and perversion that is so incredibly boring i found the film impossible to pay attention to and anyone who is not automatically drawn to depictions of sexual deviance will find it so as well i don't want to be completely uncharitable and say the film is pointless but i have to say that whatever point the film makers had is rather obscured by the nature of the source material the overt copying of filmic styles and the stubborn refusal to engage the audience on an emotional level possibly for fear of being accused of titillation br br the film is a dubious exercise from the start and doesn't really work for me i'm sorry to say
<START> spinal tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal you saw in jokes all over the place if you know anything about porn this mock documentary will leave you cold everything in it rings false br br spinal tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it over the top this film is decidedly not funny because it paints a picture of how porn is made that bears no relationship to the real world br br the acting here is uniformly awful but that would not matter much if the core idea of the movie were good but it's not
<START> very good point there only an elite few the upper classes would both have access to the internet and be able to communicate on an exclusively english speaking site such as the imdb some might think internet is not reality but this point of view really put media society and democracy at stake you are probably right even if there is internet cafe's in venezuela most chavez supporters will not afford to even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on imdb br br screw you faschist upper class rich right wing capitalist liberal intellectual surpressors probably this is your first time using internet
<START> this is a top finnish film this year although tango kabaree comes close the director lampela made couple of years back another nice little film called rakastin epÃ¤toivoista naista i was in love with a desperate woman joki is truly true to life beautiful film of one saturday afternoon in a little village town the actors are maybe not so handsome or beautiful but they do act beautifully i certainly do hope that many of them get jussi statue finnish oscar next spring i think this film could make it abroad as well
<START> i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his her reluctant guardian i've seen enough of them Â baby boom kolya about a boy mostly martha and to some extent whale rider Â to expect to be bored by the formula what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting small town china in the 1930's extreme poverty was the norm and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market when wang discovers his purchased grandson whom he's nicknamed doggie is a granddaughter he initially casts her out even though she's showed great promise as street performing heir even after he reluctantly takes her back he's not too upset when she's kidnapped the film is gritty then showing the lengths to which a young street smart girl had to go to survive in that society br br the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context in a western society one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status though that i did too while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern suburban child it's completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense br br the peek at small town life in a foreign country the naturalness of the two lead actors the surprising plot twists and of course the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film
<START> a missed train a wrong phone number an extra cup of coffee what happens to those around you when you make a seemingly innocuous decision most people don't give it a thought as they absorbed in their own thoughts and actions br br happenstance tells the story of the interrelations and cause and effect of the mundane as it pertains to a group of normal parisian folk it has all the components of what passes for contemporary theater with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned br br there's a cheating husband an illegal immigrant a classic slacker a pickpocket a crazy grandmother an annoying girlfriend a selfish roommate and a homeless man audrey tautou serves as the erstwhile protagonist in the sense that she's on camera as much as anyone else and opens and closes the film and normal girl who just can't seem to find the right rhythm in her life br br she learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train what her horoscope holds for her what happens to her in the course of the day is told through various characters does the prediction come true the concept is good but the storytelling is flimsy the connections from one event to the next are weak there's better storytelling in 15 seconds of the liberty mutual insurance commercial where one person sees a good deed and passes it along to another than there is in two hours of happenstance br br if you enjoy audrey tautou then you certainly can sacrifice the time for this film but you'll finish it dissatisfied and wondering what this same storyline could be if it were handled by a better producer and director
<START> unfortunately for myself i stumbled onto this show late in it's lifetime i only caught a few episodes about three before it was cancelled by abc i loved the characters and storyline but most of all the great actors i was a fan of sex and the city so i saw two characters i recognized bridget moynahan was the character todd was smith jared as well as jay hernandez from carlito's way rise to power and erika christensen swimfan i enjoy watching young actors get their due and felt like this show would propel their career further along i hope this at least gets put back out on dvd and maybe wb will pick it up for a second season sometime in the meantime i'm viewing it on abc's website from the beginning
<START> after reading some very good reviews about this film i thought i would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film i thought i would give it my own review this is my first ever so bare with me br br first of all i would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me i would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as i wasn't particularly thrilled either the film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times during these times she visits a house which she has been drawing after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality as she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in until she adds her constantly away father to the house due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches br br think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of a nightmare on elm street but is more like a trip to the beach br br in conclusion my generous 3 10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab
<START> this movie was good for it's time if you like eddie murpy this is a must have to add to your collection eddie was young and funny with his 80's haircut charlotte lewis eddie's costar is hot this was one of her first movies and she was not bad the graphics were good for the 80's a lot of the actors went on to do other good movies you should check them out through imdb other must have from eddie is coming to america and 48 hours another actor victor wong has a small part in this movie check out some of his older movies like big trouble in little china if you liked the action movies from the 80's this is your movie
<START> anton newcombe and courtney taylor are friends they both are the leads in their own respective bands anton with the brian jonestown massacre and courtney with the dandy warhols what's interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals its a love hate relationship at times you both hear them praising one another but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are while the dandy warhols went on the reach commercial success bjm still was stuck in the underground scene and for good reason why br br the focus of dig is more towards anton and the bjm as they have a lot more substance they are the most dysfunctional band during gigs they will fight and bash each other anton will hit other members if he feels they aren't performing correctly with the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume fight was always waiting to happen you know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens that's why people would go to their gigs for the fights br br anton is very unstable always thinking himself as a music messiah he wants to change music and create a revolution but he could never get out of the underground he is a very talented musician its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill but his draw back is he cant escape the world he created a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs alcohol and depression on the other side the dandy warhols were having their own troubles they didn't find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label but they found huge success in europe but courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of anton its interesting that both anton and courtney both had what the other needed courtney always wanted to be musically talented as anton though anton wouldn't say it he needed the commercial success that the dandy's had to make his revolution br br over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands there is a lot of footage there is never a dull moment in dig it is constantly moving along as it doesn't have time to slow down as it has to much to say seven years of story telling in the 1h 45mins is a hard job ondi timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more even if you don't like the bands it still deserves viewing it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure br br you wont be disappointed
<START> this movie makes a statement about joseph smith what he stood for and what the lds church believes with all the current media coverage of a certain fugitive people have confused the lds church with the flds church and criminal fugitive warren jeffs jeffs is not associated with the lds church yet media groups internationally have asked for comments about jeffs from the lds church jeffs is not mentioned in the movie at all but i think that it is ironic that this movie with all it's points about joseph also point away from the fews of the flds church and their leader at this time in the media world this is a movie about joseph smith and a great one at that some of the most obvious differences between jeffs and joseph is portrayed in joseph's humanity acceptance and love jeffs views and opinions differ greatly from joseph smith and the lds church and it is seen in this movie jeffs thinks of the negro as devils joseph smith knew they were children of god and gave up his wife's favorite horse to a african american former slave to buy his son's freedom joseph is shown doing housework for his wife emma and is criticized by a member until joseph tells him that a man may lose his wife in the next life if she chooses not to stay with her husband and that doing chores is a way to help and cherish your wife jeffs brought one of his polygamist wives to her knees in front of a class full of students by grabbing her braid and twisting it painfully till she came to her knees lastly joseph participated with law enforcement and sought aid from the government at all times jeffs thumbs his nose at government and flees at all times br br i loved this movie and if you don't know much about joseph smith and what the lds church believes then this is the movie to see and if you had confused the lds church with the flds church then you really need to get your act together we are not much different from anyone who believes in jesus christ the sanctity of marriage and the family as well a patriotic to our homeland and country we are all different as well just like you can find different protestants presbyterians methodist baptist and catholics what's important is our message and what we stand for this movie trys to portray that but there is so much of joseph's life that can't be covered in a mere 2 hour movie this was a really great show
<START> jason bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands trying to make sense of what he's just done meanwhile a cia chief in nyc outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen an american flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot but as he speaks it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security br br this shot effectively captures the mood of the film as well as portraying bourne's quest to find out how he became jason bourne ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security br br it is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year br br it's just so intense bourne says to simon ross considine this isn't some newspaper story this is real and in the audience you almost believe him the camera shakes but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying instead of just being actors performing well written roles the action scenes are so brutally fast paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement the stunt work is nothing short of amazing br br the pacing is just incredible it keeps driving forward towards its conclusion but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set piece while they're often simple the waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them the film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it br br with its intense action set pieces brilliantly paced storyline and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security the bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age ultimatum is its peak
<START> this is an excellent documentary packed with racing action beautiful pictures and a great story the imax cameras give you a very wide perspective as a dvd movie it is perfect your hear every speaker working almost all the time the film is not speeded up and just gives you the natural feel of 230mph of course there are some sound effects added but i think they are good they give a depth to the driving scenes
