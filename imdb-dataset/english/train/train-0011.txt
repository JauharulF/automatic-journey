<START> cedric kahn's films have been character based rather than action based i'm thinking of l'ennui and feux rouges so it is jarring to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some plodding attempts to give character to succo i don't find stefano cassetti to be an interesting actor he reminds me of pro athletes who are coaxed into movies like bret favre that blank stare looks like a really vicious deer caught in the headlights a real actor would have forced us to reflect more on succo's personality rather than admiring his skill at carjacking br br the little acting there is comes mainly from isild le besco as the needy schoolgirl succo takes by storm the interview at the police office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in le besco apart there is little to recommend this film
<START> this movie has recieved horrible ratings from just about everyone who has voted here but i am here to say if you like movies like dude wheres my car and dumb and dumber this movie is for you if your into movies like citizen kane and casablanca id have to sugest you in a different angle yet i still love this movie and everything about it even if it is kind of kiddy this is one of the few movies me and my freinds have been able to keep watching over the years and quote whenever possible great movie this movie should the afis number 1 because its so friggin' high class the only problem with this movie is you may have trouble seeing it because it was a made for tv movie on a channel that no longer exists so i dont know how to get this movie id like to buy it for dvd but i cant find it anywhere i still have it taped from when it was first on you can come over if you want and watch it bute i might be sleeping this movie rocks and thats basicly all you need to know
<START> i was excited to hear that cesar montano had decided to make a movie in the cebuano language not 'dialect' as most filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as as cebuano and tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as french and spanish are to each other but i was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie being a canadian of cebuano parents i was optimistic about the revival of the visayan film industry when i heard about this film i was further excited to hear that it wasn't another stupid action movie or melodrama as filipinos love these types of movies but alas i was short changed br br panaghoy serves as an ego trip for cesar montano montano of course plays the hero of the movie and when i say 'hero' i mean in the most stereotypical of manners his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the bol anons to victory against the japanese his character has no depth or complexity he just fits the hero mold the rest of the characters are one dimensional they all fit their cookie cutter roles br br i'm all for slow moving meditative movies but this movie was just slow moving it didn't really meditate on anything just because a movie is historically themed a drama and slow moving doesn't make it a well made film br br particularly annoying is the american actor philip anthony his performance was embarrassing br br if montano wanted to revive the visayan film industry he should have really thought this through he said he wanted to make visayan movies that could compete at cannes and toronto etc but really this movie would have been booed and hissed at at such festivals to get visayan films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences even if it meant sacrificing quality obviously he didn't think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at cannes so an audience attracting movie would have been at least a foot in the door br br i'm afraid now that visayan movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie if ever i said to a filipino that i want to see more visayan movies of course i'd get an answer like visayans don't make good movies didn't you see panaghoy sa suba of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to see br br an example of movies that are meditative not just slow moving are the tagalog film blackout or david lynch's the straight story i hate to promote the tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of non tagalog filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade i say that blackout is a very good movie these movies rely heavily on what hitchcock called 'pure cinema' images without words are used to convey the story but i bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie and they do it very well panaghoy thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the mood br br and what's with so many filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother
<START> i just watched this movie by mistake what a little gem this film made in 1956 looks and feels like a late seventies movie and is in fact better more restrained and correct than say blue soldier the environmental anthropological undertones are way ahead of its time the understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic much more than dances with wolves the last hunt manages to convey the look and feel of the buffalo killing fields of the late 1800s probably because those in the movie were real killing fields the movie was shot during legal forestry directed buffalo culls so the animals you see are really being shot the bones are real in conclusion a very under rated western masterpiece superbly acted directed and shot
<START> first let's get it out of the way yeah this film steals a lot from 'darkness falls' 2003 the plot for 'darkness falls' goes something like this the tooth fairy a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge in 'the tooth fairy' 2006 the disfigured tooth fairy who yeah hides her face unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone a little too similar to be coincidence br br but what must be asked is this if you're going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie why choose something as mediocre as 'darkness falls' sure it made a few bucks at the box office but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered a low budget straight to video movie will not have that same effect and it didn't br br as i watched the opening 15 20 minutes of the film my expectations actually rose there seemed to be at least some production value the story didn't seem terrible just blatantly ripped off past the first scene we get an okay cast of characters including an ex doctor with secrets played by that guy who looks like a busey and some hot veterinary student jenifer from argento's 'masters of horror jenifer' after those few minutes however the film just slowly goes down the drain it serves all the basic horrible clichÃ©s including but not limited to some crazy old person with an unheeded warning the buff dumb jock the psychic and the stripper with the heart of gold br br one of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with a target audience it's kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time when the adults were on screen it had a more mature feel when star the stripper and whatshisface the jock were on screen the dialogue went down to a more stupid err immature level when the kid was on screen it felt like an episode of 'are you afraid of the dark ' only less scary br br technically the film is all over the place the visuals range from fairly good to plain boring the writing is subpar as is the acting for the most part on the plus side there's some excessive gore at parts including a fairly cool yet painfully predictable woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene also if you're looking for a bit of the sexy stuff there's a brief topless scene but if you want to see this chick topless there are better films to do that other than that there's not much to bother with when it comes to this film br br if you're a huge fan of 'darkness falls' do those exist maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way but that's about the only reason i can find to see this one br br final verdict 3 10 ap3
<START> red eye starts in texas where hotel receptionist lisa reisert rachel mcadams is about to catch the last 'red eye' flight back to miami where she lives works while waiting for her plane lisa meets the handsome charming jackson rippner cillian murphy they both seem to hit it off then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are seated next to each other once the plane takes off they are in the air jackson reveals who he really is that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate the homeland security secretary charles keefe jack scalia they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in miami jackson tells lisa to phone the hotel make it happen or her father will be killed br br directed by wes craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as the last house on the left 1972 a nightmare on elm street 1984 the serpent and the rainbow 1989 the people under the stairs 1991 the scream trilogy of teen slashers a short punchy fast paced little thriller like red eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film craven usually makes the script by carl ellsworth makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that i must admit i really enjoyed at only 85 odd minutes in length it's a very quick moving economical straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots some may like this approach like i did while other's may not but i think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick fast without the film slowing down any giving you a chance to relax i really liked the plot for red eye sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell it's a film made to entertain for me that's what it did i really liked the two central character's lisa comes across as very likable while jackson rippner an obvious play on the name of the notorious victorian serial killer jack the ripper is a suitably slimy villain with a cold 'i'm only doing my job' type mentality another plus point is that i didn't think anyone behaved overly stupid here everyone actually seemed like human beings the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion i really liked this it's one of craven's better more recent films br br craven turns in a good solid tense tight taught fast paced thriller with an attractive cast some good action a gripping plot he certainly doesn't hang about once he starts the action tension he never lets up far away the most effective part of the film is when rippner is holding lisa hostage on the plane once the film switches to miami lisa's fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but it's still good a special mention goes to rachel mcadams who is absolutely gorgeous in this i could probably watch red eye again just because she is in it looks drop dead stunning those who see wes craven's name attached to red eye expecting a horror film should think again since there's no horror in it at all despite the imdb listing 'horror' as red eye's genre i am not sure about the ending on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see lisa kill him in some way br br dreamworks apparently gave red eye an initial budget of 44 000 000 but reduced it to 25 000 000 although it's still a very well made film with glossy production values actually shot in los angeles florida in california the film was supposedly written with husband wife sean penn robin wright penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers opted for younger leads as i have already said rachel mcadams is pure eye candy is a total babe in this worth watching the film for on her own oh she puts in a decent performance too br br red eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that i enjoyed immensely i didn't think i would enjoy it as much as i did i am glad i decided to watch it this definitely gets a recommendation from me rachel mcadams really is hot stuff in this
<START> with the sun shining brilliantly on a quiet sunday that is just about to fully wake up love can be felt in the soft breeze that sweeps past my feet and can be seen in the smiles of the people i walk alongside it is the perfect day to stop off for croissants and a cafÃ© o lait before heading off to the city of lights and love of course a flight to paris is not reasonably in this humble film critic's budget so i had to opt for the next best thing paris je t'aime a collection of 18 short films by a variety of international directors each piece is named after a different parisian neighborhood and is a reflection on love careful not to over glorify the most powerful and persuasive of all human emotions paris je t'aime explores love at the many stages of its own game the results are spontaneously romantic and surprisingly consistent and truly what better way to express the fleeting nature of love and how a moment can change your life than with a collection of filmed moments br br the beautifully poetic quote above is taken from tom tykwer's faubourg saint denis true to form tykwer run lola run uses time lapse photography and repetition to demonstrate the entire cycle of love from inception to dissolution originally shot in 2004 and paired down for this anthology faubourg stars natalie portman as francine an american actress in paris for a part in a film and melchior beslon as thomas a blind man she falls in love with here the blind leads the blind through the most unstable of terrain where two people consume each other to a point where their lives nearly lose their own existences as love seems to go from dazzling to dizzying tykwer reminds us of the tricks it can play on our minds and the illusions it can create when we stray towards doubt br br perhaps the most giddily romantic offering comes from sylvain chomet's tour eiffel choosing the city's most identifiable attraction for its title chomet les triplettes de belleville gives us a little boy who tells the story of how his parents met and fell in love his father a mime paul putner finds himself falling into one surreal scenario after another and eventually lands himself in jail this is where he meets the woman who will become the love of his life yolande moreau miming has become something of a dying art if it isn't already dead yet by nature it is dreamy and untroubled miming points its silent finger at the ridiculousness of human behaviour and what but love can make people act more absurd we might find someone special in the least likely of circumstances if we could just take ourselves a little less seriously br br paris je t'aime keeps the flow lively by not always focusing on love between lovers three memorable shorts focus on the love between a parent and a child walter salles motorcycle diaries has catalina sandino moreno singing lovingly to her child before she leaves him to sing the same song with a distant longing to the child she watches over for her living nobuhiro suwa un couple parfait has juliette binoche trying desperately to overcome the emptiness she feels after losing her son binoche says very little yet not surprisingly given her immense talent her struggle is evident in her face as she learns that love sometimes means letting go and alfonso cuaron children of men weighs in with one continuous shot of a father nick nolte and his grown daughter sara martins walking together for what must be the first time in a long while we see them only from across the street and we only get close to them as the distance between the two characters narrows to a place of comfort and accepting br br the last short to screen is alexander payne's 14ieme arrondissement as usual payne sideways takes an ordinary person and shows us what makes them extraordinary carol margo martindale is another american in paris she is there alone and for less time than she would have liked as she has dogs waiting for her at home she is a plain person with an uneventful life who finds herself in a city that is rich and lush in beautifully delivered americanized french she muses about the sights and how being there makes her feel this woman spends so much time trying to be happy despite life's numerous disappointments and as she sits in a city made for lovers she realizes that she is in fact happy and loves herself more than she knew she falls in love if only for perhaps a moment with life and love itself br br the characters that appear but fleetingly in paris je t'aime find themselves at the romantic center of the universe the moments they share with each other be it helping someone up after a hard fall or reaching out your hand to another person without touching them or without their knowledge are the moments that give love its flare and flourish outside the city of lovers it can be easy to miss moments such as these but we must remind ourselves of their significance it takes but a moment for love to shine through a cloudy sky you just have to keep your heart open to see it and if one city can be so abundant with love one has to believe it can find its way one day to your door
<START> i have a severe problem with this show several actually a simple list will suffice for now i'll go into more depth later on superficial characters a laugh track and boring humour br br if you don't wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior as if you see anything in this show i didn't to a frequently irked teen from canada i'll summarize friends sucks not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the tv audiences for new good shows arrested development dexter etc friends is as much to blame for reality tv two and a half men and the king of queens as the television executives now then on with the review br br these characters have no soul they are exactly the same in every way outside of gender and hair colour they react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it why isn't rachel storming out on monica after monica starts hanging out with rachel's enemy why doesn't joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously oh right cause he's the dumb one and he's comfortable with that this is the curse of having perfect characters lasting conflict and god forbid personality becomes an impossibility br br the laugh track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny how can i make such a broad generalization when a show that claims to be comedy requires laughter from someone besides the audience it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity see the office arrested development br br this leads to my next point the humour is boring there is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous without a laugh track apparently simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws so what if monica dated a 17 year old she immediately recognizes that what she is doing isn't right and breaks up with him there has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him that would be great it would be like a custody battle so now i've provided evidence for my position many of my friends love this show because they haven't heard of curb your enthusiasm or arrested development many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching curb your enthusiasm or arrested development br br i have watched very little of friends in my life but i have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show in my opinion completely unwatchable if you've read this far thank you and i hope you at least start watching some of the shows i have mentioned
<START> i'll be honest with yall i was a junior in high school when this sitcom first aired on abc i didn't think i would like it at all but with john ritter in it i felt that it had a little potential in it plus their was something else with it i liked the acting was great not a lot of horrible 2nd rated comedy lines john ritter always brings his a game when it comes to comedy this was a great show to watch and i'll tell you why it was a great show my father who never watches sitcoms at all he just watches movies sports and law order he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters my mother and myself and watched the show i think because john ritter was in it i honestly think this show would still be running if john ritter god rest his soul i wish he hadn't passed away
<START> i had initially heard of tears of kali a while back and it sounded like something i'd be into but with all the films i have coming in on a regular basis it kinda fell off my radar while roaming around the local wonderbook i spotted the box for this one and grabbed it up i have to say i'm pretty glad i did tears of kali is a strange gory sometimes downright creepy film which is somewhat constrained by it's obviously low budget but is still an entertaining and worthwhile watch br br tears of kali centers around the fictional india based taylor erikkson cult group that practices meditation and other rituals in the pursuit of facing and banishing the individual's inner demons but apparently these techniques work either all too well or not well enough depending on your viewpoint as dark forces are not only exorcised but also unleashed upon hapless victims br br the film is told anthology style with a short but memorable and eye opening intro sequence and then proceeding into the three stories that make up the bulk of the film br br the first shakti is about a journalist who visits one of the cult members who is being held at a mental hospital the journalist goes in under cover of wanting to research the taylor erikkson cult but we find that her true motives may hit a little closer to home when the interview takes a violent turn the journalist finds that she may have gotten in over her head br br the second part devi concerns a violent young man who is sentenced to psychological rehab in lieu of a prison sentence for beating a young man into a coma we find that the treating doctor in question is actually a taylor erikkson alumni and his rehabilitation methods are far from the norm br br the closing story kali revolves around a quack faith healer and his assistant who perform miracles for a fee when the healer unwittingly helps one of his clients and actually expels a force which had been possessing her the demon is now free to roam and looking for a new host br br i gotta say i really enjoyed tears of kali there are some faults with the film that keep it from being truly excellent but it is an original and ambitious film for what it is my biggest gripe with the production is the poor and uninspired over dubbed dialogue the dubbing is sub par and i would have much preferred to have a subtitled option with the original language track some reviewers have said the acting is poor which i don't necessarily agree with i think that the dubbing is so lack luster that it makes the performances seem stunted which isn't really the case in fact a few of the performances are pretty damn chilling the doctor in the second segment and the client in the third readily come to mind and notable the gore fx are very well done for a low budget film with some graphic scenes of eyelid removal via cuticle scissors a pencil in the throat suicide some decent but irritatingly shaky self flaying and a few other goodies thrown in for good measure not as rough as some of the more extreme gore films out there but definitely stronger than your average horror fare i also found the story concerning the cult group to be intriguing and a welcome change to the typical horror story nonsense there are plenty of scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension the likes of which i haven't come across in a while although flawed in some fundamental ways i still think tears of kali will appeal to most underground horror viewers some scenes may prove too much for the more mainstream viewer definitely recommended 8 5 10
<START> i dunno what the hype around this is this is really a bad movie it did nothing to me the only descent scene is where everyone comes together at the party and a nice song is playing uplifting beat and nice cinematic shots that make you move that was the best part of the movie otherwise this film lacks everything to suck the viewer in there's no story there's nothing to think about like some people say there's no cohesion between the different stories it was more of an attempt to re do anderson's 'magnolia' which was brilliant but it fails blatantly okay it's light and easy to watch but that are movieclips too maybe first write a story before you make a movie 4 10 one of the worst belgian movies i've seen
<START> this movie was very very mediocre and very very gory everyone left their acting lessons at home and totally forgot how to act i mean it was so bad and had no real plot and kindergarteners could have written a better story plot wait what story plot not at all scary
<START> so much has been written about the film's plot the wonderful acting performance the script the melancholy bittersweet atmosphere the superb direction what can i add just watch for one of the most heart warming beautifully acted poignant scenes ever filmed it is christmas eve and frank morgan's character the owner of the shop mr matuschek is recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt as each of his employees leave he invites them to a christmas dinner each and everyone of them politely turn him down they all have plans for their own christmas eve at this stage there is a deep sadness to this moving scene frank morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears thankfully we have a happy denouement to this very special scene the new employee the errand boy is the last to exit the shop into a beautiful snowy street scene desperately mr matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would love to spend the evening with him he will treat him to all the wonderful christmas food that this errand boy has probably never seen the chap is overwhelmed he too is obviously as lonely as mr matuschek and together they can have a wonderful christmas meal every time i see this scene it moves me if you manage to get the delightful dvd look at the great trailer with frank morgan introducing himself as mr matuschek and an appearance by the director of the film the talented ernst lubitsch this film is a joy from beginning to end
<START> if you are a fan then you will probably enjoy this if you don't know who misty mundae darian caine ruby larocca or seduction cinema are this is not the movie to start out with it's very cute silly the girls are hot and it's fun to watch there's no sex whatsoever until the very end of the 45 minute film but the score is cheesy trippy and the plot's not a total bore misty mundae's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward braids so she's not as hot in this as she has been in others but her panties in this are quite cute you'll just have to see the movie for that to not sound really weird if you do like this one you will probably enjoy that 70's girl vampire vixens or erotic survivor which is a bit more sexually graphic if you prefer watching misty or esmerelda in less sexual more horror exploitation based but lower budget movies check out the factory 2000 website
<START> it should be against the law not to experience this extremely funny stand up show with eddie murphy i have never seen anything like it br br murphy goes on for almost 70 minutes about dicks pussy tits and insaults so many famous people including his own family among the people who gets it by murphy are elvis mr t michael jackson stevie wonder mick jagger luther vandross and james brown i have seriously never laughed so hard of anything my entire life i mean when a person doesn't know who mr t is but still laughs so hard of murphy as mr t there's something about it at the time i saw the show i couldn't remember who mr t was but still laughed now i know who he is and that just makes it so much more funny because that's what eddie do he can make those impressions so good that it don't matter who the hell he's trying to do it's still hilarious and on top of that we learn that murphy actually is a very good singer please watch it
<START> i watched elephant walk for the first time in about 30 years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior rebecca as others have said you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a larger than life yet deeply flawed relative you have the stern and disapproving servant a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead br br meanwhile elephant walk also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to the letter the bette davis love triangle set on a singapore rubber plantation rather than a sri lankan tea plantation br br maltin gives elephant walk just two stars and imdb readers aren't much kinder but i enjoyed it despite its predictability elizabeth taylor never looked lovelier and peter finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father dana andrews a favorite in laura and the best year of our lives is wasted as elizabeth's frustrated admirer the real star is the bungalow one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history
<START> if only all animation was this great this film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects story and character the characters in this film are beautifully personified i felt for all of the characters and human animal relationship in the movie works perfectly the beautiful animation and 3 d computer animation hasn't worked better in any other film this is a great movie for kids and for adults who want a classic hero's journey 8 of 10
<START> i've seen this film more than once now and there's always someone complaining about the obvious construction of the plot afterwards but then this is part of petzold's game he plays along with the rules of genre br br it's very nice how the highly improbable story of how the two girls timoteo hummer meet is again mirrored in another even more improbable story that the girls make up for a casting this film is a journey between fact and fiction it's more about potentials things that might have happened in the past or might be happening in the future than it is about actual ongoings it's a reverie sorts of so apt enough there are a lot of motives freud might have found interesting for his dream analysis like all the doppelganger constellations br br also i think gespenster might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current asian cinema of the uncanny petzold's everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unobtrusive strangely familiar way this film is not about the obvious to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers or as the story of an orphaned mother who searches europe for her lost daughter clearly doesn't say much about the nature of gespenster at all
<START> second feature concerns a young woman in london desperate for a job happy to accept live in secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son thrillers about people being held in a house against their will always make me a little uneasy i end up feeling like a prisoner too but this rather classy b film is neither lurid nor claustrophobic it's far fetched and unlikely but not uninteresting and our heroine nina foch is quick on her feet rehashing this in 1986 as dead of winter proved not to be wise as the plot elements are not of the modern day julia ross is extremely compact too short at 65 minutes but it stays the course nicely until a too rushed climax which feels a little sloppy from
<START> any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake alex baldwin trying to imitate the late steve mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn't work while baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish mcqueen had charisma never try to compete with a star as for kim in the role of ali mcgraw enough said mcqueen looked dangerous menacing and believable as doc the film had excitement and suspense baldwin and company made this into a comedy i laughed the one and only time i saw this miserable film and that dreadful hairstyle for michael madsen who is one of today's more exciting and believable actors did the makeup people have it in for michael what were they thinking if you wish to see movie making the way it was under sam peckinpah's direction get the original
