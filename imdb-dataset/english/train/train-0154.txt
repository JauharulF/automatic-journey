<START> there is this girl and she's running in the woods but she ends up at this woman's clinic and she wants an abortion her daddy is outside in a van and he is all angry about it the whole episode takes place in and outside of this abortion clinic i'm not really pro choice but i wanted the choice to kill this episode i was laughing when i saw the baby come out and it went into the corner the part where they were doing the ultra sound was pretty funny too i was really feeling sorry for the poor dad in this episode he just wanted to protect his daughter and i couldn't really blame him for what he did i don't know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room i was just laughing too hard and i would suggest watching pick me up instead of this episode it wasn't the worst episode but it wasn't that great
<START> like a lot of series pilots dark angel's opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet not that this is unusual in any way but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was tightened and focused a little more in today's world where something has to catch on instantly or face cancellation the series did itself a bit of a disservice by not coming out at least halfway focused with all guns blazing br br the ninety minute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together and both episodes have a problem with focus in the first half we are introduced to max and filled in on what drives her we also get a few interesting routines with max using her abilities to win bets interacting with a pi or sorting out co workers' domestic problems the problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of genes on television or otherwise br br it's when we hit the second half that we get a story with a purpose and focus throughout the two halves max finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time in the second half the repercussions catch up with him and max reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess this sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series and it works but it doesn't quite click if you get my meaning it's like most of the pieces are there but a couple that make a complete image have been left out perhaps they get filled in with later episodes but that's beside the point the fact is that the contents of this episode could easily have been told with twenty eight less minutes br br the last of the negatives is that a lot of the support cast are totally unendearing original cindy in particular is an annoyance and i doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes while the acting isn't as bad as daytime soap it isn't of such quality that i'd commend it jessica alba is not the worst actor in the world but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it least br br the good news is that the premise and the production values are all top notch in fact this series was considered quite expensive to produce and it is quite unfortunate that it was cancelled in order to be replaced by another show that didn't last a whole season especially when there was ample time for both shows they could have simply cancelled one of the pieces of disingenious garbage they flog under the banner of reality tv the fact is that we need more shows like dark angel where imagination rather than overhype are used to draw the attention br br in all i gave the dark angel pilot a seven out of ten it never rises above the level of throwaway television and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time but the potential is there and that's often all that matters where pilots are concerned
<START> this is short and to the point the story writing used for star trek hidden frontier is surprisingly good acting is all over the map but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at improving their skills it is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will be coming to end mid may 2007 br br i will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics considering this is all volunteer for no profit it is pretty amazing br br if this was being ranked as a professional production i would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets however as a fan based production i have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts this is in a league of its own for sheer volume i don't think this has been matched congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire
<START> thhe remake was a superior movie remake in every way most remakes end up being total garbage but under the very talented direction of alexandre aja became one of the best ever made in terms of remakes and also as far as the mutant inbreed human sub genre of horror is concerned in steps part 2 directed by another individual martin weisz and written by the father and son combo of jonathan and wes i cannot make a good horror movie to save my life anymore craven and if this is any indication of weisz directing skills and young craven's writing skills we are all in for a painful future as thhe 2 not only fails to be as good as the first but also fails to entertain on any level br br we start off with a fairly graphic mutant baby birth which though is rather cool will not prepare you for the utter garbage that is to come only hint to what could have been in this film we then get to see a crew of scientists who all to briefly are introduced and dispatched by our radiated rejects in steps our main cast of army reservist to save the day this is where the major problems begin br br from very sub par acting yes even for this kind of movie to the horrible characters to the lack of true carnage for most of its running time thhe 2 becomes a labor to watch as a lot of nothing happens as idiotic soldiers make mistake after mistake only to meet there demise not by the mutants but themselves think the marines in aliens only the exact opposite and you have the idea of how well these soldiers are trained this is the true shame of the film as most of the hills occupants do not get the kills you would like to see like in the first film in fact if this did not have thhe 2 attachment in the beginning and the brief overview in the beginning tying this loosely to the first this could have nearly been a sci fi channel original br br the mutant mountainbillies as well are not as amusing this time around in fact in a lot of way they are far inferior to our prior batch as they all come off as being rather under designed and uninteresting also the one that took the cake was the sloth like mutant you know sloth from the goonies who helps them out in the 3rd act i was waiting for him to ask for a baby ruth or start going on about rocky road ice cream truly disappointing and shameful is the only way to describe most of the goings on here br br the gore is in the film but not nearly as visceral as the original in fact it seemed toned down for the most part as other than the mutant baby birth scene there really isn't anything that stood out like in the first another major strike against this movie so what did work here the answer is nothing at all this felt like a sequel designed specifically to make money off the success of the first and not to make an actually good film br br i can go on about the crappy drill sgt the radio man that has a speech impediment that's right he is the kind of guy i want radioing in for help in a real crisis or the pacifist fighter that resembles the exact same character mold as our hero in the first film but i believe you get the point this movie is not even in the same league or even the same planet as the first it should have been given another title and been added to the saturday night line up on the sci fi channel a true shame as a solid sequel could have been made but alas it looks like another horror movie that drops the ball on nearly every level and will get one of my lowest scores as i give thhe 2 the same score as its part 2 10 dreadful words cannot describe how bad this movie is a total polar opposite of its predecessor in every way uninspired and down right unnecessary next time guys if your going to make a sequel this bad don't even bother please don't go support this garbage at the theaters save your money and thank me later
<START> i saw mystery men on my birthday in 1999 while i was away on vacation when i came back home i went to see it again keep in mind i was twelve but at that time it was the coolest movie ever i even collected the ultra rare action figures i have them all except for the bowler which is the hardest to find they made mr furious the shoveler the blue raja the spleen and captain amazing in case your wondering there is a william h macy action figure in existence i've watched it many times over the years and it still remains a favorite of mine due mostly to fond childhood memories it's not a perfect movie but it definitely deserves another look and perhaps a cult following br br the story a bunch of low level superheroes save the day this was executed again in the mediocre direct to video the specials as well but this is the other end of the spectrum big budget huge budget almost 100 million i think studio comedy yes the effects are overblown and the huge sets and wonderful production design are a bit much considering the plot but don't think this as a stupid special effects y superhero movie it's a parody they fight a villain named cassanova frankenstein people he has a psychofrakulator whatever that is it's a doomsday device he'll take over the world yada yada and resident superhero captain amazing a zapp brannigan esque greg kinnear with commercial product logos on his costume nice touch is kidnapped time for the mystery men mr furious ben stiller gets mad the shoveller william h macy beats people with shovels the blue raja hank azaria british throws forks the bowler janeane garafolo bowls invisible boy kel mitchell guess what he does the spleen the great paul reubens farts and the sphinx wes studi cuts guns in half with his mind i am not kidding the rest of the fantastic cast of character actors includes geoffrey rush as cassanova lena olin heavily edited out as cassanova's bride and the one and only tom waits as a crazy weapons dealer so with macy kinnear olin and rush there are four oscar nominees and one winner and tom freakin' waits it's not perfect though it's overlong and there are some gushes of corniness here and there the shoveller's full of them br br the dialogue definitely outweighs the physical comedy which is sometimes lacking there's a guy who farts for his power case closed the dialogue is definitely a highlight the cyclical ramblings of the sphinx the mixed metaphors of mr furious etc it's downright a funny movie it will almost make you forget that this was the film that let all star by smashmouth out into the world br br unfortunately the film did not do as well with critics and audiences as it should have a sequel was originally planned the film is in fact based on a comic book and characters from the flaming carrot comics the flaming carrot was planned for the sequel i believe but this did not do well at the box office it could have been a hard sell a superhero comedy with the guy from there's something about mary it also could have been the fact that it was released on the same day as the sixth sense which ended up being the biggest hit for the month of august as well as the thomas crown affair two other misunderstood classics were released on the same crowded weekend oddly enough dick and the iron giant critics gave mm passable reviews but it was quickly forgotten sadly enough on comedy central's roast of jerry stiller comedian jeffrey ross commented to ben stiller that i saw 'mystery men' and i fired my agent ben is then seen to mouth the words i should have to don't listen to him give mystery men a chance
<START> br br burning paradise is a combination of neo shaw brothers action and ringo lam's urban cynicism when one watches the film they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn't matter it's attitude and atmosphere that counts this great film has both always trying to be different than his contemporaries lam gives us to traditional heroes fong sai yuk and hung shi kwan and puts them in a raiders of the lost ark setting however these are not the light hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime there is no holding back too bad they don't make films like this more often
<START> i have looked into the eye of this island and what i saw was beautiful proclaims one of the main characters in abc's award winning television show lost the series could be summarized as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island but that would be doing the show a disservice lost follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island each other and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependency on each other the situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear this isn't an ordinary island either and that they may not be alone br br my initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories they could tell us after a certain period but this proved to be unfounded the narrative flows naturally the dialogue is witty the characters are memorable and the execution is superb the island is a character all on its own and to understand this comment you'd have to see the series for yourself which only goes to show its originality and greatness br br at the time of writing this review only the first two seasons have aired and they're filled with strong episodes my only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit halfway but then fortunately comes back in admirable shape for the final episodes br br if i can recommend one television series you should be following right now it would certainly be this one if you like excitement adventure character driven stories an extremely strong cast and crew beautiful locations and an island that seems more spiritual than natural lost is for you just be sure you start at the beginning
<START> this film is a great example of fine storytelling the acting is superb the story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or fake there were a couple points where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were but considering it is a hollywood movie they showed amazing restraint there wasn't a single explosion shown in the movie even though they had one opportunity to the film while having suspenseful parts was not made into an action movie the story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times well done
<START> the only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money br br i bought it ex rental for Â£3 00 it looked interesting so i took a chance br br within minutes of turning it on i realised i'd made a mistake the entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire where they could meet more of their kind br br as for the devin hamilton writer and director he should just be shot sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish br br avoid this film if you see it in the shops run away br br 1 10
<START> the sopranos was probably the last best show to air in the 90's its sad that its over its was the best show on hbo if not on tv not everything was spelled out for you throughout you had to think it was brilliant the cast was excellent tony james gandolphini is a great actor and played his character excellent as well as the others each character had flaws thats what made them so real and allowed the viewers to connect with them and thats one reason it lasted so long the last episode was good i'm not sure how to take it many different things can be construed by the ending id like to think that tony didn't die but meadow walked in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just for suspense tony will have to go to trial and deal with that hopefully is not dead thats how i feel long live the sopranos and tony soprano
<START> there have been very few films i have not been able to sit through i made it through battle field earth no problem but this this is one of the single worst films ever to be made i understand whoopi goldberg tried to get of acting in it i do not blame her i would feel ashamed to have this on a resume i belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on it's face well it happens here not to mention the sfx look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end halfway through the film i was still looking for a plot i never found one save yourself the trouble of renting this and save 90 minutes of your life
<START> i might not be a huge admirer of the original creepshow but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection and to think i was going into this expecting to like this one more five years after its predecessor george romero gets back on board the ec comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for steve king's three stories though the direction is handed off to michael gornick the film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by gornick but most of the blame would have to go to romero's dreadfully static and unbearably cringe like script especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story moralistic messages that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters simply took over the black humour oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture loosely linking the three tales old chief woodenhead the raft and the hitchhiker together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia 80s animation form i rather liked this segment and the wisecracking creep character was a glowing light br br the first story old chief woodenhead sees two elderly proprietors george kennedy dorothy lamour of a general store in a dying native community dead river get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in hollywood in front of the store is a wooden statue of an indian chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths br br listen to george kennedy waffle and waffle on for 10 minutes about how he's committed to his 'great' community what a nice touchy feely time well just like kennedy's speeches this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise the overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so these two factors really added to my headache when the indian comes alive and turns avenger the goons meet a very quick though grisly death in the proper fashion the effects were commendably done but what about that free flowing hair how could hollywood knock that lock of hair back ugh br br second story the raft follows a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens heading up to a secluded lake after swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake they get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water br br now this is much better much better what starts of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a mysteriously creepy set up that's full of tight and claustrophobic tension and it doesn't even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too the surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it the performances from the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark gornick's direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey side while the alarming music score on this occasion pressed the right chords the sludge like creature in the lake like many have mentioned looks like an icky black tarpaulin yeah you're reading that right floating on the water br br finally number three concludes with the hitchhiker a wealthy but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after being with her male gigolo but she's is running late thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if needed she skids off the road and accidentally hit's a hitchhiker instead of checking or getting help she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband soon enough she's being terrorised by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhiker br br not awful but i really didn't get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead lois chiles was okay in the lead role but that constant assuring and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired the vivid make up effects are well displayed and dripping with vision when she hit's the hitchhiker that's when it becomes hectic cheesy and over the top in its execution from there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeatÂ and repeat the line thanks for the ride lady this happens every time she decides to run over him have a little courtesy for the dead darling br br in all the second short story the raft and the unpleasantly well conceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel
<START> i found the arab conspiracy in a bargain bin and thought i'd uncovered a lost treasure folks there's a reason why you don't hear much about this film the plot is muddy the pacing is slow cornelia sharpe is about as vivacious as plain cold tofu and the ending leaves you flat not even sean connery can save this one
<START> in this movie joe pesci slams dunks a basketball joe pesci br br and being consistent the rest of the script is equally not believable br br pesci is a funny guy which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar but the other roles were pretty bad the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people which wasn't even well played instead of the man being an archetypal villain he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs then there's the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something i don't even remember she was that forgettable br br anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film or at least one of those millions of media minions who can't critique efficiently you know the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6 br br stay away far away and shame on comedy central where i saw this film they usually pick better
<START> parker johnathan schaech is an aspiring writer who is still looking for his big break in the meantime he works as a telephone adviser for a manhattan psychic hotline one day most unfortunately his apartment building burns down parker and his cat make it out alive but are now stuck with the arduous task of finding affordable housing in the big apple word comes to parker that a lady samantha alison eastwood is searching for a roommate but will only accept a gay male since parker is straight but the price is right he decides to pretend that he is gay samantha likes him from the start and welcomes him as her new cohabitant but poor parker sam is lovely intelligent and very desirable how will he be able to keep his true nature under control besides doesn't sam have a successful businessman boyfriend anyway this is a sweet likable and humorous film with two very attractive stars in eastwood and schaech naturally the plot is a string of how can i keep up this ruse scenes with sam asking parker for shampoo while she is showering or pleading with him to hold her in bed when she receives bad news also it is necessary for parker to produce his own fake gay mate boris when sam insists upon fixing him up with a man she knows hopefully the gay community will not find this too offensive as this viewer thought most issues were treated with sensitivity and subtlety for a small scale movie the costumes sets and camera work were quite nice also therefore if you love those funny tales of love get this one soon you will like what you see i know it
<START> let me start by saying at the young age of 34 i was suddenly widowed i was devastated as he was not sick he died unexpectedly basically of a coronary his carotids blew out he died behind our house there was a lot of speculation from police cause he fell on something and it bashed his head in i was a suspect for murder until the autopsy came back br br my children were as traumatized as i was so in love with a good father figure as he i had three small children no education no financial support i took it very very hard br br within two years my in laws attacked me verbally physically emotionally and spiritually demanding i grieve not in front of the children and put on masks and showed people what they wanted to see not show them my pain during holidays nobody stood up for me and my choice to sit out one holiday except of course the grief therapist i was seeing that had advised me to follow my heart and soul my in laws didn't get it it changed forever my relationship with them and i have never been back for a holiday this is only one example of how my grief was disrespected my own new husband has seen me fall apart talking about the trauma when i shared from my soul i collapse can not breathe hyperventilate and generally am defunct for a few days if i even try to convey the hidden pain br br now about this movie br br today my soul was stirred my heart broken my fears and pain re surfaced from the real demons this movie presents how one grieves compared to how others expect us too and the demons within adam sandler portrayed perfectly the horrendous agony you face overcome and most of all work through on your own time this movie dredged up all the pain that i have tried over the years to deal with you see when something harms your soul so profoundly so deep that utterances are all that come from your mouth in moments of thinking you can not deal with it without wishing you were dead and walking through life in a dead state br br the bible has a scripture romans 8 26 that i have clung to that when my mouth and soul know not what to pray for that god's holy spirit carries that agony to the feet of god i need not speak sandler portrayed that to perfection br br there is a scene where he has been hauled into a court hearing for mental health commitment purposes and he goes back in to face his in laws familiar to me and he tells them the stunning truths that he has been possessed by per se that he can't get over it's a profoundly strong and mighty performance i started bawling and had a hard time after wards getting up to walk out from the theater feeling my legs too weak to do so my son was with me and saw it first hand my precise motions while trying to hold it all together a lesson for him my youngest who barely remembers his daddy it's been 13 years for me but this movie brought me back to the moment of losing my in laws forever when they demanded a mask on my emotions and my surrendering to their desires instead of respect to my own br br i write this so that if you are a griever you are prepared for this movie but recommend it highly in the 1000 star performance sandler gave br br if you are not yet a griever please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their grief letting them find peace in their own time sometimes the soul can not utter the words to convey our pain br br go see this movie with tissues and not without preparing to take it in to your soul
<START> it's refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily just like almost every other american movie and then be surprised when that doesn't happen i like a happy ending as much as the next guy but sometimes it's better to portray things in a more realistic manner and i thought brokedown palace did this very well br br the ending with one friend basically sacrificing herself for the other thus redeeming her earlier poor behavior which got them into the situation in the first place was very moving i almost rather would have done without the last line which proved that she didn't actually do the deed she confessed to because that would have made the movie more about the friendship between the two girls and less about the crime whether she did it or not wasn't that important br br the story itself bordered on the clichÃ© but the actresses kept my attention with their excellent performances very realistic very captivating br br 7 out of 10
<START> what a terrible film br br it starts well with the title sequence but that's about as good as it gets br br the movie is something about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing spree the acting isn't so much poor but the script is pointless and the film isn't even scary despite the atmospheric music br br it really is amazing that some group cobbled together this bag of rubbish and thought it would make a good film br br it isn't a good film it's trash and i urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it one out of ten
<START> yeah it's low budget yeah it's one of candy's earliest films but it is maybe his funniest john candy was not so far removed from his sctv days in going berserk and it shows if you don't crack up when candy tries to help a guy with his groceries while being hand cuffed to an escaped cohort in the process of having sex with his girlfriend with only the apartment door separating them huh see the movie or the way euguene levy the creator of kong fu yu is talking to his mom on the phone or just the countless number of facial expressions that only candy could deliver you better check your pulse if you like the john candy of only the lonely this is may not be a movie i would advise you to see but if you enjoy the sctv days of john candy this movie is a must see
<START> definitely one of my favourite movies the story is good acting is great all technicals especially cinematography are sharp and the script is clever br br heath ledger is terrific as edward ''ned'' kelly he is gripping as the legendary outlaw and is supported well by geoffrey rush naomi watts and orlando bloom all action sequences are on point br br the film is edge of your seat stuff right up to to the end one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in and makes no mistake here br br an excellent film all round
