<START> i could write a big enough comment on any one of the characters in gundam wing they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts instead we get 8 great leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of anime bliss br br it contains dialogue that you can roll around in your head for months years and then go back to and derive new meaning from a masterpiece in script writing even though it has the typical anime trait of there being a disparity between subtitles and english dub it has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views br br the relationships between the cold unfeeling males and loving female characters is a stand alone aspect of this series the relationship between heero and relena and milliardo and noin are joys to watch the apparent rejection of the male is underpinned with an inner turmoil that makes the love a word never mentioned in the series of the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment the women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely if at all see which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic it takes heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring but he gets there and when he does its a big pay off br br and then there's the giant robot fighting fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any hollywood epic fight scene any less clued up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon function for kids as has become clear when i'm trying to recommend this series to my friends but they're wrong many of the giant robot fights in gundam wing contain a hefty dose of pathos usually concerning young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society making their beliefs obsolete br br the constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode makes gundam wing impossible to be boring it is a captivating thought provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body
<START> i feel this is one of the best movies i've seen i'm an older male and love most westerns i love movies based in part at least on facts if i am not mistaken this is such a movie i also like revenge type movies this qualifies there as well in my opinion some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and the barn shooting scene i felt the corral beating scene was a little overkill but did not affect how i feel about the complete movie i saw what i think is a continuation of this movie in a gun smoke episode i also enjoyed that i recommend taking the time to watch this movie i will watch it again i also felt the romance parts of this movie were well played i thought it was so out of character for randy travis to play a villain type but i always enjoy his acting
<START> once in a while you get amazed over how bad a film can be and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap there is absolutely no talent included in this film from a crappy script to a crappy story to crappy acting amazing
<START> actually that video camera effect is just that it's an effect a rather good one u don't know much about directing a film do you this film is in fact better than the original it's great fun to watch made for tv doesn't need to follow any rules i find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl its disturbing and all the time we are routing for judd nelson to get away with it we as the viewers are on his side i hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but i doubt it watching this film you can understand how real movies are made as this is sort of like a film within a film judd is one of the scariest villains ever and he's more realistic he doesn't just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors
<START> this is essentially a variation on house of wax in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies vincent price in both pictures he plays a talented artist who is sent toppling over the edge into insanity when his creations are usurped by other less talented and less scrupulous people in this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist the great rinaldo john emery insists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designs price is already ill disposed towards rinaldi as his former wife is now a paramour of rinaldi he deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon rinaldi and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designer br br price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man whose predicament earns audience sympathy the rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on price who carries the burden with ease br br good solid b movie melodrama this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you don't expect a masterpiece shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance
<START> one of the few best films of all time the change from black and white to colour for the heaven and earth sequences was directorial excellence br br the plot is extremely clever the complete film leaves you overwhelmed by all of the human emotions and although a war film it doesn't discriminate i must have seen this film more times than any other and i never tire of it it is a film that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs on what happens after our demise
<START> excellent show instead of watching the same old sitcom type shows where it's the same old thing just different stars this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining view of office situations we have been away from watching any television for 2 years and after coming back of all the shows available we look forward to watching this show on w shame on global for pulling the plug on this one i thought this one would be a winner let's be realistic about things few canadian shows make it everyone i talk to enjoys this show and i believe it was foolish of global to walk away i guess they want to stick it out with the typical mind numbing shows from the states instead of pulling behind a canadian made show that had a lot of promise don't get me wrong i enjoy a lot of shows on tv but come on people let's keep the variety this unique show provided a very comedic view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships with unique characters that you don't see on any sitcoms today or in the past too bad that global had to say no to this one foolish mistake
<START> on the eighth day god created georges but the same as an eighth day doesn't fit into the week georges doesn't fit into the modern world he has down syndrome and is therefore marginalized by society shunted off to an asylum after his mother's death four years ago she was the only one who loved him br br harry is another man that isn't loved anymore his wife has left him for reasons that she is unable to explain he loses the love of his daughters too when he arrives too late at the railway station to collect the two kids who wanted to spend the weekend with their father br br harry is a highly ranked businessman he knows all the rules that enable us to succeed in our modern meritocracy but he has entered a state of crisis which reaches a climax after the loss of the love of his daughters he questions the sense of his life without obtaining any definite results br br harry and georges meet at first harry tries to get rid of georges the same as all the others do but georges can't be shaken off and it gradually dawns on harry how much he needs georges if he wants to get over his identity crisis it is georges who opens a new access to the world for him and who makes him view his life with different eyes friendship and human warmth take the place of calculating striving for success it is no surprise that harry now cannot avoid failing in his job br br georges helps harry to regain the recognition of the daughters even his wife has to admit that the fireworks which he organized were worth seeing nonetheless a reintegration into the old life is no longer possible and the new one turns out to be nothing more than a dream with a time limit which unstoppably will reach its end the camera watches harry and georges from above for one long minute as they are both lying down in the grass just savoring the moment but the same as this minute will unavoidably go by the friendship of the two men which came into being in such a wondrous fashion will not be long lasting georges is destroyed by the impossibility of love to the opposite sex and can see no other way out but to commit suicide harry turns into a city tramp who asks the car drivers that are waiting in front of the traffic lights for charity br br the movie describes modern meritocracy as a disastrous mechanism which devours positive values such as human warmheartedness or friendship it is georges the mongol who seems to be capable of showing the way out of the dilemma but unfortunately his plea comes to a bad end however his failure does not necessarily have to mean that it is impossible or not desirable to reach the aspired goal the way he shows us is surely passable although it requires a huge amount of willpower and above all the courage to apply a radical nonconformism
<START> normally i'm not the sort to be scared by horror movies but this movie is the exception some how this movie got into my mind it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout another seen was the family photo i wasn't expecting that and i jumped out my seat i would recommend everyone to see this movie with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time
<START> sondra locke stinks in this film but then she was an awful 'actress' anyway unfortunately she drags everyone else including then real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer it's an exceptionally weak story basically no story or plot at all add in bored poor acting even from the normally good eastwood there's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers wow could a film be any more boring i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun a real stinker don't bother with this one
<START> bob clampett's 'porky's poor fish' is a so so cartoon populated by appalling puns and one or two nice moments set in porky's fish shoppe 'porky's poor fish' occupies an uncomfortable area between a standard black 'n' white porky cartoon and one of the books come to life merrie melodies that were popular at that time typically of many of the early porky cartoons porky is far from the star appearing only in a rather stilted opening musical number and the climax of the film for the rest of the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but gets more than he bargained for unfortunately the audience gets far less than they bargained for as was sometimes the case in the books come to life series the spotlight is thrown on punning signs which could have worked just as well in a non animated medium laughs are scarce and while the cartoon is just about saved by clampett's energetic direction there is very little at all to recommend 'porky's poor fish' over any of the other below par early porky cartoons
<START> no hidden agenda pure scifi all fun br br i saw the original on tv and was scared pretty bad i was a kid br br the original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which i saw and have forgotten the original one starring the great movie star steve mcqueen bullet is by far the better and only version anyone should see br br the movie production is dated but the fx used to make the blob stands up the test of time i was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord 10 10 br br zafoid
<START> first i'll give my rating for the series overall 7 out of ten stars i've taken away three for the downhill slide this series suffered after john amos departed don't get me wrong there were hard hitting episodes later but only after esther rolle left for a season and returned br br in february of 1974 a really great sit com with dramatic overtones premiered on cbs it was a tv first a show about an african american family living in the chicago projects in the 1970s created by norman lear as a spin off of maude he once again struck the right chord with viewers br br not since this show have i seen a situation comedy directly talk about the struggles of inner city families well there was fox's south central in '94 but was not renewed br br john amos as james evans sr was the ultimate father figure for this family and acted as any father should to keep his family together and his kids from going down the wrong paths in life br br esther rolle was a wonderful no non sense mother figure who was on the same page as her husband when it came to their kids upbringing br br ralph carter as michael a young but very bright young man for his age but stuck in a school system that doesn't meet his academic needs his character's name is the same as the show's founder mike evans who was lionel jefferson on the jeffersons mike evans passed away dec 2006 br br thelma is a young girl of 16 or 17 and has to deal with the dangers of being a young woman in the streets of the ghetto jimmie walker as j j evans jr is the typical young wise cracking jiving kind of young man who does not take life seriously enough br br simply put all my favorite episodes are with john amos with the exception of the penny gordon janet jackson story lines br br after the demise of the james evans character the show lost it's stability and viewers departed esther rolle left for an entire year not wanting to play second fiddle to jj's smart aleck dyno mite's br br she returned the next season after securing a guarantee that the writer's would even things out florida's neighbor wilona woods was a divorced woman who ended up adopting an abused little girl penny gordon played by a then 10 year old janet jackson penny's abusive mother was played by totie fields kim fields' mother br br in august of 1979 the show came to an end with all leaving the projects for a better life jj the artist had sold an idea to a comic book company michael went off to live on campus at college br br wilona penny thelma football player husband keith florida all moved into the same building in uptown chicago not the most realistic ending but by that time it didn't matter
<START> nb spoilers within this great movie is about so many things all of them successfully sci fi time travel unstable psychologies dystopian society the what is real syndrome gradual undermining of belief systems worldwide bioterrorism and a nascent love story br br the ramifications of the story's twisted time line stir up loads of heated debate witness the discussions within this site or as an extreme check out the dissertation at www mjyoung net time monkeys html whew such temporal emphasis speaks mostly to the brilliant plot coming from the magnificent work of writers david and janet peoples not to mention the inspiration of chris marker's la jetee without a doubt this is one of the most successful fascinating time travel movies ever conceived but there are many other levels speaking here br br the movie's real genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time travel in the mind of james cole bruce willis doing the best work of his career here his journey progresses from gung ho vaccine hunting warrior to gradually unhinged victim Â and back again the other broad sweep of the story increasingly emphasizes the personal tale between james and dr kathryn railly the wonderful madeleine stowe i love the simultaneous shifting opposing viewpoints of these two characters for me it all comes to a head in the fleabag hotel room scene by this point james Â once gripped by an unshakable determination Â now slumps in utter doubt about his own reality while dr railly Â the cool and rational scientist Â has finally become wildly convinced after absorbing james's proofs of his horrific predictions her desperation to get through to james and hang on to the mission shows how far she's come br br gilliam makes us care about these characters especially through the crescendo of tension threading their lives the balance held between emotional roller coaster and mounting sci fi puzzle thriller is exquisite and the denouement at the airport is heart poundingly intense because we see it coming so clearly through james's dreams it is here just after james has decided to quit the whole mess Â and is fighting his insanity more than ever Â that he steps back up to the plate and does what is necessary for mankind see jose and the gunÂ just before this the references to hitchcock's vertigo and identity switching confusion are brilliant this is a movie to be hashed out between thinking people it not only holds up under repeated viewings it demands them twelve monkeys is intelligent provocative bizarre funny and suspenseful stuff br br the supporting cast is excellent especially brad pitt stealing all of his scenes and showing great flexibility as jeffery goines crazed and spoiled but ever the survivor and there is david morse as dr peters interesting how the movie simply leaves to the viewer his wicked motivation and christopher plummer as dr goines but the biggest accolades belong to terry gilliam surpassing here just barely his outstanding brazil lots of parallels of course especially the lonely combatant trying to escape his crumbling surroundings lunacy within lunacy without every frame of this movie has his unique stamp and tone the soundtrack is terrific too br br this is one of the great achievements of the 90s a true favorite of mine and sure to hold up for a long time to come
<START> this is a really cool movie i remember first seeing it when i was really young and i used to watch it all the time like once a week shadow was my favorite character in the movie homeward bound is really funny and its really cool how they train the animals to do all those things parts of the movie are sad though such as when sassy the cat falls down the waterfall and when shadow falls in the hole at the end i have seen the second homeward bound but i gotta say its not as good as the first shadow is the smart one sassy is well sassy and chance is the funny idiot i recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies or talking animals this is one of my top ten favorite movies
<START> a girl is showering unknowing that a serial rapist is staring at her through the skylight detectives martin manners and orville stone is hot on his trail but not hot enough as they find him after he kills rapes and eats a nipple of the girl he's the shot to death one would hope that this would be the end of the film not because it's too horrifying but because the level of acting is atrociously horrid sadly it's not the end and months later the rapist is resurrected as a zombie by a coven of satanists so he continues where he left off with the detectives on the case again this time a flying baby is after him too don't ask there has been very good very low budget movies street trash and filthy mcnasty spring to mind but this one is scraping the bottom of the barrel horrible acting crappy dime store special effects lame attempt at comedy and oh yeah and the ending sucks too br br my grade f br br eye candy theresa bestul gets fully nude anne r key gets topless
<START> ok the helicopter shots are fantastic and the director made good use of some of barcelona's top sights otherwise production value was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week ellen pompeo was charming and fun to watch abel folk had the most depth and was very effective and william baldwin was well william baldwin he got to put his martial art training to good use and be a running jumping earnest action figure the rest of the cast was wooden at best but mostly paper so if you're nostalgic about spain it's a picture postcard with an action twist and a healthy dose of el greco if not skip it
<START> okay i had heard little about this film so when it came on the movie channels on tv i wanted to watch it being a horror aficionado i think i can do a collective huh for everyone who watched it br br i decided to move on with my life but at a party with my closest friends we saw it was coming on and some of us having seen it already decided we could laugh our way through it both of us proclaiming this is the dumbest thing i've ever seen it wasn't scary ill give it to roth who i think is a young hack characters do change throughout the film ala cube br br however despite your typical rats in a cage scenario who will turn on who etc it was pretty average horror br br a few points 1 what was with that kid i'm not even talking about him being weird and biting people i'm talking about the whole slow motion karate kicking what was that 2 okay i know rider's character liked jordan ladd's but as a young woman i was appalled that he just went ahead and molested her in her sleep uh thats illegal br br 3 roth was in the movie just so roth could be in the movie talk about pointlessly writing yourself in 4 what was with the deputy 5 so she was just instantly pulled apart by the dog and there was little to no blood left just a scrap of her jeans anyway we were laughing our asses off and i love laughing during horror movies return of the living dead 2 evil dead but i don't know if we were supposed to be laughing here
<START> i can't quite say that jerry springer ringmaster is the worst film i have ever seen the film would be better off if it were because at least the worst film i've ever seen prom night ii interested me enough for me to hate it my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed it had seemed much more like years it is an endless repetition of poor people or what jerry springer seems to believe poor people are screwing each other hitting each other insulting each other and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing the plot which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the jerry springer mill advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters this makes it impossible to care what happens to them it never mattered to me whether they got on the show or what they said or who slept with whom maybe i'm not supposed to care about them maybe i'm supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny too bad it isn't the humor is not outrageous it's innocuous it's predictable humor has to have something behind it some kind of painful irony or life experience in order to function scatology is not wit an example a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughter's boyfriend since i was over the shock of jerry springer's show a long time ago i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clay's obscene nursery rhymes not laughter just yawning lastly i found springer's pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing if he really were an advocate of the poor he would bring on a single mom from bed sty to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on 12 000 a year or failing that he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits jerry springer gets millions for his shows his movie his book and videos his guests just get round trip air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to humiliate themselves if he liked poor people so much he'd give them at least some of the money they earn for him it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself jeez with all his fine work you'd think he'd have earned our respect already anyway the film is weak and boring it doesn't even succeed at being offensive if you want to have a better evening videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that
<START> normally i try to avoid sci fi movies as much as i can because this just isn't a genre that really appeals to me light sabers ufo's aliens time traveling most of the time it's nothing for me however there is one movie in the genre that i'll always give a place in my list of top movies and that's this twelve monkeys i remember to be completely blown away by it the first time but even now after having it seen several times already i'm still one of its biggest fans every time i see it this movie seems to get better and better br br somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996 leaving only 1 percent of the population alive james cole is one of them he's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a 'volunteer' to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic they believe it was spread by a mysterious group called 'the twelve monkeys' and need the virus before it mutated so that scientists can study it but their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990 where he meets dr kathryn railly a psychiatrist and jeffrey goines the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert br br what i like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not is this just an illusion created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time was the population really wiped out by a virus released by the army of the twelve monkeys those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end if the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious i'm sure that i would never have liked it as much as i did now it's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time but that's not the only good thing about this movie of course the acting is amazing too normally i'm not too much a fan of bruce willis but what he did in this movie was just astonishing together with madeleine stowe and brad pitt he should have won several awards for it because together with the amazing story they made this movie work so incredibly well br br even after several viewings i'm still a huge fan of this movie except for this movie i have only seen one other terry gilliam movie and that's fear and loathing in las vegas which wasn't bad but didn't really convince me either however it's this movie that really makes me look forward to his other work i give it a 9 10 maybe even a 9 5 10
