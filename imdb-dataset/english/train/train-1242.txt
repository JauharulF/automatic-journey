<START> road to perdition can be summed up by thomas newman's score it's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to newman's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of scent of a woman meeting joe black and the shawshank redemption you're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen as the sullivans drive round america trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of the getaway irish gangsters is miller's crossing whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by coppola and leone's gangster epics despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn't be taken as a heavy criticism of sam mendes film which i repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and i was slightly confused as the events that caused michael sullivan to be betrayed but if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director mendes is br br road to perdition is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances i've never been all that keen on tom hanks but he's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role probably better paul newman plays a character with an irish accent but at no point did i believe i was watching an american screen legend putting on a false accent newman's performance works due to the subtle body language his character is torn up by guilt but newman never milks it or goes over the top while never upstaging newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two brit supporting actors craig and law are also very memorable as american gangsters and while law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how daniel craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn't decided to become james bond a role which heralds the end of an actors career
<START> i watched this movie and the original carlitos way back to back the difference between the two is disgusting now i know that people are going to say that the prequel was made on a small budget but that never had anything to do with a bad script now maybe it's just me but i always thought that a prequel was made to go set up the other movie starring key characters and maybe filling in a bit about life that we didn't know rise to power is just a movie that has carlito's name there should have been at least a few characters from the original movie the ending makes no sense in relation to the original in the end of this movie he retires with his sweet heart but how the hell do we get him coming out of prison in the next movie and his woman isn't even the same woman that he talks about as his only love in the original i would say the movie is mildly entertaining in its self with a few decent bits but it pales when held up to it's big brother don't lay awake at night waiting to see this watch the original one more time if you really need a hit
<START> spoilers included br br with a title like bleed you know the creative juices weren't running on high when this puppy was conceived the movie is your basic run of the mill low budget slasher movie oh sure it tries to be creative with the premise of the murder club but we learn that was just a joke anyways okay for those who really care about these things the basic plot is that new girl in town starts dating her co worker he invites her into his circle of friends and at a party they tell her how they have a murder club and they murder people blah blah blah well we learn that it was all a joke but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage now the members of the murder club are being killed one by one oh and the bad guys wins and the movie ends on a downer by that time you won't really care though br br in retrospect the first 10 or so minutes of this movie make no sense the motivation for the killings in the beginning of the movie is never explained i would say that it was a way for the director to pad out the film but on the dvd there are deleted scenes i'm not sure why anyone would want to see more than the feature length version of bleed but apparently the people behind the dvd thought the viewers would be clamoring for more on the box it says there are easter eggs but why the hell i would want to waste my time looking for extras on this movie is beyond me br br i was expecting a bad movie and bleed delivered on that front it wasn't a fun bad movie though everyone looks good in the movie and there's plenty of nudity but the acting is just awful my least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer i think he's supposed to be funny and amusing but he just ends up coming off as a tool i think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage in a hilariously unconvincing death heroine shoves the women into the parking garage cement pole and the woman looks like she barely hits the thing and she spits out a mouthful of blood and dies br br for those who think that movie making is an intricate creative process done by professionals check out bleed it will change your mind and you'll realize any hack get can a movie made br br otherwise don't waste your time or money on this
<START> this film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of sex in the city and four weddings and a funeral in fact if they'd called it sex at a funeral they might have done better at the box office br br but the film falls between two stools and can't get up the characters spout improbably bright dialog but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human one arbitrary senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprise br br andie macdowell gets points for acting her little heart out but the performing honors are stolen by imelda staunton as of all things a police detective don't they have a height requirement over there ms staunton seems unable to make a false move would that we could say the same about the writer director br br if notting hill annoyed you as being bogus stay away from this one phonus bolognus on the half shell
<START> this has to be the worst movie i have seen madsen fans don't be drawn into this like i was he is only in it for a maximum of five minutes this movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest of the movies on earth as well as t v had been destroyed
<START> in the year 1985 my birth year steven spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young african american girl celie debut role for whoopi goldberg whose life is followed through rough times the story begins from the year 1909 when celie is only 14 years old she has given birth two children for her father celie has a younger sister nettie with whom she is inseparable a widower lays his eyes on nettie but their father gives celie to him it is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling women are inferior of men and especially being an african american woman their rights are less than a zero celie's story is a true survival story br br the color purple is a master piece and underestimated film of spielberg he should make more drama which the color purple and schindler's list are good notion br br the cast is amazing whoopi goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama danny glover was surprisingly nasty mister i have never seen him in a such an evil role the talk show icon oprah winfrey is brilliant as a strong willed sofia br br warning prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film you can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like i have with my sister br br big applauds to mr spielberg
<START> i've never really considered myself much of student when it comes to watching films i watch them form an opinion and that's it but unhinged changed all this this film is without a doubt the most inept attempt at film making i've ever seen every kid who rocks up at university thinking they're gonna be the next spielberg or tarantino needs to be handed this film with a handbook titled how not to make a film not only is there no story to be had the film makers weren't even competent enough to make a film worth watching it's been a while since i saw it but all i can say is watch the overhead tracking shots in the opening scenes they are never ending it's almost like having your teeth pulled only not as much fun
<START> the movie was a huge disappointment especially since it was directed by priyadarshan it was sad to see such dismal standards poor screenplay almost non existent and song sequences with bad songs every minute and at the most odd times killed whatever humor the movie could offer some of the scenes were funny but it amounted to probably only 5 mins of the whole duration the editing was pathetic dismal overall the movie disappointed as the lack of story was only too evident in fact only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the interval br br one wouldn't miss anything at all if you don't watch the movie not worth spending valuable ticket money on this movie wait till it appears on tv
<START> nothing 3 outta 5 stars another weird premise from the director of the movie cube this time around there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void there is literally nothing outside of their small two story house intriguing to be sure but i thought the comedic tone established for this movie from the get go was extremely ill conceived there needs to be some humour certainly and i have no problem with the humour that was eventually derived from the plight of our two heroes their final showdown was definitely a hoot but i really think the movie would have been a lot better off if it had stayed more rooted in reality in the beginning after watching the movie i watched the making of feature on the dvd and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the sillier comedic aspects making it look like a completely different and slightly better movie the last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together similar in a way to the recent movie primer the actors are fine when they are not overdoing the comedy shtick they are really quite believable in their more normal moments i was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the midway point but it won me over by the end and keep watching past the credits for the final scene just don't ask me to explain it
<START> every time i watch this movie i am more impressed by the whole production i have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made everyone involved is perfect script acting direction sets and editing whilst james stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance and the supporting cast are magnificent it is margaret sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take breathtaking
<START> i enjoyed the movie very much emotionally intellectually and visually it contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects and doesn't need them one bit holding my attention the entire time with the visuals story and interspersed words of wisdom br br however 1 some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear understand 2 there is unnecessary overuse of swearing especially the f word which is the only reason this movie was rated r 3 the movie is balanced with humor and emotion but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film except the final resolution last minutes is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long 4 i will not recommend this movie because of 5 seconds of background narration which did not add one bit to the side character it applied to or the film it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward the main character's mother of german ancestry when watching old wwii movies secretly roots for the germans there would be no local color or art if the nazi's won the war i don't know of any germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the nazi's won wwii
<START> hi i consider just cause one of my favorite sean connery's movies it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the cast especially connery it also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies so the dialog is pretty good in this one it also has one of the best scenes in movies ever when sean interviews ed harris's character in prison is just fantastic i enjoyed this one a lot and i can not recommend this enough really do not miss this one do not pay attention to the negative reviews stating that the last 30 minutes suck it was as intense as the rest of the movie i really find just cause a very entertaining movie
<START> i cannot say this movie is a disappointment because i read some reviews before watching and it did not do as well as i thought it would have the bar was not set that high so the fact that my expectations were met is not saying much br br the good the city of new york if you live in the city like me you'll recognize certain places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than just a setting rather one of the main characters there are genuinely tender moments humorous conversations and plot twists left and right which all keep things interesting br br the bad the first thing i thought after leaving the theater was that i wanted more but not in the positive leave them wanting more fashion certainly the good skits scenes outweigh the bad but there are a lot of skits that fall within the in between category too many in fact which is what ultimately brings the movie down also new york city's diversity though hinted at though the many distant pans of the city and mentioned in conversation throughout the movie is never really realized or analyzed to the point of doing the city justice for example many of the skits involve well to do middle aged whites i mean i know the city is home to many of the said demographic but come on paris je'taime's plot and character diversity makes new york city look like lancaster pa or someplace really white it is just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its heritage like that br br still even after having said this i would recommend giving new york i love you a view who knows maybe you'll disagree with my opinion and maybe you won't you will never know until you see it for yourself this review is not meant to deter anyone from watching this movie as everyone's opinion on art differs i'm just giving you a very vague heads up on what to expect
<START> i saw the long day's dying when it first came out at the cinema i thought the film gave a good soldiers point of view it gave a realistic account of men at war the storyline moves at a nice pace showing a group of men behind enemy lines and trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner the characters are well developed and believable br br david hemmings is a good actor and plays the leading role with conviction as does alan dobie as german helmut i was surprised that i have been unable to find this film on vhs or dvd and i feel it has become the forgotten film which is sad as it is superior to many other war films i have seen
<START> 'capital city' fans rejoice this first season of this series is now available from network dvd and i've recently got my copy although very much an ensemble piece of key 'maverick' trading floor characters 'capital city' does present us with various moments through both its first and second season when each member of the team plays a significant part in a particular central or peripheral plot line the cultural mix english irish american german polish of head trader wendy foley's played by joanna phillips lane group of staff is balanced with their own distinctive mannerisms interests and personalities which helps to make the rather unfamiliar and to most people seemingly sterile subject of financial trading reasonably engaging through the engaging performances of the cast in fact this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather staid and old fashioned senior management of shane longman as represented by lee wolf richard le parmentier and james farrell denys hawthorne i suspect that such an unconventional way of working as employed by wendy's team would not have become a reality had it not been for youthful reclusive 'free spirit' peter longman inheriting his thirty per cent stock in the company from his father and allowed a more trendy relaxed modern way of business become a reality to a certain degree wendy's i am led to believe immediate supervisor leonard ansen john bowe follows the establishment in the traditional manner of running the company however his fondness for wendy rather sees him occupying the 'middle ground' on most occasions the main interest in the series i believe stems from the simmering romantic attraction between douglas hodge's declan and the cool self assured blonde haired german trader michelle hauptmann played by trevyn mcdowell which had viewers continually wondering if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendship fondness that they undoubted have br br looking forward to browsing through this title and hopefully the second season of thirteen won't be too far away
<START> yowza if anyone who loves laurel and hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it you're a better person than me this movie while a great attempt at 'imitating' laurel and hardy through appearance sound and routine falls very short of honoring them or even being a movie of any substance i blame larry harmon dialogue is torn from old l h movies and planted in unrealistically the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co stars pinchot's accent was bizarre for stan and while sartain did an excellent job with ollie's accent he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was mr hardy where was a good musical number editing is choppy acting is stiff lines are horrid physics are implausable although perhaps they were trying to give it that feel of cheap sets and overall it's a terrible thing to witness it's even more painful to watch than atoll k where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950's era writing and photography do yourself a favor and watch as much of the original laurel and hardy films as you can and learn how things were you know what a magnate is don't you stan laurel did not perpetually reply with semi moronic quips at every sentence br br i pity anyone who thinks that this was a decent update honor of the boys where was the classic theme song why ruin 'here's another fine mess' why skip 'any the wiser' why was there a pointless gaggle of co stars why miss gulch from the wizard of oz why must larry harmon be in it why bozo and did the learning channel help fund the thing br br i mean really fart jokes for god's sake br br fart jokes
<START> this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen without a doubt the only thing interesting in this film is the cameo appearances from some great genre directors and king himself the film has a great premise but falls apart about 15 minutes into the story i did like madchen amick in this film and think she could have a very good career in film
<START> another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved children tale la bete 1975 aka the beast tries to imagine in very graphic and what may seem offensive and disturbing but in reality rather silly and comical way what actually happened between beauty and the beast i am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this movie i would not go so far as saying that it is a serious and dark exploration of such subjects as sexual frustration longing fulfillment or satirical criticizing of the catholic religion i would not even call it a horror erotic movie it's more of the parody on all genres it touches or mentions even though it's got some shocking moments in all departments that sure will stay in your memory br br the long way too long scene between an aristocratic young woman and the supposedly horrifying but the most laughable i've ever seen in the movies creature with truly impressive well anatomy is set to the clavichord music of scarlatti and is hysterical my husband and i both laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the encounter the moral of the scene is beauty can and will defeat the monster the question is who is the target audience for the film for an erotic picture it is too verbose for an art movie it's got too many jaw dropping scenes of sheer madness and i'd say an abrupt ending imo the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama as a parody of art house horror erotica it is funny and certainly original have a good laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning this story of the curious beauties and the lustful beasts certainly is not recommended for co viewing with the children the opening scene that may shock an unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of bestiality can be successfully used on discovery channel for the program like in the world of animals mating habits and rituals of horses
<START> shecky is a god damned legend make no mistake until recently i worked for a uk hifi video retail chain running their testing department we would go through many new starters they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores now to tortu test the resolve of these new staff members we would issue them with a copy of going overboard we had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of goodmans dvd player that had this film as a free gift got round to sending their dvd player back they never failed to send shecky back also our new staff would be forced to use only going overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with br br now as to why this film is so bad where do i begin br br adam sandler who can be so so very funny as in happy gilmore or the wedding singer must have been having one hell of an off day the rest of the crew stank and what is it with billy zane his name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time and he is a decent actor crazy the production quality is absolute zero br br i would have been inclined to give this a zero if i could because they didn't even have the guts to call it by it's full name 'the unsinkable shecky moskowitz' on release even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far sandler has come and just how low he can go
<START> elvis presley plays a half breed native american indian who has to defend his reservation from nasty business tycoons everyone likes to get drunk fight and make children fighting wrestling and punching out each other replace the stereotypical hand raised expression how br br although he does have make up on it's obvious elvis is healthier than he appeared in prior films possibly he was getting ready for his famous comeback it couldn't have been because this movie's script was anything to get excited about joan blondell trying to seduce elvis and burgess meredith in war paint should be ashamed br br the best song is stay away actually green sleeves with different lyrics the most embarrassing song is elvis' love song to the bull dominic there are some surreal scenes but it never becomes trippy enough to succeed in that genre though stay away joe might provide some laughs if you're in the right mood br br otherwise stay away br br stay away joe 1968 peter tewksbury elvis presley burgess meredith joan blondell
