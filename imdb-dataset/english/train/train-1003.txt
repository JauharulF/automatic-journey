<START> when i saw it for the first time i was really impressed the director made such a mysterious atmosphere especially in the end through all the story spectators can expect that richard will really kill thomas or he will do it first but the main point was not conflict but friendship older and mature one prayed himself to save the younger who has the whole life to life it is amazing every time i watch it i enjoy of course it is pretty violent like every action movie but i think it is acceptable thanks a lot louis liosa and tom berenger amazing film i advice everyone to see it i am sure people wont regret and will really have a good time
<START> this was a delightful presentation hemo blood as a greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity arrogance snobbish superiority and innocent wonder the quote or scene i recall vividly is when hemo tires of all this plumbing you haven't learned my secrets at all and threatens to storm out the scientist answers him in a single word thalassa salt water which horrifies the fiction writer but mollifies hemo and segues so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood br br such a splendid blend of entertainment and information make this a classic as fresh and engrossing today as the day it was released stimulating the interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching kids to love learning
<START> i am normally a spike lee fan it takes some time to really get into his mojo but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart lee is a genius unlike the 25th hour or bamboozled two of my favorite films of his there was no clear story in this film i was able to understand the struggle between washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others but for some odd reason lee was never able to get the true feeling out washington did a decent job with what was handed to him but you could tell that this was not lee's favorite film not only did lee direct this film but he also wrote it you could tell the camera work was horrid and the writing only contributed to the decay of the film this film was coming full circle and it wasn't going to be pretty lee was not 100 behind this film as he was with do the right thing of all the films i have seen lee direct this was the brightest and more modest of his films it was almost as if he created a hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own i don't know if he saw the money from do the right thing and ran with it or what Â but this film did not demonstrate his true talent br br for anyone out there that has seen this film and perhaps stopped watching anything directed by spike lee afterwards due to this film i suggest you give him a second chance don't get me wrong i see exactly where you are coming from with this film and why you would want to put this behind you but lee does grow up his work becomes more of his own and you can see the transformation from a desire to make money to just wanting to make good films it took me awhile to watch the 25th hour but when i did it was sheer brilliance perhaps it was the actors perhaps the story but lee crafted an amazing film out of one man's journey into the unknown i guess that is what i was hoping mo' better blues would turn out to be this really dark journey into the life of a man that really never grew up but instead all i got was denzel being denzel he really is one of the most versatile actors of this generation and i do consider him the sydney poitier of cinema but this was not the film to showcase his talent br br another issue that i had with this film was the use of spike's sister playing one of the love interests i don't know about you and your family but i do not think that i could have filmed a sex scene with my sister i don't care who the actor is or how much money i am getting paid i would never do it it is just something that i never wish to see but apparently that is different for spike he went ahead and showed the full nude image of his sister without any remorse it was sad and it even made me blush also i need somebody to answer me this what was flavor flav doing introducing this film so i am sitting there on my couch ready to start the film when suddenly there is a voice from the past spelling out the studio that made this film then he acknowledges himself that did not build for a strong remaining of the story again i felt that lee was going for money on this film instead of actual talent perhaps that is how he could afford both denzel and wesley in the same movie without any explosions br br there were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end don't get me wrong this was a very bad movie but there is always a diamond in every alleyway the scene when bleek accidentally forgets which woman he is with was mesmerizing he continually went back and forth weaving truth to confusion in a way that proved that lee was actually behind the camera it was a visionary scene that was probably lost in the shuffle due to the remaining poor scenes the other scene that was worth watching was the way that lee introduced and ended the film by keeping the same pacing and direction he was able to bring this tragic character around full circle and give him the chance to change his life other than these two moments the rest of the film was pure rubbish not worth viewing unless you are about to go blind br br grade out of
<START> this is an interesting treatment of a subject that is quite controversial just read the other comments on this film apparently you either love it or hate it and it seems most people make that distinction based on whether they believe the tribulation and end times will happen as portrayed in the movie br br basically the film and its sequels were made for about 1 30 each the production values are right down there with plan 9 from outer space and the acting is about on the same level as glen or glenda my apologies to ed wood putting aside the religious message the story is as scary as they come add in even the slightest thought that the story might actually be close to something that might happen in the future and it becomes even scarier br br this movie and its sequels didn't try to bring in the reasons why the tribulation happened when it did left behind and the omega code tried to get in everything thief did and to explain all the politics and maneuvering in the middle east leading up to it the net effect was thief did a much better job on the scary part of movie instead of spreading itself too thin trying to explain what was happening in the middle east at the same time br br forget the politics and watch this movie and its sequels for what they are horror stories that they may be horror stories told indirectly by god makes them just that much more frightening if it makes you think about the subject it has done its job even if you never believe
<START> this documentary makes you travel all around the globe it contains rare and stunning sequels from the wilderness it shows you how diversified and how fragile our planet can be the polar bear's future is highlighted at the beginning and at the end of it after all its bleak future is closely linked with the consequences of global warming this documentary is however a simplistic approach of such a serious environmental issue it can nonetheless be easily seen by young children since it mainly remains descriptive scientists might well be disappointed as it is not a remake of al gore's documentary an inconvenient truth but frankly what a description a question may then arise isn't it worth preserving our world's beauty because this documentary proves that in 2007 such a beauty still exists despite the different pollutions by living in towns and cities we tend to forget that we are part and parcel of this nature all things considered this documentary reminds us that we own a common treasure called earth
<START> considering its pedigree this should be a far more enjoyable film than it is even with a lip smacking collection of eccentrics in the cast what aficionado would not eagerly anticipate a movie which brings together lemmon lanchester kovacs and gingold the entire event is dully paced drearily shot and more often than not witless br br kim novak's gifts were not essentially comic as she went on to confirm in kiss me stupid james stewart was a fine comedian as he ably demonstrated in movies from ranging from the philadelphia story to harvey i think he comes out better from this mess than anyone else does except maybe the cat
<START> this film actually works from a fairly original idea i've never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway however the way that it executes this idea isn't original in the slightest we follow a bunch of kids that for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest the fact that the forest is inhabited by these nymphs make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by rednecks nutcases zombies etc but really the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme many films of this ilk don't have a single good idea and it would seem that this one has worn its brain cells out with just that one the only real asset that the monsters bring to the table is the fact that they're beautiful women that the characters lust for rather than being hideous grotesques that they want to run away from this is good up until a point but it soon gets boring and the almost complete lack of any back story surrounding the central monsters ensures that the film is never going get itself out of the 'horror trash' category br br it's been years since the evil dead made the woodlands a prime horror location and in spite of films like the blair witch project it still makes for an excellent horror setting this is one of the film's major assets as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown the only problem is that forest of the damned doesn't ever seem to have much up its sleeve the death sequences show a distinct lack of imagination and the fact that all the characters are clichÃ©d in the extreme doesn't help as you're more likely to be looking forward to seeing them get killed rather than hoping they can get away the cast is made up of kids mainly but there is a role here for tom savini who unfortunately doesn't get to have fun in the special effects department the only real highlight the film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves the naked ladies tend to look great and if it wasn't for them this film would get very boring very quickly there's nothing to recommend this film for really but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks you might find some enjoyment here
<START> it seems evident from this adaptation that he did not not only did he leave the plot behind he made up his own the things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously unbelievable that i was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel the plot was hazy inconsistent and choppy to say the least i don't want to say anything mean spirited about the actors but they can't act dickens is difficult of course but this is pathetic micawber was nothing more than a mid nineteenth century kramer and the less said about betsy trotwood the better if you want to see the real copperfield watch the wonderful 1999 bbc adaptation as for the screenplay writer i think he read the cliff's notes
<START> being a genre film fan a child of the 80's and a fan of hard rock music this movie holds a special place in my heart it has everything you could want in a supernatural movie action great special effects for 1986 and a guitar wailing glam rock soundtrack it certainly was the movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time i didn't see this at the cinema because it was never released theatrically over here but it's popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured it's cult status and eventually led to a sadly mediocre dvd release in 2002 if you're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably isn't your cup of tea but trust me there are worse films of this type out there and despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations trick or treat is most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare you'll never look at your stereo the same way again or should i say mp3 player br br trick or treat trivia marc price eddie played geeky skippy handelman on the popular long running comedy sitcom 'family ties ' after a string of direct to video flops including 'little devils''killer tomatoes eat france' and 'the rescue' he gave up on acting to pursue a career in stand up comedy recently he has been considering a tv comeback br br glen morgan roger is now a major hollywood producer screenwriter he has written and produced several major films and tv series including 'space above and beyond''the x files''final destination''jet li's the one''willard' and most recently 'final destination 3' br br tony fields sammi started his performing career as a dancer on the tv series 'solid gold' he appeared in several low budget films and tv shows before landing his breakout role as the devilish sammi curr in 'trick or treat' sadly tony passed away on february 27th 1995 of aids related cancer br br doug savant tim is probably best remembered for his pioneering role of homosexual twentysomething matt fielding on the popular sitcom 'melrose place' since then he has had a long and varied acting career appearing in such films and tv series as 'the one''godzilla''csi crime scene investigation' and the short lived joss whedon sci fi series 'firefly' currently he can be seen as tom scavo on the smash hit series 'desperate housewives'
<START> i'm not usually one to slate a film i try to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones but in this case there are almost no good points in my opinion if you're going to make something that bad why bother part of the film is take up with shots of anne's face while she breaths deeply and violin music plays in the background the other part is filled with poor and wooden acting rupert penry jones is expressionless jennifer higham plays anne's younger sister with modern mannerisms anne is portrayed as being meek and self effacing which is fine at the beginning but she stays the same all through the film and you see no reason for captain wentworth to fall in love with her overall the production lacks any sense of period with too many mistakes to be overlooked such as running out of the concert kissing in the street running about in the streets with no hat on why was this scene in the film at all the scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written to sum it up a terrible film very disappointing
<START> five years on from the tenko survivors returning home and from marion's double edged well that's that br br it's now 1950 reunion time the gang's all here marion bea ulrica kate dorothy christina dominica and latecomers maggie and alice the story that unfolds is a beaut as perfectly written and acted and as thought provoking and moving as the original series br br all the questions left hanging at the end of the series are neatly answered here from marion's family to joss's health centre everything has changed in five years and not everything has changed for the best br br a trip to dominica's plantation brings plenty of shocks and some truly edge of the seat tension there's a real sense of tragedy and disaster as once again fate takes over and the women struggle for their lives dominica finally shows her true colours and there are some shout at the telly moments of drama br br lush location filming in singapore and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends it's such a shame that this really is the end i could watch it all over again perfection
<START> is rich ailing elizabeth taylor courting the angel of death on her island fortress in the mediterranean or is she just overreacting or more precisely overacting as usual actually both are applicable in director joseph losey's wandering meandering mess called boom appropriately titled since tempers in the lush luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode richard burton climbs taylor's mountain uninvited she dresses him in a samurai's robe complete with saber though great looking in widescreen the picture is otherwise quite deadly a failure even liz 'n dick philes should shun the stars' collective what the hell attitude to their late '60s film careers reached an ego mad nadir here pointless confused and maddening boom is a catastrophe although screenwriter tennessee williams who adapted his own unsuccessful play the milk train doesn't stop here anymore was said to be quite fond of it from
<START> i saw this movie when it was released and my distaste for it has stuck with me all these years br br here's why br br greenaway's goal seems to be to take every literary image in the tempest and make it literal if a character were to say my heart takes flight we'd be shown an actual human heart with pigeon wings attached flapping across the screen br br this process makes for some lush tableaux but ultimately it's a facile exercise and it becomes deadly boring br br i don't begrudge the pleasure other viewers found in this movie but it's worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was enraptured
<START> when i first saw this show i thought it looked interesting i watched it saw how it revolved around sarah like the character sees the world revolving around her i got it but wasn't laughing very much br br onstage and in her show she's racist crude insensitive and hugely self centered i didn't get her at first and took it all at face value then i got to see her movie jesus is magic i think that served as a sarah silverman primer for me explaining to me just what 'language' she's speaking she's like marilyn manson working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images but you eventually realise it isn't an assault it's a statement and once you understand that you find you're glad someone's finally giving it to you straight br br i don't mean to suggest only smart people will understand or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy while i like a lot of 'smart' shows i still to this day do not see the humor of curb your enthusiasm i get the impression that it's good but i just don't get it many people will never get the sarah silverman program but i'm glad i eventually came around br br the creators of this show do work hard every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot but with songs or dream sequences production numbers these people aren't putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together if i was to predict the future of this show i'd say it will go the way of arrested development and freaks geeks it will get canceled before it's time and live on in fans' hearts and on dvd but take heart ssp creators your audience is out there and we'll be watching for as long as they let you make the show
<START> the lion king is without a doubt my favorite disney movie of all time so i figured maybe i should give the sequels a chance and i did lion king 1 1 2 was pretty good and had it's good laughs and fun with timon and pumba only problem i feel sometimes no explanations are needed because they can create plot holes and just the feeling of wanting your own explanation well i would highly recommend this movie for lion king fans or just a night with the family it's a fun flick with the same laughs and lovable characters as the first so hopefully i'll get the same with the third installment to the lion king series sit back and just think hakuna matata it means no worries br br 8 10
<START> watching david bathsheba is a much better way of getting your bible lesson that going to sunday school despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining the studio system had its faults but it spared no expense when a lavish production was called for peck portrays king david as a lusty but tormented poet who commits what is tantamount to murder to bed a sexy bathsheba susan hayward raymond massey as the prophet nathan delivers his usual saturnine and ferocious performance look for the silent screen star francis x bushman as king saul and a young gwen verdon as a dancer hooray for the old testament and hollywood
<START> i remember parker posey on as the world turns before she became the queen of the independent movies in this film posey shows her potential as a top fledged actress in this film with supporting cast that includes omar townsend as moustafa a lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel salesman on the street who aspires to become a teacher the supporting cast features a wonderful actress who plays her godmother and only family relative as judy the librarian who is old fashioned dedicated and menopausal posey as mary learns that she has to grow up and mature losing her librarian clerk position makes her realize how much she misses it as a place in her life mary's life is surrounded by friends in the lower east side village of new york city before it became gentrified with yuppies this film is quite good for an independent and i have come to enjoy parker posey as mary as well as other characters in other films
<START> yesterday was earth day april 22 2009 in the us and other countries and i went to see the full feature movie version of earth by disneynature i guess like the auto manufacturers disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet maybe they really do care about the planet i don't know but i don't think it warrants a special unit with the word nature in it i do know that my youngest daughter loves mickey mouse and who am i to tell a one year old my personal feelings about disney br br aside from incredible cinematography it was a typical disney disappointment for me preceded by a half dozen disney movie trailers rife with disney clichÃ© circle of life falling with style over dramatic music recycled footage disney claims 40 new footage i was even starting to think that james earl jones narration is getting a bit boring i like james earl jones but his work for disney and morgan freeman doing every warner brothers narrative starts to wear thin i really think that disney bought some bbc nature photography that was so spectacularly done they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognizable sound bites on it br br and what is disney's obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals there were a half dozen such scenes complete with bleating youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out i think disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the action movie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents i was also cognizant of how disney stopped well short of implying that man had anything to do with the climate change are they so afraid of the tiny minority of deniers that they think it's still a controversial subject br br i recommend skipping this one and renting the blue planet dvds on netflix nature films seem to be best done by the british at the moment
<START> this movie had some andrenaline kickers but it's an old story that simply could never happen navy protocols could never break down that much that a crew much less an xo could ever go that far against the captain i'll take dr strangelove any day if i wish to see this plot sidenote the us navy did not support this film
<START> it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball br br likewise an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema the presence of a radio in just about everyone's house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world's events and provided many a drama and especially comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality br br the literature of the time also flourished at all levels the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures but the comic book just did not magically appear all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages all by itself there were mediums that were ancestral to them obviously the newspaper comic strip was one parent providing the visual narrative method of story telling br br the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine the inexpensive prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going though not necessarily serialized tales the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough's tarzan and johnston mcculley's zorro the 1930's brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow the avenger g8's battle aces and the spider master of men all found their way to the news stands among many others br br one other was doc savage a full blooded super hero of the written story the covers of the pulps had perhaps the only picture of the hero possessing extraordinary strength super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect doc was the prototype super hero br br he also assembled 5 of his former army buddies into a small free lancing team of adventurers each of them was an expert in a given field so we had a top rated chemist lawyer construction engineer electrical engineer geologist archaeologist paleontologist etc br br the doc savage stories were very popular in the 1930's and '40's and were published into the middle '50's then they went into a hiatus for a good 12 15 years then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container the paperback book a fresh look to the cover art was introduced featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc with a perpetually ripped shirt br br the re introduction proved to be highly successful with the publication of a title a month and for a while more soon there was a rumor of a doc savage movie but when by what producer well the venerable man of bronze was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together it was veteran stop action animator and producer of top special effects films geoprge pal who did the film along with warner brothers br br when doc savage man of bronze arrived in the movie houses it boasted of a well casted team of actors albeit a largely no name as far familiarity with the viewers with former tarzan of tv ron ely's nearly perfect casting in the lead up and coming beauty of a starlette pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler as the villainous captain seas no other name would have been recognized and just maybe that was a plus in this case br br the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going use of narration by paul frees and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story br br from the very start there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured camp humor as the batman tv series some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected unlikely outcomes for example an experiment of doc's with a miniature rocket missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish a small one at that the whole story unfolds like that hitting the viewer with a little 'camp' every so often as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously we are also puzzled about mr george pal's being the producer his last he who had been so well known for special effects surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci fi action setting of the pulp character's world br br i can remember seeing it quite vividly mrs ryan deanna was in the hospital just having given birth to our 2nd child michelle 08 14 75 our older girl jennifer was visiting her grandmother so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward it was straight over to the old marquette theatre 63rd kedzie here in chicago br br having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc i was sort of let down by the final product i could accept a little of this 'camp' business but would not have objected if mr pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp comic serial type excitement br br and yet the cast headed up by mr ely and the others made the whole film likable if not lovable the sets and locations were as far as we can see very much like those of a '30's serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone br br and maybe that's just what they were trying for with this doc savage man of bronze
