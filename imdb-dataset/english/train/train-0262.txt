<START> in iran the islamic revolution has shaped all parts of life including everyday things but people still go on living their lives generally just doing the things you'd expect like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it's in the running to qualify for the world cup except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game br br a frequently funny little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium the absurdity of the situation the simple wish of these women to cheer on the team nothing subversive there and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a fine comment on humanity versus the ideology br br amateurish acting good script and dialogue a really enjoyable film bend it like beckham sort of a warm heart and a joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people
<START> hold your man finds jean harlow working class girl from brooklyn falling for con man clark gable and getting in all kinds of trouble the film starts out as his film but by the time it's over the emphasis definitely switches to her character br br the film opens with gable pulling a street con game with partner garry owen and the mark yelling for the cops as he's being chased gable ducks into harlow's apartment and being he's such a charming fellow she shields him br br before long she's involved with him and unfortunately with his rackets gable harlow and owen try pulling a badger game on a drunken paul hurst but then gable won't go through with it of course when hurst realizes it was a con he's still sore and gets belligerent and gable has to punch him out but then he winds up dead outside harlow's apartment and that platinum blond hair makes her easy to identify she goes up on an accomplice to manslaughter br br the rest of the film is her's and her adjustment to prison life her interaction with the other female prisoners give her some very good scenes i think some of the material was later used for the mgm classic caged br br harlow also gets to do the title song and it's done as torch style ballad very popular back in those days she talk sings it in the manner of sophie tucker and quite well br br gable is well cast as the con man who develops a conscience a part he'd play often most notably in my favorite gable film honky tonk br br still it's harlow who gets to shine in this film i think it's one of the best she did at mgm her fans should not miss it
<START> words fail me br br and that isn't common br br done properly this could have been great funny spoof b movie sci fi but sadly it was not to be rarely in the field of drama have so many competent actors struggled so vainly with such a dogs breakfast of a script i can only endorse the previous reviewer's comments go clean the bathroom in fact do anything except watch this film br br positives lucy beeman's nose negatives everything else br br most apposite line this isn't going anywhere br br if only every plastic surgeon could meet with such a fate
<START> i thought that this film was very well made heath leger was very convincing and his irish accent was flawless orlando bloom and naomi watts were also really good and believable how true it is to what really happened i have no idea but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over 30 000 signed a petition for ned kelly not to be hanged so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it didn't do better in the cinemas
<START> or released on dvd or screened on a cable channel like amer life tv network i have been watching another favorite voyage to the bottom of the sea as well as lost in space and land of giants they've been showing them forever but aren't receptive to suggestions for other shows my father and i were big fans as i was already a big science electronics nut still am and my father was an old school chum of nader they both attended oxy together i still have memories of several of the episodes even though i was only 9 more so than any show that old i think it was televised on sat after bonanza some of the episodes i recall are the one where he takes the experimental drug that slows down action or the one where he body surfs the big ones i did that too or the one where there was a mine cave in and he conveys how to use mind control to have the trapped people slow their breathing by entering a trance like state that is the one show that i wish i could see again i got my wish with the original outer limits and sci fi theater john
<START> as hard as it is for me to believe with all of the awful reality shows out there over the past few years this one has to take over the top spot for worst one yet i am still wondering if this was actually just a spoof done by the sctv gang if andy kaufmann were still alive i'd be sure he was behind this can a rock band stoop any lower than has inxs to do such a shameful thing as this the premise is simple and moronic audition a bunch of karaoke rejects to become the new lead singer of inxs to take the place of michael hutchence who committed suicide in 1997 eight years and no hits later the band commit the ultimate act of patheticness by subjecting themselves to auditioning a bunch of talentless wannabes to be the new lead singer of a band that is 20 years past its prime so they trot all of these awful singers i thought american idol had its share of doozies who do atrocious renditions of just about every classic and predictable rock song imaginable and then they cut to the inxs band members who are seriously discussing the merits of each of these candidates you could see better and more original rock performers at just about any night club in any city in the world br br it has all the usual uncreative elements of every other reality show lame reality participants lame interviews lame host emcee lame judging of performances and the lame booting of one participant at the end of each show can these shows get any more predictable it's clearly a publicity stunt on the part of the band a last gasp of hope at rekindling their lost stardom before they are finally buried into oblivion michael hutchence if he had any shred of dignity when alive has to be rolling over in his grave not that inxs were ever a great band but i had no idea they were this pathetic if inxs are at all representative of what rock and roll has become this show would be the final proof that rock and roll is once and for all dead
<START> i love a good sappy love story and i'm a guy but when i rented love story i prayed for the end to come as quickly and painlessly as possible and just the opposite for ali mcgraw's character br br ali mcgraw as jenny alienated and irritated the heck out of me within the first 15 minutes when we learn that she has been diagnosed with a life threatening illness i couldn't help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor oliver or if anyone watching this film would even care if she didn't die her grating personality would probably have pushed oliver over the edge and eventually landed them in divorce court br br people love this movie but it's one of the worst of the 70's
<START> william castle is notorious among horror fans as the b grade director of the 1950s and 60s his gimmicks his cost cutting techniques and his unique vision are legendary it comes as no surprise then that someone jeffrey schwarz who's made countless documentaries would finally take the time to devote a documentary to his greatness such is spine tingler the william castle story br br i had a general understanding of who castle was having seen some of his films over the years i knew nothing about her personal life his goals and ambitions this film really fleshed out the man and gave me a fuller appreciation for the devotion he had for the craft of film making and his contributions to the horror genre the movie depicts castle as rival to alfred hitchcock with hitch being the artist who wins praise while castle is the carnival barker who gains cult notoriety but much less respect he is an icon to all second rate directors out there which is why it's not surprising that john waters is featured prominently in here joe dante and stuart gordon also have sizable roles br br his gimmicks were what drove his fame and the documentary takes great pains to explain them which is crucial for those who are too young to remember the rudimentary 3 d of 13 ghosts see separate review the buzzer in the seat for the tingler see separate review money back guarantees for homicidal watching these films now outside the theater we can judge them for their content which personally i still enjoy but we cannot fully appreciate what audiences once felt br br the climax of the film is when castle goes from cult director to hollywood producer having bought the rights to rosemary's baby he is put in a very special place for negotiating its film release hoping to direct he is sidelined to producer in order to make way for new director roman polanski while at first disappointed this proves to be one of the best opportunities of his lifetime a hugely successful film and a job he excels at who better to control the purse of wild artist polanski than a penny pinching castle this was to be his crowning achievement though sadly the film is more often connected to polanski than castle br br the remainder of his years are played out and we are given personal reflections by his daughter and niece across the board everyone seems to have nothing but praise for the man somewhere along the way he surely upset one or two people but you would never know it from this film and i find that find this is a celebration of bill castle's life not e true hollywood story fans of the genre would do well to pick up a copy of this work br br i would personally recommend picking up the william castle collection which has not only this but eight of castle's films in it with plenty of special features even this documentary comes with an audio commentary so you can hear how schwarz was personally affected by castle and have castle's daughter terry giving a running reflection of her experiences with the different films and remakes it's almost a whole new film
<START> this is very much not the sort of movie for which john wayne is known he plays a diplomat a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action the film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unexciting story br br for the open minded the patient and the thoughtful this movie is a rich depiction of an intriguing part of history br br there are two intertwining stories the big story is of internalised isolationist japan and externalised expansionist america clashing when their interests conflict the small human story is of an outsider barbarian wayne and a civilised geisha's initial hostility and dislike turning to mutual respect and love the human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nations br br the movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well the two lead roles are performed to perfection john wayne is excellent as townsend harris striking exactly the right blend of force and negotiation in his dealings with the japanese eiko ando is likewise excellent as the geisha of the title charming and delightful the interaction between her character and john wayne's is particularly well portrayed this is exactly how these two individuals as they are depicted in the film would have behaved br br the script is very well written it lacks all pomposity and is a realistic depiction of the manner in which the depicted events may have occurred the characters are real people not self consciously great figures from history furthermore the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety indeed the clash of a traditionalist and traditionally powerful isolationist japan and a rising newly powerful nation from across the ocean is summarised very well in one exchange between john wayne and the local japanese baron wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in japan and that passing ships cannot even put into port for water the baron responds that japan just wants to be left alone wayne's character replies that japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international shipping and that if things continue as before the nation will be regarded as nothing more than a band of brigands infesting an important roadway a very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as being in the right and saw the other as being in the wrong the resultant clash between two self righteous peoples with conflicting interests has its reflections throughout history a continuing theme that echoes into the present and on into the future br br cinematography and the depiction of mid nineteenth century japan before the accelerated growth towards industrialisation that was to follow later in the century is excellent a visual treat and an enlightening insight into japan's ancient civilisation br br i highly recommend anyone whether a john wayne fan or not to watch this film if you get the chance just be aware that it isn't an action film it is a representation of an interesting place and time in history and a slow boiling love story which much to their surprise comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters watch this film on its merits without preconceptions allow yourself to be immersed in its story and you will thoroughly enjoy it br br all in all an excellent film
<START> ya i rented it so shoot me br br a decent premise sets up an otherwise awkward story with no real payoff but at least it's shot well director jon keeyes takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside in most cases this should be a slam dunk but this little stinker derails quite quickly the cinematography is above average and the acting is mediocre at best but the story and writing is just plain awful slower scenes drag on forever and the scares are too few and far in between with no real climax to the film an eerie mood is set at the beginning but loses it's luster before any type of horror transpires and i found myself bored to death and making another sandwich the cover art is appealing and i suppose it's worth a rental if you're looking for mindless low budget dreck but if you enjoy a good story and eventful ending reach for something else
<START> if you like plot turns this is your movie it is impossible at any moment to predict what will happen next nothing is as it appears or ends as you think it will the characters are all gritty and engaging cage is at his best dennis hopper again shows his delightfully sinister side jt walsh is perfect in his last performance laura boyle sizzles dwight yoakum makes a film debut superbly in a cameo i categorize this movie as i am having a really really really bad day film not a slow minute in this film a real sleeper this movie is underrated and sadly overlooked
<START> this is one of those movies that's difficult to review without giving away the plot suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on beyond the initial superficial tom cruise screws around with multiple women plot br br the quality cast elevate this movie above the norm and all the cast are well suited to their parts cruise as the irritatingly smug playboy who has it all and then loses it all diaz as the attractive but slightly deranged jilted lover cruz as the exotic new girl on the scene and russell as the fatherly psychologist the story involves elements of romance morality murder mystery suspense and sci fi and is generally an entertaining trip br br i should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize what's going on br br if you enjoy well acted movies with twists and suspense and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic philip k dick style resolution then this is a must see br br 9 10
<START> i can see the guys doing the budget preparation for this flick well lets see now we spend 50 getting dirk benidict cause battle star galactic and the a team were cool the we spend 40 making a demon costume never mind that the demon is supposed to be incorporeal in the script and we spend the rest making the movie this was pretty bad and very cliche have a loved one present when watching or bring a good book
<START> i wanted to like this movie but it falls apart in the middle the whole premise is a good one and ties up nicely but the middle runs off tangent the people i watched with were getting annoyed while it ran off course and hoping it would end sooner than it did another person actually fell asleep during the middle segment i found myself day dreaming elsewhere during the schtick parts that had nothing to do with the plot i bought it for the eye candy and it delivered that well but it lacks pixar's writing and soul i think kids 8 and under will enjoy the ride at face vaule while missing the plot people old enough to follow a plot will find it wonders too far to return quickly and easily edit out most of the middle section make it 50 minutes and it would be a solid flick i wish i had better things to say but i don't
<START> a few weeks ago i read the classic george orwell novel 1984 i was fascinated with it and thought it was one of the best books i've read recently so when i rented the dvd i was intrigued to see how this adaptation measured up unfortunately the movie didn't even come close to creating the ambiance or developing the characters that orwell so masterfully did in his book the director seems to think that everyone watching the movie has read the book because he makes no attempt to demonstrate why the characters act and feel the way they do john hurt the main actor is droll the entire way through and hardly does any acting until the end we never really find out what he does for a living or why his love affair is forbidden or what the political climate is and why the main character desires rebellion this book cannot be done justice in movie form without proper narration and explanation of the political system oppressing the characters and the fact that those are missing is the greatest shortcoming of this film besides that john hurt was a terrible casting choice looking about 15 years older than the 39 year old winston he was supposed to be portraying on a more positive note however the rest of the cast was well chosen it's just too bad they were put in such a horribly adapted film with the wrong lead actor brian o
<START> listening to the soundtrack at the moment the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong in order to be able to type this i've seen it twice thus far and i should be ashamed for having seen it only twice br br i've seen all miyazaki studio ghibli films and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces except maybe for nausicaa which was even in the non cut up version too premature compared to the nec plus ultra manga still their strength sometimes becomes their weakness as they tend to get too naive positive chihiro or with more nuance a bit too explicit moralist mononoke at least compared to for example the other ghibli master takahata grave of the fireflies only yesterday raccoon wars but not this one br br in laputa miyazaki pours all the brilliant storytelling that tellers of tales have gathered and perfected over the ages combined with a bit of morale but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere but also with the humor and amusement of for example totoro every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties the pacing is so perfect that i know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being the story sets out as an action flic with mysteries hinted at but when the girl falls from the sky unconscious floating with the stone and the main theme kicks in you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you're about to uncover but the story then settles and gradually over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy hope beauty like following days of sombre gloom finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning knowing the path walked seeing the distance ahead but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it br br it is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind numb you should see a therapist br br despite the fact that technically image wise some more recent miyazakis might be more overwhelming this to me remains his undisputed masterpiece if you take a fraction of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986 you can only come to the conclusion that hayao miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years this of course has been suggested before but to me this is his only film that can on its own fully illustrate that simple fact if you miss this during your lifetime you'll die with a huge gap which would be a pity as the coffin costs the same
<START> saw it first in 1975 on some german tv channel and was hooked immediately afterwards i saw this movie around 12 times in cinemas and nowadays i have a videotape which i watch at least once a year this movie is excellent in every aspect direction acting cut musical score the sets are outstanding and very impressive the idea of a devastating world war starting in the late thirties seems like prophecy for a 1936 film the dictator of everytown is pure mussolini and raymond massey is just charming believable and ideally cast as the hero the positive tone towards technology and progress is quite refreshing by todays usually pessimistic standards especially the finishing scene which always brings a tear or two to my eyes even after watching the film so many times br br this movie is good on tv but it was made for the big screen so if you have an opportunity to see it in some cinema please do it's overwhelming
<START> zentropa has much in common with the third man another noir like film set among the rubble of postwar europe like ttm there is much inventive camera work there is an innocent american who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesn't really understand and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the natives br br but i'd have to say that the third man has a more well crafted storyline zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect perhaps this is intentional it is presented as a dream nightmare and making it too coherent would spoil the effect br br this movie is unrelentingly grim noir in more than one sense one never sees the sun shine grim but intriguing and frightening
<START> i enjoyed this movie and after watching it it made me wonder just how many 'caitlin rose's' exist in the world how many other girls have been subjected to this sort of sexual abuse and torment by classmates and have been too frightened to open their mouth about it just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another because as this film demonstrates who's right is not foremost important its who is popular and feared which manipulates the minds of youths and influences them to allow this sort of immorality to happen tiffani amber thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim and brian austin green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved and his best friend this is the kind of film that doesn't get the exposure it deserves remarkable and brilliant too good to be just a film made for tv
<START> some people have made a point of dissing this movie because they question the plausibility of black people in the old west asian people in the old west or women with guns in the old west period get a grip and read a book there were quite a few asians chinese there were quite a few blacks freedmen and everybody outside of the gentile class had ready access to guns it is the second amendment you know and as far as the use of modern language goes none of those westerns people have waxed nostalgic about actually used language that was consistent with the era depicted americans had different accents used different inflections spoke at a very different pace and used plenty of words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today don't blame historical inaccuracy for the fact that you just didn't dig it be honest maybe you're just uncomfortable with what you're seeing
