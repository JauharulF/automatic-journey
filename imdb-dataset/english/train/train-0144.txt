<START> hated it if you believe that everyone in the south is dumb morally bankrupt stupid violent a religious nut or a child molester then this film may be for you everyone is poor and seemingly ignorant in one scene two older men are talking in a general store and one mentions that he had molested a set of sisters before they could tie their shoes the man seemed proud of his actions and the other man clearly took it as a normal part of life very nice a teenage girl walks the back roads looking for her sister and no one offers to help her despite an obvious limp and lack of food or water no backpack etc strathairn's character is not only thoroughly disgusting and slimy but he is shown to be a religious believer who typical for hollywood reflects the vile nature of christians a scene in the movie is highly reminiscent of the end of cape fear the one with deniro bible verses being spouted by the bad guy i am from the great northwest but found this film offensive because of the wonderful people i know who are from nc wv al ms ky tn etc
<START> jackie chan is considered by many film and martial arts movie fans as one of the greatest action stars ever to grace the silver screen and police story cemented his reputation as the likely successor to the late great bruce lee if enter the dragon bared the so called bench mark of lee's greatness in the 70s then the same can be said about police story and jackie chan in the 80s br br forget about the rush hour trilogy or any of his us efforts the one film that really typifies chan's excellence not to mention kick starting his status as a high kicking bone crushing kung fu talisman as well as his movie career was this police story the first in a series of successful cop films set in mainland present day hong kong br br i've seen many of his efforts likewise the us based rush hour rumble in the bronx the medalian and the tuxedo to name and frankly many of them pale into insignificance compared to police story in those movies we saw a less 'dumbed down' version of jackie of whom didn't get the opportunity to utilise his fighting abilities to the maximum not to mention the fight sequences were no where as good as those in such efforts as drunken master police story to name br br the stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best featured in any action movie the shopping mall scene is literally one of a kind and has to be seen to be believed the flying shards of glass chan who is left dangling outside the bus only by his walking stick as a madman frantically drives through the streets of the town and chan successfully making usage of all sorts of inanimate objects and prop devices as weapons to fight the bad guys with br br considering he is known for injuring and breaking every bone in his body and putting himself in harm's way jackie's persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself by not relying on one is somewhat of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert especially as he has the bruises to show for it thus he has proved that he is no one trick pony when it comes down to devising and coming up with various and clever looking moves br br story wise there is not much to discuss but what it lacks in narrative it makes up with its end to end action and fight sequences as for the dialogue well it's not a really huge aspect of the film which is why most fans of jackie's and martial arts films are more interested in action as opposed to the story br br unlike say the matrix there are no wires or cgi or any form of computer trickery involved what you see is what you get and what you get with police story is a great jackie chan epic full of action and pulsating stunts it is miles better than rumble in the bronx rush hour and all his other american efforts br br police story is an excellent film and one i'd definitely recommend to anyone who is a novice jackie chan fan but of whom are unsure which one they should watch first
<START> we have high expectations with this one because its zombi 3 the official sequel to zombi 2 and directed by lucio fulci however its co directed by bruno mattei from night of the zombies and not written by dardino sachetti but by claudio fagrasso night of the zombies and its shot in the phillimines like night of the zombies and resembles night of the zombies hell of the living dead a lot as a result its more like a companion to hell of the living dead than zombi 2 fabrazio deangelis who produced zombi 2 and its editor tomassi and efx gianetto de rossi gave zombi 2 its magic zombi 3 is not magical its like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut butter but over the years i've grown to accept zombi 3 i could swear i saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room there was a senseless fulci cut and the mattei fulci cut is the one on dvd
<START> after finally viewing this movie in its entirety i am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike is it the worst western ever no i wouldn't say that but the last great american western a phrase i saw applied to it more than once not even close br br a movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichÃ©d that i've ever seen the movie can be measured in groaners per minute as in how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life there's so many instances of this that it's distracting cheesy lines come at you in waves predictable unoriginal and often br br if bad dialogue doesn't bother you then how about bad gunfights few westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously it's okay if there's a comic edge to such gunfighting such as in silverado but in tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good westerns the final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score but by then i was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving br br other than those flaws i can say the visuals are stunning the movie's well shot and the settings all look great the acting is passable especially considering what the actors were given to work with however if you're looking for the last great american western do yourself a favor go rent unforgiven instead br br 3 out of 10
<START> i would give this show a ten out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes you people are so damn sensitive it is inane so quick to point out the racism of the show and the jokes yet are also so quick to say ridiculously sexist pig headed crap like well duh some of these other shows do these jokes so much better because at least they have hot women so disgusting abortion jokes are great because really who takes abortion seriously anyways at least i'm not a bore son i hear that reba mcentire and sarah silverman are teaming up to do a movie about sisters taking a road trip together talk about a movie of the year
<START> passport to pimlico is a real treat for all fans of british cinema not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in british life br br stanley holloway plays pimlico resident arthur pemberton who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the 14th century duke of burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last 600 years br br accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by king edward iv of england which has never been officially rescinded to state that that particular london street had been declared burgandian soil which means that in the eyes of international law pemberton and the other local residents are no longer british subjects but natives of burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in it's own right and a law unto itself br br this sets the war battered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of english law and jurisdiction so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books destroy and ignore their clothing coupons flagrantly disregard british licencing laws etc declaring themselves fully independent from britain br br however what then happens is ever spiv black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the 'border' into burgundy as a refuge from the law and post war restrictions to sell their dodgy goods and half of london's consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration making their quiet happy little haven a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at that br br appealing to whitehall for assistance they are told that due to developments this is now a matter of foreign policy which his majesty's government is reluctant to become involved which leaves the residents high and dry they do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of pimlico br br eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege with the bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food but never the less fighting on in true british style as one bugundian resident quotes we're english and we always were english and it's just because we are english we are fighting so hard to be bugundians br br a sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of london learn of the poor bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockades br br will whitehall who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to it's knees by this new batch of foreigners especially as these ones are english br br great tale and great fun throughout not to be missed
<START> i saw this recent woody allen film because i'm a fan of his work and i make it a point to try to see everything he does though the reviews of this film led me to expect a disappointing effort they were right this is a confused movie that can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy a romantic fantasy or a drama about female mid life crisis it fails at all three br br alice mia farrow is a restless middle aged woman who has married into great wealth and leads a life of aimless luxury with her rather boring husband and their two small children this rather mundane plot concept is livened up with such implausibilities as an old chinese folk healer who makes her invisible with some magic herbs and the ghost of a former lover with whom she flies over manhattan if these additions sound too fantastic for you how about something more prosaic like an affair with a saxophone player br br i was never quite sure of what this mixed up muddle was trying to say there are only a handful of truly funny moments in the film and the endingis a really preposterous touch of pollyanna br br rent 'crimes and misdemeanors' instead a superbly well done film that suceeds in combining comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morals or go back to annie hall or manhattan
<START> christopher smith is an obvious horror fan and this is made clear in his debut horror flick 'creep' 'creep' although a little bit loose on information proves itself worthy of a true gory classic a little less glossy than recent us horrors amityville horror remake house of wax remake this dark and gruesome tale follows kate franka potente through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and disused railways as she and a number of others along the way try and flee a murderous attacker though some bad reviews have slated this film i truly believe that on a tight budget and for a uk production from first time director smith that 'creep' truly does live up to its name it delivers fast paced gory action more or less from the beginning sometimes too fast as the story is patchy in some areas but with a perfect location and the best character reaction at the end i've seen in a while 'creep' delivers some scenes that are definitely the stuff of nightmares
<START> this is one of the better classic edgar wallace movies from the german series it features all basics for a highly enjoyable wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies although his majesty mr kinski is missing you still have young joachim 'blacky' fuchsberger starring once again as the typical clever american 'womanizer' you have young eddi arendt in his best and just as well typical role ever the cool sophisticated british butler and you have not so young anymore lowitz as the melancholic yet very 'dry' ironic and thus highly entertaining police investigator furthermore you'll get offered a freakish and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask hence the movie's title you'll get a crazed out swinging soundtrack classic b movie action scenes partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives please remind the time of its origin yelling scream queens and on and on all those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin' cocktail of pure german edgar wallace campyness highly recommended
<START> you can call this one a flop and that's a very big one too quality isn't associated with the words national lampoon but at least the vacation and animal house entries were fun but this offering has got to be their most inane feature to date that i've watched ugh the three piece story crazily attempts to parody the clichÃ©s and stereotypes that flooded hollywood genre films which turns out to be completely unfunny and boorish dross br br growing yourself jason a corporate lawyer decides to quit his job and split up with his wife so they both can grow and do what they always wanted to do that's life as jason sees it and he takes over looking after the children but his decision to follow this path might not be the right one br br talk about leaden boring and stiff there only real interest is the small performance of the lovely diane lane the satirical element here seems to be pointing out something than actually just delivering it the silly humour is strained flat and particularly senseless peter riegert's keeps it very deadpan in the lead role and teresa ganzel bubbles along in her role br br success wanters after just finishing collage dominique corsair gets a job as a stripper and is rape with some butter by the dairy company presidents for payback she becomes interested in the margarine industry and virtually works her way to the 'very top br br probably the best one of the three but the competition wasn't too great the gags seem to want go more subtle with its sexual and power orientated tone but still they do feel more tacky and forced the idea had something promising and inventive to build on but the languid pacing begins to wear thin by the end and disastrous dialogue don't do it any favours at all the humour tries but more often doesn't come off despite the hunger the seductively ann dusenberry is pretty cold and manipulative throughout well after the painful ordeal and likes to gracefully bare it all quite a bit even the skimpy stripper outfit seems to get full workout for the opening half of the story popping up in amusing minor cameos ranged from dick millar mary woronov olympia dukakis fred willard robert culp and a favourite turn by joe spinell br br municipalians a serial killer who leaves copies of his driver's licence behind after each murder is being tracked down by an enthusiastically naive rookie cop and his old grizzled partner however the young cop learns that being tough is the only way to go when the pair encounter one situation after another br br stupid oh yeah sure if you're going to spoof something extremely over the top make sure laughter will stream off it obviously they forgot that even at its 30 minutes running boy does it drag robby benson's gratingly mock performance got rather overbearing with a wearied richard widmark doing very little as his partner christopher lloyd underplays the role of serial killer but his creepily wry and sympathetic performance works well and pretty much shows up the other leads elisha cook jr rhea perlman and harry reems appear when the jokes come they truly feel out of sync and get rather stale with its repetitiveness of making fun of these cop clichÃ©s br br in all the idiotic material laced with its skits comes across as disposable and the unbearable script is basically inept and witless only one or two few gags make it out each segment but really there's too many cheap stinkers or plain misses which stick in your head this is because it virtually becomes what it's trying to poke fun at and this basically shows in each story it loses sight the performances range from hot to cold but who can't deny the embarrassment that's felt on most of their faces director bob giraldi's first taste is a vapid one for growing yourself but success wanters showed some minor flourishes of mild effectiveness henry jaglom does a labouredly jaded job on municipalians rick meyerowitz's vividly crass drawings that opens the film are neatly devised and go on to set the style and mood br br this low brow comedy flunks it by overplaying it with the main interested being derived by the familiar cameos but really is it worth going through this putridly lame and restless get up just to spot them well that's up to you
<START> the united states was still fighting world war ii the movie was released in between ve day and vj day any studio worth its salt was either making fighting movies where fearless american soldiers beat the enemy or americans in general were singing and dancing technicolor musicals were what america thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed most musicals of the day were simply a bunch of musical numbers strung together with the best available plot slipped in to fill time til the next musical number i get the feeling now that the people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970 depressing how quickly we forget br br this film could've been called the search for jose iturbi but now everyone wonders why allow me to explain from 1929 his arrival in america until his death in 1980 iturbi was one of the finest pianists to grace a concert stage he agreed to do a few movies in 1942 but hollywood had been after him for nearly a decade at that time not only an excellent pianist but a successful conductor as well iturbi was very much a household word for more than 40 years br br the scene where iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of liszt's rhapsodies was planned early on and hasn't anyone ever noticed the other pianists were all children joe pasternak who produced that movie many other mgm musicals credited iturbi with interesting america's youth in classical music grayson's wanting an audition with iturbi in the movie was not unlike real life at the time everyone wanted iturbi back then the joke among soldiers was that gi meant get iturbi he did a lot of concerts at military bases br br gene kelly was a great dancer and frank sinatra an excellent singer but at the time this movie was made sinatra was barely 30 and had only been under contract to columbia records for four years kelly was already well known as a dancer but iturbi had by then been a world wide sensation for 20 years br br and as to the lack of a plot americans didn't need plot they were tired of war they were sick with fear for their loved ones and worried about the future they needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would work out fine in the end they needed music and smiles and joy and romance this movie and others like it delivered just what was needed br br enough lecturing mouse dancing aside the best scene in the movie occurs between sinatra and iturbi with each of them ignorantly complimenting the other's music br br if you have any interest in jose iturbi the spaniard who conquered more of america than de soto cortez and de leon put together please drop by my website www joseiturbi com where you can find a plot summary excerpts from movie reviews of the day and pictures from this and certain other mgm musicals of the 1940's as well as a biography and discography of iturbi br br trout
<START> i can't believe i am so angry after seeing this that i am about to write my first ever review on imdb br br this disney documentary is nothing but a rehashed planet earth lite now i knew going into this that it was advertised as from the people who brought you planet earth but i had no idea they were going to blatantly use the exact same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary mini series i just paid 8 75 to see something i already own on dvd shame on disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here save a james earl jones voice over and 90 seconds of sailfish that i don't believe were in planet earth br br but the biggest crime of all is that while planet earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecologic change disney took that story and turned it into family friendly tripe after the male polar bear's demise they show his cubs grown significantly a year later and spew some garbage about how they are ready to carry on his memory and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all no mention of the grown cubs impending deaths due to the same plight their father endured no warning of trouble for future generations if we don't get our act together nothing just a montage of stuff we have already seen throughout the movie and many times more if you are one of the billion people who have already seen planet earth br br i have never left the theater feeling so ashamed and cheated in my life
<START> certainly one of the finest movies i have seen for quite some time exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film denzel washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date and the rest of the cast perform beautifully christopher walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as i would have liked a story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love this is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets rockets and revenge the location of mexico city adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener all in all a truly gripping film from beginning to end highly recommended
<START> documenting a documenter that's one way to describe keep the river on your right a modern cannibal tale this film follows anthropologist tobias schneebaum who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago first to west papua and then peru tobias is a full bodied character a gay jewish artist anthropologist who eeks out a living on a cruise ship teaching gawking tourists about the cultures he has come to have a deep respect and understanding for author of several books documenting his time with both the asmat people of west papua and the cannibalistic amazonians in peru tobias has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become yet tobias' constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch one can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselves br br tobias makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed this film challenges the notions of morality and naturalness e g nudity homosexuality cannibalism watch for the graphic circumcision scene when questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce his non judgmental nature asks why not who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong this little sleeper is a must watch for not only national geographic types but also those interested in the art of documentary making this film shows what can be done shot on video the editing provides a quiet revelation of tobias' life that leaves you watching in fascination at times he despairs at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back especially considering his age and physical frailty we can be but grateful that tobias allowed the tables to be turned on himself perhaps sympathising with the desire to understand humanity and one's place in the world the filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance presenting for example one anthropologist who believes that tobias predetermined his findings of homosexuality in this case based on his personal interests that said you can't decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a cuddle move over river queen this is the best river ride i've taken in a while
<START> if i remember ira gershwin the lyricist and brother of george offered the gershwin catalog for this film and it was snapped up by the producers in many respects it was a typical 50's movie musical by the freed unit at mgm and directed by vincente minelli with a lot of help from gene kelly br br the gershwins were of course among the greatest of all broadway musical teams but in my opinion george himself was among the greatest of all american composers period gene kelly was of course one of the two greatest male dancers of the movie musical one guess as to the other and i don't imagine his casting was ever in doubt but i think the rest of the cast needs some explanation oscar levant was a noted personality in his time and as an actual friend of george gershwin he had to be in this film he was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a noted neurotic and hypochondriac and here as always he plays himself br br leslie caron was an unknown at this time and she was of the french gamin type a talented dancer she was never a real beauty george guÃ©tary who plays the part of maurice chavalier oops i mean henri baurel was greek and not french but he certainly is more than ok as a french boulevardier even if a little too young for the part br br gene's hoofer's voice is serviceable here but guÃ©tary has much the better vocal equipment though gene was better cast elsewhere as obviously in singin' in the rain where his character is much more calculating even here he shows himself to be something of a heel at times he was not for nothing cast as the original heel joey in pal joey the broadway musical i was not so enchanted with his i got rhythm scene with the children which does not appear as spontaneous as was intended in my opinion br br i also found nina foch's character milo to be rather irritating br br but the highlight of the film is obviously the lengthy ballet at the end of the film based on the title music with sets and costumes in the styles of the great french impressionist painters br br i found it difficult to believe gene and oscar as struggling artists and i don't think the musical numbers are as well set up as they might be but on balance the gershwin music is very well served in this film br br the dvd is well done with fine clear graphics when they are supposed to be and the mono sound is good but a trifle shallow
<START> this is one of the few comedies i can watch again and again and still laugh out loud in other places i have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious politically correct prigs there is neither here unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored maid br br the lines are hilarious and all the leads have never been better melvin douglas is especially brilliant br br if you've ever thought of or tried to build a new house you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel you are not alone
<START> who me no i'm not kidding that's what it really says on the video case br br plot short version pretty woman stands around smiling this for some reason makes all men kill each other br br find ariel where's ariel can't find ariel she's right behind you you idiot br br most of what can be said about this horrendous little space opera has already been said looks like br br a bunch of corny actors playing mostly convicts come in after the first selection of actors is knocked off very quickly then they get knocked off in the same way every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger pay check the alien virus hologram vr witch glitch seems physically powerless and doesn't do a thing why can't she just stay in the computer instead of doing her teleporting vampire routine actually it would've been more interesting if she had been a vampire or doing more than just standing around looking at people which is all she ever does this is enough to make all the men kill each other go figure br br this isn't really a space flick there are far more shots of the old western trail 1950's easy rider trail film noir's night club scene even a jog on the beach in fantasy land none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense the night club scene is in black and white of course worked with the wizard of oz doesn't work so well here this is probably a good thing as those few shots they do show of space are depressingly silly you will probably cry during those moments especially upon seeing that swirling space ship which looks about three inches long br br nothing is felt for any of the characters not because they are convicts or have no personality but because they are in serious need of acting lessons except for billy dee williams who really does look depressed and at a loss probably by being in this work br br this is one of those movies that when viewed with friends is going to cause some extremely loud silences especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic one liners including the line about french kissing a meteor did i hear that right perhaps not br br the original virtual reality girls get killed which means nothing as they are not even real to begin with well the other characters aren't either but that's beside the point haha br br what's kind of funny is that the scene that graces the video case is some sort of skull horror alien looking thing green filter added on top of that to give it more of a uh green look which is actually the android after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else afoot br br another odd deal i noticed whenever there is an explosion at least on my cheap dvd copy everything becomes highly pixelated i don't mean a little pixelated i mean huge blocks about 1 16th the size of the screen wow
<START> i got this movie because i worked at a movie store so i got free rentals it came in and the cover made it look alright hot chick carrying a weapon alright i'll check it out br br oh man bad move this was so horrible i spent half the movie watching in fast forward to get to the nudity which was minimal i think maybe three scenes of partial nudity br br cheesy dialogue crappy violence poor excuses of characters i feel bad putting this movie down because i know it was made on a cheap budget but so was clerks and it became a cult classic and a franchise br br 2 10
<START> awful absolutely awful no plot no point no end it looks like the director turned the camera on and then the whole crew went to lunch every day i'm trying to give this video away but no one will take it i'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because i like benigni roger i'm going to have to say thumbs down on this one br br
<START> malefique pretty much has the viewer from start to finish with its edgy atmosphere nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around 4 characters of which transvestite marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest soon the inmates find a diary of a previous inmate behind a brick which deals with his obsession of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell from here on everything deals with uncovering the secret of the book and its spells to flee from prison that leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light br br honestly i think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice but to me the ends are pretty loosely tied together anyway i was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast the kills are raw and eerie its doesn't take gore to chill your spine and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of the hell themes in hellraiser malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint at times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger when the retarded boy looses his fingers and is lulled to sleep sucking on marcus breasts it seems normal so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be with its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre shockers do i just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale several elements like the visitor with the camera the other inmates obsession with books and the toy doll vaguely pointing to the end don't fit tight in the story anyway i'll keep my eyes open for other movies from director valette although its a turn off to see he's is doing a hollywood remake of one missed call which was worn off and useless already in the miike version
