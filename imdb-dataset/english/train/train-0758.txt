<START> i think that it was just pointless to produce a second part of a movie like my girl my girl was a very good movie but it is ridiculous making a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters macaulay culkin as thomas j dies the story was over after the first movie i wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story going on that was senseless
<START> eddie murphy delirious is easily the funniest stand up concert film i have ever seen most stand up acts usually have lulls at some point but not this one folks for 90 min there is not one moment that is not side splittingly funny from the moment eddie does a hilariously dead on impression of mr t the laughs are non stop br br sadly this was done in 1983 and eddie hasn't done anything nearly as funny it's unbelievable that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show wrote a movie called harlem nights which was not very funny at all br br eddie if you're out there please go back and do a concert film in the vein of delirious believe me your fans will love you for it and i think you know that

<START> writer director john hughes covered all bases as usual with this bitter sweet sunday afternoon family movie curly sue is a sweet precocious orphan cared for from infancy by bill the pair live off their wits as they travel the great us of a fate matches them with a very pretty yuppie lawyer and the rest is predictable br br kids will love this film as they can relate to the heroine played by 9 year old alisan poter who went on to be the you go girl of pepsi commercials the character is supposed to be about 6 or 7 as she is urged to think about going to school some of her vocabulary suggests that she is every day of 9 or older br br similar to home alone there is plenty of slap stick and little fists punching big fat chins again this is formula film making aimed at a young audience entertaining and heartwarming don't look for any surprises but be prepared to shed a tear or two
<START> i am 17 and i still like most of the scooby doo movies and the old episodes i love the 1990s movies and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to dvd scooby doo outings of this decade scooby doo and the goblin king which i wasn't expecting to be as good as it was anyway back to get a clue i watched some episodes expecting something very good but from what i saw of it i wasn't impressed at all first of all i hated the animation it was flat deflated and very saturday morning cartoon standard easily the worst aspect of the series even some shows i really hate had slightly better animation even worse shaggy and scooby looked like aliens and i really missed fred velma and daphne as they added a lot to the old episodes when scooby doo was positively good i also hated the character changes because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries shaggy and scooby were now playing superhero something they would've never had done in the movies or in the scooby doo where are you show the theme tune wasn't very good either i can't even remember it and the jokes were lame and contrived though i do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast had they had better material and hadn't been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible which they did might i add in conclusion i personally thought it was awful and i am not trying to discredit it it's what i personally feel 1 10 bethany cox
<START> i know it's a power rangers gimmick and catered to 7 year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie if they are going to write a plot with crayons at least have the decency to make it silly it's kind of hilarious if you watch this we have a typical family filled with cliched characters father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself lolol air head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space funny stuff br br however the real great moment comes near the end when war dad and bad acting villain try to work a sword fight but then they realize none of them know how to probably because no room in budget for choreographers so they come up with this american gladiator type setting to run around in lol br br 1 10 rating because they try to treat this seriously
<START> what did producer director stanley kramer see in adam kennedy's novel and kennedy's very puzzling screenplay were there a few pieces left out on purpose and what about gene hackman richard widmark edward albert eli wallach and mickey rooney what did they see in this very muddled story br br and why did candice bergen who gave a horrible performance accept such a thankless role br br the domino principle wants to be on the same footing as the parallax view or the manchurian candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin a major misfire by stanley kramer
<START> if you liked roman polanski's repulsion you should probably check out the tenant since it's a similar concept just with polanski stepping in and playing the schizophrenic wacko this is actually one of my favorites of his movies second after rosemary's baby of course and is a straight forward journey into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the former apartment of a suicide victim the other residents of the building are all flaky and sticklers on keeping the noise level down even the slightest 'titter' becomes a big deal and polanski who stars becomes increasingly paranoid and succumbs to his loony hallucinations further and further as the film carries on it gets to the point where he is dressing and acting like the former tenant and you realize it's only a matter of time before he decides tor re enact her fatal leap out the window the film is a bit slow and dawdling for a while but if you have ever seen a roman polanski movie you should know it's going to end with a bang and this flick doesn't disappoint it's also best if you don't question the intricacies of the premise and just take it as a descent into madness because it's pretty trippy surreal at times polanski is very good as the timid deranged resident who somehow attracts the ever illustrious isabelle adjani we also get to see him running around in drag which is disturbing and hilarious all at the same time damn he makes for one ugly chick so polanski fans who can actually look past his thirty year old pedophile charges should enjoy the tenant as an entertaining psychological head trip
<START> there is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award well it does not deserve an audience as well ironically one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least every frame you feel you are getting the full picture its like someone is cropping your view from the edges the story is pathetic well i will be honest i could not bear to watch the entire movie the part that sucked the most was when i saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor these and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of steven seagal br br take my advice stay away from this piece of crap
<START> what would you do is a question that will stick in your mind for weeks after watching the emotional brokedown palace you will also be left wondering if alice danes was telling the truth or not a issue that is left unresolved and rightly so this is a particularly well acted and beautifully shot film although it is slow at times its pace is reflective of the story line but a lot of the film will have you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next the ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the shoes of the lead characters which are brilliantly played by kate beckinsale and claire danes bill pullman's performance is commendable too
<START> i was pleasantly surprised by the film let's face it the premise doesn't sound particularly appealing when having to hand over money for a the night's flick but it had an easygoing nature that wins one over there were no moments that i found uproarious and i doubt any that i'll remember the next day but this doesn't fail as a nice diversion what i found funny was watching it here in peking with my chinese girlfriend who never understands anything i like i told her there was a plot three guys have to bring back some weed to london hardly satisfying for her there is no mugging going on here for the camera which i'd been expecting after reading a number of the comments i do take exception however to comparisons with withnail and i not in the same league and i doubt was it intended to www imperialflags blogspot com
<START> when this first came out my dad brought it home we were amazed by it it was so different from anything we had seen before i was looking for a specific movie last night and i found the mind's eye again the box is falling apart and i am surprised that the tape still works although it is not 'finding nemo' quality graphics it is still very good they should sell this again it is a landmark for computer animation imagery highly recommended br br this is what it is br br the mind's eye is a spectacular odyssey through time your journey begins at the dawn of creation and moves through the rise of man and technology travel in the world of abstraction and on into the future with breathtaking computer animation imagery br br the mind's eye joins the imaginations of over 300 of the world's most talented computer animation artists with a powerful original music soundtrack this unique collaboration takes you on an incredible voyage into the mind's eye
<START> the most embarrassing moment in this film is when brady corbet says 'you've blossomed' near the end the film i practically died i'm still not really sure why the screenwriters put that line in there was it supposed to create romance because it nearly made me sick br br the rest of the script was almost as bad br br i've never liked the original thunderbirds but a thunderbirds movie had the potential to do so much this movie doesn't if it didn't have the big draw card of the thunderbirds brand it would have been shafted straight to tv or canned in the post production maybe even before br br like i said the best thing about the movie is when the credits roll up and they play busted's song 'thunderbirds are go' i can't believe i wasted 7 watching this through pay per view
<START> this movie has beautiful scenery unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must be a conflict this movie had none it spent two hours painting a beautifule scene and failed to ever place any activity in it the picture trys to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling br br if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don't expect a story there isn't one
<START> baby face is one of the better of the forgotten films before the code it was shown last night after the 1931 version of waterloo bridge on the turner classic network so i was able to watch the film as it is now with four plus minutes of it restored br br stanwyck is living in east st louis where she may have known the drunken parents of myra mae clarke in waterloo bridge her father is robert barrett she has lived with him since the death of her mother and in the restored dialog he has been pimping her since she was 14 years old now she is resident waitress and part time whore in his speakeasy her closest friend being chico theresa harris the african american servant who barrett keeps bullying it is one of the two good points of stanwyck's personality that she keeps standing up to her father about harris threatening to leave if harris is fired and since it is the grubby workers like nat pendleton who enjoy seeing stanwyck serve them rather than the flavor of the hooch he serves that brings them in barrett has to obey her br br the one guy who comes to the speakeasy regularly whom stanwyck likes is the shoemaker and intellectual adolf cragg alphonse ethier who sees great potential in the spirited girl if she will just leave her forsaken home he is also pushing the philosophy of friedrich nietzche and the idea of the will to power more about this later br br after she knocks out the local political bigwig arthur hohl and has an argument with barrett about this a still explosion kills barrett and enables stanwyck to leave her home town she and harris head to new york city managing to get free transport by a railroad freight car by sleeping with a brakeman james murray they reach new york and after walking about they see the gotham trust company established 1873 and the friendly guard tells her where the personnel office is br br we slowly watch stanwyck ascend the corporate ladder to the top similar but sleazier than robert morse dared in how to succeed in business without really trying but morse was a man in a man dominated company stanwyck knows her sexual allure is her weapon she goes through john wayne douglas dumbrille a section of the film that i always felt was the most shocking curiously enough when i watched it douglas wood henry kolker and finally george brent each ends up falling for her and either being pushed aside when no longer useful or destroyed by her brent the new president of the bank his grandfather founded eventually marries her and the crisis of the film is when the bank's economic situation is shaken especially after brent buys her a fortune in jewels and gives her valuable bonds brent is indicted will she stick up for him br br spoiler coming up br br the one thing about these films that is not admitted is that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still dictated endings the original ending had stanwyck boarding a ship for europe abandoning brent to his fate but realizing she can't do it to him returning to their apartment house and finding he's shot himself she is riding with him to the hospital as it ends now before the rediscovered footage was found the film ended with them apparently giving up all their money to the bank to save it and retiring back to east st louis to live happily if poor br br neither of these are good endings stanwyck should continue on her destructive course with brent the last of her victims but even without the breen office the script writers one is darryl zanuck by the way saw fit to have her find a moral center she has none at least none for powerful men whom she hates i don't think that a depression audience would have tolerated that type of conclusion br br there are other problems due to the changing styles of public opinion and changes in society it was a man's world in the corporate world in 1933 so stanwyck has her work cut out for her wood when she is going to be fired for an indiscretion with him admits that he did not want her to work br br but in 2006 stanwyck would have been finding woman all over the place in the film there are nasty catty remarks obviously some based on jealousy towards stanwyck from other secretaries and female employees at her rapid rise in 2006 she'd be frequently confronting women superiors and she would find them cutting her off at the legs very quickly of course if she finds one or two are lesbians she might try that road but it is doubtful and she also never seems to meet any men who are gay they do have gay male executives in business who wouldn't give a damn about her legs or breasts br br then there is her mentor mr cragg cragg is remade in the bowdlerized version into trying to make her seek a moral center in reality he pushes nieztsche but the way in a broader sense the nazis pushed nieztsche find your way to power and push it while nieztsche did stress power sometimes it wasn't the be all and end all of his theories otherwise nobody would read him today in college courses cragg is obviously self educated but only half educated in short if somebody who thoroughly studied nieztsche confronted cragg he'd make him look like a half educated fool and this is stanwyck's mentor a good film and for it's day worth a 10 but seriously flawed
<START> this movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be there were a couple of sub plots that for awhile made you think these items would all come together in the end but they didn't if you want a alien in the frozen waste story stick with the 1950's version of the thing not the abomination that was remade in gore o vision 20 years later br br i couldn't get over the fact that the alien looked pretty much recycled from independence day br br the bare minimum sets would have been more effective if they had hired actors who could actually act and carry off the intended mood br br lots of scenery chewing with little payoff
<START> a gave it a 2 instead of a 1 awful because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork but that wasn't enough to save it br br the sepia toned washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies nothing new there i can see there were some hat tips to other old classic movies ok no problem with that br br but a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting not something that would put you to sleep br br the story line and the script of this movie was awful the characters two dimensional slow moving some of the scenes were pretty to look at but ultimately as a whole it was quite boring i couldn't recommend it
<START> you could say that the actors will make a movie but this clearly proves that statement wrong most of the characters in this film lack anything to hold on to they play the part of cardboard cut outs being moved about in predictable and uninteresting ways the story is very simple it could be summed up in a few words but i'll hold back in case anyone reading does want to see this film br br i had to fast forward the parts where jack showed us how to be an obnoxious eater i'd have to say that 70 of this film revolved around cooking eating or getting ready to eat quite frankly i'd rather not spend my time watching jack chew noisily with an open mouth personally i could have done without the footwear references and jokes that pepper the first half of the film too br br outside of my own personal dementia the film really lacked anything worth it's time there were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like it was dragging when something happens the reactions of the characters are vague and dry br br best not to look this one up
<START> this movie was horrible i watched it three times and not even the whole thing it's just impossible to watch the story line sucks it's depressing and utterly disgusting i don't write spoilers for anything so if you want to know why it's so disgusting see it for yourself the only good thing about this movie was john savage his dialogue at the beginning and some funny parts in the movie the little kid in this movie is annoying and the whole situation is bullshit i saw this movie at movie stores around america so i assumed it would be a good movie jesus christ was i wrong the acting is all horrible and the nudity itself is lame and nasty another thing is starr andreef the other main character hasn't been in such bad movies in the past in fact she was in some pretty good ones same with john savage this movie sucks
