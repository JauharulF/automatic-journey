<START> this animated inspector gadget movie is pretty lame the story is very weak and there is little action most of the characters are given little to nothing to do the movie is mildly entertaining at best but really doesn't go any where and is pointless it's watchable but only just and is nowhere near the calibre of the animated tv show from the 80's it's not a movie that bears repeat viewing at least in my mind it's only about 74 minutes long including credits so i guess that's a good thing unlike in the tv show the characters are not worth rooting for here in the show you wanted inspector gadget to save the day but there who really cares anyway that's just my opinion for me inspector gadget's last case is a disappointing 3 10
<START> originally called the changer the nostril picker is a poorly constructed tale about a loner named joe bukowski carl zschering who likes em young unable to socially interact with girls he bumps into a tramp who teaches him a special vietnamese chant this chant involves whistling 'london bridge is falling down' whilst hopping around like an epileptic morris dancer nonetheless ugly joe tries it out and hey presto he is now a girl ideally he needs to be a young guy in order attract girls but lets not talk about ideals here this film was made in 1983 and released in 1993 in an ideal world it should have never been released br br the film asylum dubbed this horror hokum as mind numbing ham handed story telling its worse than that the nostril picker really takes the biscuit in fact the whole god damn cookie jar terribly scripted dialogue delivered by brain dead actors a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist just when things couldn't get any more absurd the story goes off on its own nonsensical tangent for instance joe decides to kill the girls by changing back into himself but i thought he wanted to get close to them not content with being a murderer joe also turns into a cannibal and eats some of his victims of which there were only around 3 4 br br the highlight of this terrible movie involves joe picking up a hooker steven andrews then taking her back to his apartment what happens next defies belief joe turns back into a man but also discovers the hooker is a man how does he react well in a benny hill esquire fashion he chases her around the apartment with a bunch of squirty dildo's only to trip up on a blow up doll god knows what patrick j matthews and stephen hodge were thinking of at least this scene paved the way for another priceless moment this involved the male hooker reporting the incident to a curly haired police officer with a 2 bit joke shop 'cop' uniform the hilarious acting is a must see especially the hooker's inability at saying dildo and his demand for satisfaction br br apart from the above mentioned incident this monotonous slash flick was a complete bore you know a movie's bad when the dvd trailers were more exciting normally i'd fast forward to the good bits only there weren't any here the main action sequences involved joe simply stabbing his victims repeatedly forget quick cuts matthews utilizes fadeouts one during a stab scene to limit any form of suspense there might already be one girl's non reaction to her fingers being chopped off is laughable normally i'd relish the words uncut but in this case they were far from a blessing just more agonizing cinematic torture the whole movie felt like an unedited episode of midsummer murders only less entertaining i'd hate to see the cut version br br to sum up the nostril picker is the most unentertaining thing i've seen since richard hammond's 5 o' clock show dismal performances made worse by a terribly tinny soundtrack and bad dubbing don't be fooled by the box label this is not a cult classic unless it qualifies for the lets use shitty horror dvds for coffee coasters cult which i think it does unless re edited to 30 minutes stay away from this coma inducing mess
<START> i give this film it's props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted but i couldn't get past the implausibility of the whole thing br br first and foremost a game built around the notion of russian roulette that has to fill on hour the big problem is that if you are doing a live show you run the possibility that your first contestant will be the one unlucky enough to draw the real bullet then what do you do you have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show the corollary is that okay you get to the end and the first five contestants survive which means number six has the bullet and can't possibly get the payout he isn't going to shoot himself at that point so it's kind of anti climatic br br second problem almost as big human nature people are going to flinch panic soil their underwear and do things that would otherwise not make very good television too much randomness that's why real reality television is actually tightly scripted and even more tightly edited br br the only random thing is the performance artist's rant about female sacrifices which were actually rare historically even that was predictable since she went through with shooting herself to no effect br br we are led to believe the shows ratings would increase while it was going on at 1 am in the morning unlikely with the token asian girl announcing each boost in ratings br br a point on race and sex big surprise the movies two minority one gay and two female contestants are the ones who survive so we are left with the two white males and of course the slightly less likable of them is the one who buys it the purpose of such a show would be it's randomness but the guy you like the least is the guy who dies br br the climax is that after spending two hours fighting for televised suicide the eva mendes character mendes produced and starred in this thing so she has no one to blame but herself actually grows a conscience when someone dies what did she think was going to happen she is promptly shot by a bystander angry about the whole thing motives never explained and the show went on to be a big hit really br br the problem with media satire is that it has to either have some grounding in reality or it has to be so over the top to be ludicrous like network this is neither
<START> this is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word 'horror' in order for it to be appreciated the main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and as with most younger children he gets frightened easily mainly because he simply doesn't understand things like why his father is hardly ever there for him from watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it but the little boy doesn't also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods as it is established early on in the film that the family is from the city also in the beginning as the family is traveling to the house they hit a deer then get held up then they argue with the locals about it and the little boy surely didn't find this introduction to the woods pleasant at all br br the wendigo is ultimately what his young innocent mind fabricates to explain all of this there is the american indian legend but when looking at the scene where the young boy hears about about it it is explained to him like bluntly and simplistically not because that's what the wendigo actually is but because that is how he understands it when you look at the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it obviously it was low budget and shot cheaply but the jumping montages use of light and general eeriness more than make up for it and the final question the film asks is is it all in your head or is it really out there 8 10 br br rated r profanity violence and a sex scene
<START> robert deniro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time this movie is so wasteful of talent it is truly disgusting the script is unbelievable the dialog is unbelievable jane fonda's character is a caricature of herself and not a funny one the movie moves at a snail's pace is photographed in an ill advised manner and is insufferably preachy it also plugs in every cliche in the book swoozie kurtz is excellent in a supporting role but so what br br equally annoying is this new imdb rule of requiring ten lines for every review when a movie is this worthless it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape avoid this movie
<START> love hurts that i think is the main message mike binder's newest film reign over me brings across whether that love has caused your relationship to become stagnant or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world love hurts the great thing about this film however is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future no one in this drama is perfect they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they can't free themselves from alone there is some heavy subject material here and i credit binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay character based and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead what could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how 9 11 effected us all ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret br br this is a new career performance for adam sandler i like to think that my favorite director paul thomas anderson was the first to see the childish pent up anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically the juvenility of a character like billy madison allows for laughs and potty humor but also can be used to show a repressed man shy and shutout to the world around himÂa man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell anderson let sandler do just that in his masterpiece punch drunk love and mike binder has taken it one step further sandler plays former dentist charlie fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the world trade center on 9 11 that one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result he became reclusive and started to believe he couldn't remember anything that happened before that day he really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him those that love him try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family he goes through life with his ipod and headphones shutting out everything so as not to be tempted remember br br reign over me is not about charlie fineman though it is about dentist and family man alan johnson a man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate charlie does played perfectly by the always brilliant don cheadle johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life he has no friends and when he sees charlie by chance one day his life evolves into something he hasn't felt in 15 years he revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family cheadle's character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and sandler's doesn't mind because all that was before he met his wife the two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of solitude that used to rule their lives once they begin opening up though it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the faÃ§ade they have created for themselves br br the supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads jada pinkett smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely but it is her final scene on the phone with cheadle that really showed me something different and true liv tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting perfect casting the many small cameos are also effective even writer director mike binder's role as sandler's old best friend and accountant my only gripe here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere considering it is his film last but not least is the beautiful saffron burrows she is a great actress and plays the love crushed divorcÃ©e trying to put her life back together wonderfully a role that seems comic relief at first but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to come br br binder has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies i have seen in a long time the direction is almost flawless the blurring between cuts and characters in the fore background really annoyed me in the beginning the acting superb and the story true to itself never taking the easy way out or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion even the music was fantastic and used to enhance not to lead us emotionally why after two great uses of the titular song by the who did binder feel the need to use the inferior eddie veddar remake for the end i don't know but it did unfortunately stick out for me reign over me is a film about love and how although it can cause the worst pain imaginable it can also save us from regret and allow us to once again see the world as a place of beauty and hope
<START> this movie was like any jimmy stewart film witty charming and very enjoyable kim novak's performance as gillian the beautiful witch who longs to be human is splendid her subtle facial expressions her every move and gesture all create gillian's unique and somewhat haunting character she left us hanging on her every word i should not fail to mention ernie kovacs' and elsa lanchester's highly commendable performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic kovacs and the latter as the lovable aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to the romantic scenes between stewart and novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is great but then again when is the chemistry between jimmy stewart and any leading lady bad
<START> reda is a young frenchman of moroccan descent despite his muslim heritage he is very french in attitudes and values out of the blue his father announces that reda will be driving him to the hajj pilgrimage to mecca something that reda has no interest in doing but agrees only out of obligation as a result from the start reda is angry but being a traditional muslim man his father is difficult to talk to or discuss his misgivings both father and son seem very rigid and inflexible and it's very ironic when the dad tells his son that he should not be so stubborn br br when i read the summary it talks about how much the characters grew and began to know each other however i really don't think they did and that is the fascinating and sad aspect of the film sure there were times of understanding but so often there was an undercurrent of hostility and repression i actually liked this and appreciated that there wasn't complete resolution of this as it would have seemed phony br br overall the film is well acted and fascinating giving westerners an unusual insight into islam and the hajj it also provides a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional islam and the secular younger generation while the slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship throughout the film may annoy some i think it gave the film intense realism and made it look like a film about people not some formula a nice and unusual film
<START> ah the infamous guinea pig series i honestly have to say that i've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series he never dies mermaid in a manhole and flower of flesh and blood being the exceptions and even those aren't great by any means but devil's experiment just plain blows there is nothing realistic looking going on here other than the climactic or perhaps anti climactic depending on how you view it eyeball piercing scene the victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to hideous more often sometimes hilarious tortures flower of flesh and blood is a more violent and gory depiction of fake snuff material but that film also falls flat on the realism level i applaud the japanese for pushing the boundaries and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in extreme film making but devil's experiment just doesn't hold up worth a look if you are a die hard if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about but i can only give this film an extremely generous 3 10 and that's only for the needle through the eye scene
<START> if you're looking for a hollywood action packed kid flick with the common bad language and violence this may not be the film to sit down for if you're on the other hand interested in watching a film with youre children that has actually some values like showing the importance of friendship and truth this is the film to watch looking at the program guide this is obviously what millions of other viewers have found not many low budget independent films have ever been aired as much as mr atlas the film is actually very funny as well as warm hearted and shows some beautiful locations masterfully captured by the sharp eye of the obvious brilliant cinematographer suki medencevic also if you're interested in looking at a muscular fellow with good looks the ladies can get an eye full let's support those who make good childrens film buy buying their videos and watching their products on tv enjoy
<START> the fourth of five westerns anthony mann did with james stewart this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named jeff webster who takes a cattle drive from wyoming to alaska via seattle he hooks up in seattle with his partners ben tatum walter brennan and rube morris jay c flippen that he has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip north br br but first he has to put up with insubordinate trail hands cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy manipulative ronda castle ruth roman who believes jeff could be a valuable ally in the future that's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain's looking for him for the earlier and justifiable killing of a trail hand br br jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy judge gannon john mcintire who runs the town of skagway alaska gannon locks jeff up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town he fines jeff the ownership of his cattle and jeff just has to eat crow for the time being br br in the meantime jeff agrees to ride point for ronda up to dawson in order to deliver supplies but this is just a ruse so jeff ben and rube can slip back into skagway and steal his cattle back of course judge gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by jeff with a rifle while ben races the cattle over the canadian border out of gannon's reach br br after avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other skagway men they finally reach dawson where jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder which just happens to be ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in dawson jeff then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold br br but then judge gannon comes up to dawson to get in on the gold action up there and tells jeff that he was getting a little bored with skagway and wants to try his luck up in the klondike himself that involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's claims jeff and ben now feel it's time to clear out while the goings are good leaving rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against gannon and his gang br br they look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by gannon's men because ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth ben is killed and jeff is severely wounded but that doesn't save judge gannon from his just due the ending shootout at night on the muddy dawson street pretty much takes care of that first jeff kills two of gannon's best gunman jack elam and robert wilkie then as ronda comes out to warn jeff that gannon is trying to slip around behind him gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in jeff's arms then jeff kills gannon as he's hiding under a wooden sidewalk revenge has spoken br br this is another rip roaring western that's right up there with the naked spur and the man from laramie why the universal dvd uses a pan and scan print instead of the widescreen print tcm uses is beyond me you'll wind up missing half the glorious alberta cinematography by william daniels so if you like well written 50s westerns then this one's an a list keeper br br 8 out of 10
<START> timberlake's performance almost made attack the screen it wasn't all bad i just think the reporters role was wrong for him br br ll cool j played the typical rapper role toughest baddest guy around i don't think the cracked a smile in the whole movie not even when proposed to his girlfriend br br morgan freeman pretty much carried the whole movie he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie br br kevin spacey wasn't good or bad he was just there br br overall it's a dull movie bad plot a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors
<START> gillian holroyd kim novak is a witch secretly she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor shep henderson james stewart she casts a spell on shep that forces him to dump his fiancÃ© and fall for her things are going along quite nicely until gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man she decides to tell him her secret but how will shep react when he finds out that he was tricked into falling in love with gillian br br as far as light hearted 1950s comedies go bell book and candle is good but nothing spectacular it's an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it just don't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread the movie's cute funny at times and touching in the end kim novak and james stewart do their best and have some real chemistry novak as others have pointed out looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way the supporting cast with jack lemmon hermione gingold and elsa lanchester is often laugh out loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from novak and stewart the biggest problem i see is that bell book and candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be is it a screwball comedy is it a romantic comedy is it a supernatural comedy had director richard quine stuck with just one approach the movie might have been even better and more memorable
<START> i quite enjoyed this movie for two reasons the first is that it gives an insight into the world of loyalism in northern ireland which is very rarely treated in movies most of which tell us about the republican struggle the second reason is the performances of the actors i thought they gave very honest and convincing portrayals of a very seedy underworld that not many people hear about outside my native shores br br all in all it is an entertaining ganster movie with stellar performances from a who's who in northern irish actors cast it wont move the earth although it may slightly open some peoples eyes to the murky world of loyalist paramilitaries
<START> i finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of show people i cannot comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words seeing the cameo out of character appearances of so many m g m silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself i really like the scene where marion davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie patricia pepoire make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees marion davies but it is something to the effect of i don't think i like her pop the corn pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history enjoy
<START> i ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on ebay with very high expectations i think i paid about 50 for this movie as an eternal fan of horror from cheesy 80s american slashers to european zombie films i told myself this was going to be great i can't tell you how wrong i was first of all i thought it was gonna be pretty much gorier than it actually is after all i've had heard about this film i was almost scared to watch it the murders are boring the acting forget it there's no acting the story even if we don't care is incredibly bad it seems they tried to get your attention with some weird sexual scenes and naked girls but unfortunately in this case it doesn't help the movie why there's no atmosphere and this is the worst thing about this flick it's just bad film making from point a to b though it's extremely funny and amusing to watch with your friends and a lot of beers don't make any effort to get your hands on it there are so many movies in this world don't waste your time watching necro files
<START> this movie was incredible i would recommend it to anyone much better than what i had already anticipated it was definitely a heart wrenching spectacular movie it is an amazing story with amazing actors and creators definitely another great movie with denzel washington shouldn't surprise anyone derek luke did a wonderful job as well
<START> this movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre which is my favorite genre of them all so when i saw it was free on demand i had to watch it it stars caroline munro from both dr phibes films she was his wife that died dracula a d 1972 the golden voyage of sinbad captain kronos vampire hunter the spy who loved me maniac and faceless br br brought to you by the people behind don't open til christmas and pieces heres my thoughts on this br br it opens on april fools day where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd promising him sex in the shower and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet all while hes naked the coach puts a stop to it but both parties swear revenge but the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive br br cut to the future and its th high school reunion or so they think bwahahha the only ones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid and its april fools day or really the day before april fools but the fun starts at midnight yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall then they finally break into the school and it starts storming br br inside they find food drink and a little shrine for each of them each of their lockers and belongings along with marty's the nerds locker and yearbook they also find the old black janitor caretaker who spends his time saying oooh yesser yesser i don't want no trouble sir and then is killed instantly pretty pointless character but hes still my favorite br br the movie takes a page out of alien's book in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see thats when everyone realizes that they're there to die and they start freaking out except for shirley who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this of course it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off very cool mind you the rest of the night goes as usual sex drugs and marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask whats their plan all we have to do is stay awake and wait till noon marty wont kill us during mid day seriously thats what he said apparently you can only kill at nighttime but will they survive through the night who will live and who will die and why are all the bodies disappearing rent buy or steal this great movie to find out the movie is actually very good filled with clichÃ©s car wont start dammit and just plain slasher fun not to mention they all have names like carol and nany and frank and joe and susan i recommend it to all of you and not to mention it has a spin off 1989's cutting class is a spin off from this slasher gem and that movie starts the career of brad pitt and roddy mcdowell br br favorite scene 2 people having sex the guy wants to finish but the girl doesn't talk dirty to me frank she screams uh tits dirtier uh tits f ck tits boobs f ck it seems to work for her and at her climax the killer electrocutes them both
<START> i do not believe all the praise for this movie the play and movie were a ripoff of sleuth michael caine wishes he were olivier and reeves wishes he were caine caine even had the nerve to do a remake of sleuth with jude law playing his original part jude law you mean the one that did the remake of alfie br br this movie was made during a period of caine's career when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling debts he would do anything for money he would star in such award winning movies such as this and beyond the poseidon adventure what seems to be driving the praise for this movie is reeves death he deserves better than to be remembered for this lousy movie and so does caine this movie can be found in the 5 97 bin at walmart along with gems like the island and blame it on rio
<START> watching cbs's surrender dorothy i kept wondering why diane keaton would want to be in it not because it's a television movie with the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses it isn't any wonder why academy award winning performers such as keaton turn to tv but because it offers no opportunities for keaton to shine a single mother grieving the sudden death of her twenty something daughter imposes upon and gradually becomes friends with the group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident adapted from the novel this teleplay gives us a group of self absorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid aside from being coarse and dim these phony people are incredibly unconvincing as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside one young man who wears muscle shirts to tell us he's gay hears diane keaton say surrender dorothy and actually asks that's from the wizard of oz right no genius it's from citizen kane keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death she tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage lots of kooky outfits but it doesn't sit well with the viewer since keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way here she's a crazed harpy who doesn't learn many lessons on her journey of self discovery the movie quickly forgets it's about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her this is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat it should help a lot of grieving mothers out there i can't imagine it helping anyone since it is intrinsically a downer muddled and baffling it's deranged
