<START> the films of upa are surprisingly well rated on imdb despite the fact that the animation quality is light years behind that of looney toons disney and mgm at their prime sadly due to rising costs in making pretty cartoons with high frame rates and lovely backgrounds the upa style which debuted about 1950 began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s after all the films were dirt cheap to make and they'd received several oscars to prove that the cartoons were now mainstream so as a result lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend wasn't reversed until the 1980s br br this upa film is one of the early ones the characters are very simply drawn any simpler and they would have used stick figures and the backgrounds were ugly simple line drawings with colors added in a very slap dash manner often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the items br br as for the story it's a jive story with a strong jazz style attitude some will love this others will just find it very very loud it's the traditional frankie and johnny story and because of the shootings and all it's probably not a great film for the kids heck because of the animation and jazz it's not a particularly good film for me either some will read my review and no doubt think i am a crank which i am to a degree however i love animated films and a little of this minimalistic upa style goes a very very long way and you can't seriously consider them great works of art just very very quickly made cartoons ignore the oscars and try watching some classic cartoons or something anything else
<START> sweet romantic drama comedy about stewart and sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is naturally they work together and can't stand each other you can guess the rest it's beautifully acted by the entire cast especially sullavan stewart and frank morgan has a witty intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning it takes place in budapest and was shot in hollywood but i found myself believing i was seeing budapest everything looks so perfect and dream like a one of a kind film don't miss it
<START> the orange tone to everything was just yucky oh yeah the main character lives in a ghetto that is all orange tinted with orange tinted people meanwhile to mentally escape from this crushing poverty of the body she plays a full immersion video game which sucks in that no rules are clear and no logic follows the gameplay she apparently earns an income playing the game but she is revealed to not be an employee of the game company lots of non speaking pauses later the story drags on slowly she uses a glitchy orange computer interface with an operating interface that is so visually annoying and i can only suspect a microsoft future release br br meanwhile i the viewer ask basically why she is wasting her precious time in some moronic game when she barely has the necessities of life oh yeah playing games is fun but what is the point when you're almost starving while she is piddling her life away playing some lousy even more orange tinted lame full immersion video game her dog runs off probably looking for an owner who pays at least a moment of attention to it and feeds it regularly or is stolen from the woman while she is ignoring her lousy orange tinted reality br br meanwhile she obsesses over some game her game playing team lost the entire uninteresting movie yawn so she wants to be the best of the best go get them ash catchem got to bore us all golly this main character sucks as a human being as well and has no redeeming qualities aside from her physical beauty which she could barter for some manner to escape her crushing poverty br br so she reaches the real level and it at least not sucks horribly and she is sent to kill a former comatose teammate mentally living in the real level finally the sucky boring bland orange tinted movie is no longer a tedious chore to watch but has the potential to say something along the lines the main character is trapped in imaginary computer generated poverty and she is actually in the real world now perhaps she will do the murder deed and live in the real world now well she kills the guy and he vanishes in a digital effect wow thanks idiotic director you suck you suck so very much director br br here the director had an iota of a chance to redeem himself slightly by burying this lousy lame moronic cruddy movie with a philosophical twist br br the director could have said the real world is there and if you live in it and contribute to it to make it better it won't be some cruddy orange tinted poverty land a clever way to make this suck tacular movie a agonizingly slow lesson on basic civic pride for the 1 of the viewers that haven't found something actually entertaining to watch at this point or are movie masochists br br nope director the director had to screw this all up by tossing in some cruddy digital effect and ruin all chances of redemption for this awfully lousy movie which was a waste of money a waste of time and a waste of viewer trust br br after that it ends good riddance i hope the director chokes on it i'm putting this hack on my avoid at all costs list for any other films his name is attached to
<START> i'm not looking for quality i'm just trying to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in britain this one was initially banned and re released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut br br some college kids spend their christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation there are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids which of them is the slasher the actual killings are not very gory so this video nastie is not really nasty there is the requisite flashing of the boobies but it has nothing to do with the college kids br br i had a suspect very quickly and i turned out to be right maybe i've seen too many of these the end twist was clever i have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality
<START> i want to warn you that there is a very bittersweet quality to this comment also this comment will be much more meaningful to you after you have seen the movie br br although it is tragically sad to say that movie bears a resemblance to my life that is so striking that it is truly scary the rest of you will never know how accurately that movie depicts how persons who have been in situations like that act and react in their later lives br br this could not have been a work of fiction it had to be based on personal experience br br my testament to the how good the movie was is shown by the fact that although it was one of the best movies i've ever seen watching my life portrayed on the silver screen was such a searingly painful experience that i will never be able to see it again br br but i endorse it heartily to all others as a chance to peer into the soul of another human being to the extent that you probably never experienced before or will ever again i know that for a fact because that's my soul you will be observing
<START> so there's an old security guard and a guy who dies and then there's kevin the world's biggest wuss kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive bratty and virginal girlfriend amy as he returns from work to a random house he finds his friends the sexually confusing red shorted kyle and the truly revolting sluttish daphne they are soon joined by daphne's boyfriend the trigger happy sex crazed macho lunkhead nick and there's the title creatures horrid little dogeared puppets who kill people by giving them their heart's desire kyle's heart's desire is to mate with a creepy yucky woman in spandex nick's heart's desire is to throw grenades in a grade school cafeteria i mean nightclub kevin's heart's desire is to beat up a skinny thug with nunchucks amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting slut daphne's already a disgusting slut so she doesn't have a heart's desire along the way a truly hideous band sings a truly odd song the hobgoblins randomly go back to where they came from then blow up citizen kane cannot hold a candle to this true masterpiece of american cinema
<START> i saw el mar yesterday and thought it to be a great movie it starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters ramallo manuel tur and francisca after that we jump about 10 years to an hospital where the 3 friends meet again br br religion sickness love violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tension filled movie br br i see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story it's a violent intense and sad story people are expected to suffer to cry to get hurt to bleed and i think that what the film shows isn't done for pure shock value or presented in a distasteful way i know that some people like their films clean even those with violence in it but sometimes a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work this is one of those movies and a great movie it is br br the only fault i found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some plot details weren't 100 clear and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie it all made sense but it wasn't anything of much importance to the overall story so i still give this movie a 9
<START> jim henson's muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood this film makes me feel like a kid again okay the muppets are back with miss piggy and kermit the frog and their friends the premise is that they are trying to get on broadway in a musical show in where else but new york city you will see cameos by the then new york city mayor ed koch anyway the film turns 25 this year and i hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the muppets gang the problem with the show is kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in new york city it's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself
<START> first of all what is good in the movie some pretty actress the exotic background the fact that the actors don't laugh while acting i would have if i had been in their situation i don't know the storyline is simple a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who another abstract painter killed his little brother a male prostitute raped by another priest when he was young i'm afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers art or religion dennis hopper is not very good here this is the worst episode of the worst season of profiler the serie with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences the uncle is the policeman who the girl who lives at another victim's house could have a baby with the priest etc etc
<START> i've always enjoyed kenneth branagh's versions of the shakespeare classics as he always does a very good job but in this movie the one who lifts the whole movie is none other than the always great actor laurence fishburne surely he has made some poor choices in films even though he's a wonderful actor but in this one we're truly given the real othello the passion the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger alongside with fishburne's well portrayed paranoia and furthermore we're finally given a black othello br br i don't think they could have chosen a better othello who else could have given him that blend of sympathy antipathy love hatred and not to forget those fiery eyes branagh is good as always but not at his peak irÃ©ne jacob's desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak whilst laurence fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie do watch it
<START> this is a story of a jewish dysfunctional family the parents have divorced and mom remains back east in the house the father murray abromowitz moves with his children to california and moves around beverly hills so that his children can get the best education possible br br things really become funny when marisa tomei murray's niece comes to lives with the group br br the film deals with the various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the affluent neighborhood br br jessica walter costars as a woman who wants murray to move in with her since she wants a companion br br carl reiner and rita moreno come in towards the end they play murray's brother and sister in law respectively they're also the parents of tomei in front of the children reiner lets loose reminding murray that he has been paying the bills for them all along br br the film ends on a sour note as the embarrassed family moves out of their fancy digs and take to riding around beverly hills in their car i guess the film is promoting independence and some good old self esteem
<START> this was one film i wanted to watch always when it released the promos were eye catching and govinda in a negative role was a surprise br br but the film isn't that good br br it has lot of flaws br br the start is good and till the murder everything goes well but the film falls flat when the romance track starts between govinda and karisma and the songs that follow br br then the twist about govinda and tabu being in love leaves more doubts and flaws and then how come govinda turns into a rich criminal from a poor villager br br the last flashback too is prolonged and also the entire clash between govinda karisma and tabu br br n chandra disappoints music is okay bahot khoobsurat stands out br br govinda tries a negative role and does very well in it though he overdoes it too much at times karisma is good but irritates at times with her cries tabu is okay nirmal pandey still doesn't know the difference between loud screaming and acting rest are okay
<START> this is the kind of movie which shows the paucity of french cinema when it comes to making thrillers the director's desire to sound american is so glaring that you will not be fooled a minute unless you have not seen a serial killer movie since peeping tom br br two male cops or one and a half more like as you will see horrible murders a plot more complicated than complex charles berling is not lucky with the genre see the astoundlingly dumb l'inconnu de strasbourg a couple of years ago the scenes with his pregnant wife which are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot are among the worst ever filmed add a steamy love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a pg 12 and thus to attract the huge adolescent audience a violent and absurd conclusion followed by a silent epilogue who could make a nice commercial for the cÃ´te d'azur it's really the silence of the lame
<START> idiotic hack crooks a babe a safe a plan and a baby add them all up and you get the best comedy you've never heard of br br even with some a list star power at least a minus okay b plus this movie got very little publicity br br but that does not diminish its genius br br terrific writing solid delivery and a believable group of characters some truly classic lines and a fun twist at the end br br this is not some watered down nutty professor comedy these are low life bad guys they speak low life bad guy language and they do low life bad guy things but they do it for your amusement and entertainment and they do that well br br one of the best comedies i've ever seen
<START> if this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic it might i say might have been a hit have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults well this is it every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards it would be hard to find another film with this kind of production budget that contains so little of any value whatsoever the whole thing from the opening scenes defies logic dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical ditto for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself what is really mind boggling is that some buffoons in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash wow
<START> there was something here with the female lead having this perfect life she's always wanted after the worst life possible beginning as a child prostitute and winding up with eric roberts but her background makes it impossible for her to trust dean cain and this utterly destroys it in the end it sounds weird but i like the position dean cain was in at the end and the choice he made he can't hurt her because he loves her and she's the mother of his child i think the time frame makes it clear it's his child and not his brother's but at the same he can't forgive her for all she's done sleeping with his brother which shows the love and obligation he felt was pretty much one way and then being part of his death in better hands this would have been a better movie but for something i caught on late night cable it's not bad
<START> this is a pretty decent example of film noir the setting is the early 50's with the communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the us government br br richard widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples he gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing a list about him the interesting thing was that he was not only an anti hero but through most of the film an unlikeable anti hero that is not very normal jean peters gave a so so performance as the hooker with the heart of gold that great character actress thelma ritter shines as the stool pigeon br br the plot had its fair share of twists and turns wisecracks and tough talk there is a fight scene near the end of the movie in the subway station that was pretty gritty and exciting br br i think noir fans like myself will enjoy this film for non noir viewers it may seem a little dated and the whole commie thing a tad overdone
<START> a murder investigation goes on back stage while the vanities on its opening night plays on to an unknowing audience odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast its production numbers and the sheer novelty of the film br br gertrude michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show's stars kitty carlisle and carl brisson as well as starring in the infamous sweet marijuana number which was also on a 70s bette midler album so while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage bumbling detective victor mclaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman br br we quickly learn that the maid dorothy stickney loves brisson from afar that the wardrobe lady jessie ralph is brisson's mother and that the stage manager jack oakie butts into everything lots of plots twists among the musical numbers the show's best known song is cocktails for two kitty carlisle also sings the haunting where do they come from and there's a weird rhapsody that erupts into a harlem specialty number featuring duke ellington quite the cast br br some terrific acting here especially gertrude michael and dorothy stickney kitty carlisle is quite good as well brisson is a total zero though br br charles middleton plays homer toby wing plays nancy donald meek plays the doctor and also see if you can spot ann sheridan and lucille ball among the show girls
<START> it could have been a better film it does drag at points and the central story shifts from boyer completing his mission to boyer avenging wanda hendrix's death but graham greene is an author who is really hard to spoil his stories are all morality tales due to his own considerations of catholicism guilt and innocence very relative terms in his world view and the human condition br br boyer is luis denard a well known concert pianist who has sided with the republicans in the spanish civil war he has been sent to england to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed unfortunately for denard he is literally on his own everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the falagists of spain in particular katina paxinou mrs melendez a grim boarding house keeper and peter lorre mr contreras a teacher of an esperanto type international language wanda hendrix is the drudge of a girl else who works for mrs melendez the local diplomat licata victor francken is already a willing associate of the falangists br br the brits holmes herbert miles mander and best if not worst of the lot george coulouris don't give much hope to boyer's cause which he soon grasps may be britain's before long herbert and mander just retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the ramsay macdonald's and stanley baldwin's governments during the civil war coulouris here is a typical col blimp type always impeccable in his native english diction he is sharp in showing his dislike for foreigners in general br br the one ray of hope is lauren bacall rose cullen here trying to play her role as well as she can but she can't really she's an aristocrat the daughter of a press lord it was bacall's second film and sad to say almost sank her long career she does act well but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual effect of starring with humphrey bogart and being directed by howard hawks boyer is a fine actor but he's not bogie and herman shumlin is not hawks her next film returned her to bogie and hawks again and her star resumed it's ascendancy br br it's a bleak film as was the novel boyer's mission never succeeds as he has too many hidden foes all over the place but the villains are likewise also losers frequently with their lives br br with dan seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of katina paxinou and the man who destroys her it is well worth watching to catch the warner's lot of character actors doing their best given the weakness in direction
<START> i mean really this is not going to help the australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind okay if you're a stoner and have nothing better to do then maybe i think film makers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have and this is not the vehicle for it come on now this film is just tacky
