<START> this is a truly wretched little film admittedly the original un holy trinity was governed by the law of diminishing returns with the third the final conflict degenerating into a ridiculous sub plot about half way through the film apparently merely to provide the requisite needlessly convoluted deaths that had by now become the whole raison d'etre for the omen series but then to foist this jumped up tv movie beware purchasers of the omen box set on dvd don't be fooled by the widescreen ratio of the transfer this was and is strictly small screen stuff on the back of a series of generally fine demonic chillers was unforgivable particularly endorsed as it was by the exec producer and producer of the first three movies mace neufeld and harvey bernhard i'd give away the plot if there was any besides the usual death scenes hopelessly toned down for tv sensibilities and some of the worst acting i've seen all involved in this project down to the catering people should be ashamed this travesty ever made it to the screen let alone masquerading under the omen name if one person is convinced by my review to avoid this mess i'll feel better for it
<START> a good picture is worth all the words this film has the most poetic scene ever dreamed of about people with down's syndrome and i won't spoil it by telling you you'll want to see it yourself br br pasqual duquenne is an amazing actor i did not need to understand a single word he said to understand his meaning br br the film has a magic of it's own after watching it i understood better that we put too much value on achievement and not enough on the people we love passion and simplicity is all we need
<START> sure this movie wasn't like 16 blocks inside man an american haunting etc br br but it was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us i found this movie really great and scary br br i live exactly where they filmed this movie san pedro california and we have heard true stories based on incidents of this movie br br i dunno if you've heard of the famous boat in long beach queen mary well that boat is haunted i believe in spirts illusions and parallel or however u spell that is real everybody's in there own universe br br and the mind is a powerful thing br br i recommend to watch this movie it's great and not bad directing at all br br for those who rate it a 1 they don't understand the film its meaning its plot its view and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us br br ty br br victor
<START> first of all i would just like to say to everyone who has seen this movie that the actor who played the transvestite is one of my friends his name is robert dugdale he's a terrific actor although it doesn't say much about his filmography he's been in several plays and musicals he is currently residing in terrace b c that is where i am from he comes over to our house almost every saturday laughs okay now about the movie i wouldn't recomend this to anyone who hasn't seen it for it is not a movie worth watching the main reason i found it to be a bad movie is it never stays in place it keeps bouncing back between time so kinda hard to follow at some points and second its really boring laughs although the acting is great the movie just doesn't compare
<START> my father grew grew up watching george reeves as superman and when i was a little kid he had episodes on vhs and let me view them including this movie passing them down in the family if you will and i loved it br br clark kent and lois lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it's up to superman to stop this mayhem br br it's just so wonderful and fun to view the old style special effects and sound the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology george reeves was my hero when i was a little kid and i'm 16 now it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are
<START> this is just flat out unwatchable if there's a story in here somewhere it's so deeply buried beneath the horrid characters and jarring camera work that's it's indiscernible there's a group of vampire hunters who go around doing their thing and the vampires they kill have little aliens inside of them they pop their heads out and talk like speedy gonzales if you can imagine a blood and gore covered alien sock puppet screaming in horror as a cowboy dude zaps it with a cattle prod well that's what you get here these folks are loud obnoxious violent and just extremely annoying then there are some anti human humans who stand around in their cgi spaceship being so incredibly pompous that it's impossible to take these folks make hillary clinton seem like a right wing extremist in comparison they're friends with some vampires or something who cares br br then there's the camera work remember how everybody hated the thousand cuts a minute crap from the recent rolleball remake the folks who made this movie love that stuff there's enough of it in here for three really crappy nu metal videos on mtv br br nuff said this thing smells in comparison dracula 3000 is a masterwork
<START> definitely at the top five of best john garfield movies has to be pride of the marines it's the true story of marine private al schmid who at the cost of his own sight while wounded held off a horde of storming japanese on guadalcanal br br the story nicely segments in three parts al schmid's home life where he's a simple working stiff who's just getting serious with a woman and who likes nothing better than his bowling night pearl harbor is bombed and he's off to war as millions of others were br br the second part is at guadalcanal and we see part of the action where he's in an isolated machine gun nest holding off japanese troops his action prevented marine positions from being overrun but a grenade does in his eyesight br br and of course the third part is his painful adjustment to civilian life and to reassure himself that people aren't just caring for him out of pity most of all that girl he was seeing eleanor parker br br this film was broadcast on tcm on john garfield's 95th birthday and there was a documentary on garfield hosted by his daughter one of the people interviewed said that garfield was the actor most believable in working class roles in having and holding a union card br br in that respect he was lucky in that he did land with warner brothers in hollywood though he kept getting typecast in gangster roles in the tradition of that studio garfield was terrific in these parts because of his background because he came from the kind of life al schmid had with the exception of garfield's jewish background br br in that respect he was perfect to play the part of a working class hero like al schmid who accepted the responsibility of defending his country no super heroics here just a guy who'd rather have been back in philadelphia but doing a job that had to be done br br it's a great part for garfield it's a film one shouldn't miss i do wonder though whatever happened to the real al schmid
<START> this is truly one from the golden age of hollywood the kind they do not make anymore it is an unique fun movie that keeps you guessing what is going to happen next br br all the actors are perfectly cast and they are all great supporting actors this is the first movie i saw with ronald colman in it and i have been a fan of his ever since reginald gardiner has always been a favorite supporting actor of mine and adds a certain quality to every movie he is in while he played a different kind of character here he still added something to the movie that another actor cast in this character would not have added
<START> this is truly an awful movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life it is simultaneously bland and offensive with nudity and lots and lots of violence however the nudity is not that exciting and the violence is repetitive and boring also the plot is flimsy at best the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped and the acting is some of the worst i have ever seen br br i have heard that this movie is supposed to be funny but it's not i did not laugh once while watching it nor did i even crack a smile the makers of this film tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie and they failed on both counts br br some poorly made movies are funny because they are so bad but this is not one of them
<START> this tragicomedy written by famous serbian theatre film writer dusan kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category and yet its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value a masterpiece one should not miss to see preferably with subtitles and not dubbed br br in an aged bus en route to capital belgrade a looming war decides the passengers' behaviour two gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come their singing both divides and connects stages in this extraordinary road movie real life kostic brothers are amateur actors but together with stanojlo milinkovic as farmer who's plowed the road give a real life performance br br the spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war an insight into nation's collective person everyone is aware that war is just about to begin but they try to live their own lives the best they can hoping that ignorance might avert the tragedy using a simple movie language director slobodan sijan paints a picture of society torn by previous war world war i but also highlights personal portraits with success provincialism of a singer inexperience of the newlyweds seriousness of the great war veteran who is on way to visit his recently conscripted son and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a german spy br br brilliant in its narration with memorable soundtrack especialy the gispsy songs and adjusted atmosphere well photographed and edited this feature sijan's feature debut was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter sweet comedies that will define serbian cinematography of the 1980s maratonci trce pocasni krug kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota and my other director's favourite davitelj protiv davitelja
<START> this isn't 'bonnie and clyde' or 'thelma and louise' but it is a fine road movie it sets up its two main characters gently and easily viewers learn the underlying tensions quickly which is a tribute to the director there is the young french and english speaking son who wants to do well in france has a french girlfriend and who drinks alcohol parties as young men do and there is his moroccan arabic and french speaking father who devoutly follows his muslim faith with generosity and the wisdom of elders and who rejects the new culture surrounding him like mobile phones the film could explore very powerful politics the odd couple drive thru the former yugoslavia thru turkey and then thru the middle east to get to mecca these are areas where the muslim populations have been involved in wars repression ethnic cleansing where dictators have pursued torture and summary executions to hold power and where religious communities are in constant deadly battle with each other yet the film moves thru those places and possibilities with only hints of such agendas the relationship between the two is key to this film and faith politics are the backdrop it seems to be saying that we are all human and need to understand and care for each other in order to manage well in this world it certainly isn't 'natural born killers' and is all the better for it
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have seen this year you should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here there are spoilers gray matters centers on gray and sam baldwin heather graham and tom cavanagh only gray and sam are brother and sister living together in everyone else's eyes as man and wife no sex but just about everything else early on the movie starts with its theme 'the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions' gray and sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him she does it and gets to the nitty gritty questions too when she signals her brother to come over they start a 3 way date charlie bridget moynahan is the girl of their dreams like all the right things etcÂ sam final hits gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal that charlie accepts in one week charlie gray and sam are to be in vegas in the next week charlie and gray are off shopping for wedding gowns apparently charlie has an off the rack figure gray is slurping an iced latte when charlie suggests gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a 10 000 frock for her while charlie is zipping her in this 'down payment on a house' gown gray continues to slurp on the latte i swear it was like a feed bag what should happen but 'woops ' latte all over the gown it is never explained how they got out of bloomingdale's bridal salon with out a 10 000 mocha colored gown back to 'reality' Â caesar's palace las vegas they have the 'high roller room' sam is a resident surgeon and charlie is an intern zoologist Â were do they get all this money gray kicks sam out to the single room down the hall so she and charlie can have a bachelorette drink a thon were you guessed it they kiss gray remembers everything charlie remembers nada they make it to wedding chapel and right when the reverend gets to his line if there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds gray gets the hiccups gray excuses herself for some reason the reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again 'hiccups' gray gets back to ny and starts dating any man she meets literally and of course one is you guessed it again gay the other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver alan cummings named gordy he is smittened with gray but the feelings are not returned they become great friends this is good because when she comes clean with sam about the kiss he blows up and kicks her out of their apartment when sam comes to his senses he goes to her office gray works at an ad agency this office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone it has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency sam gets gray in one of the conference rooms for a not so private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office this is where i doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar 'sorry no men' says the bouncer so gray and gordy return with gordy in drag bad drag he was in a sleeveless black satin like blouse a string of pearls and a grandma's church hat no lesbian would ever confuse this 'man in a dress' as a drag queen much less a woman the bar was also the straight man's fantasy of what a lesbian bar is full of victoria's secret models everything turns out peachy Â she goes home with her firm's client gray happens to be on the woman's account and finally does more then kiss for some reason no one tells charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with gray but that is for the sequel
<START> this movie will go down down in history as one of the greats right along side of citizen kane casablanca and on the waterfront someone please convince leno to do a sequel leno and morita are a comedy duo the likes of which haven't been seen since abbot and costello the evil that emanates from chris sarandon tom noonan and randall tex cobb will give you the chills dingman's character as the buffoonish oaf hearkens back to the days of shakespeare's comedies and the climax my goodness the climax i won't ruin it for you but it makes the explosion of the death star pale in comparison if you can track down this hard to find gem do yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately i'm still holding out hope for a special edition dvd one of these days
<START> film can be a looking glass to see the world in a new light good night and good luck for instance offered parallels to modern judgement without evidence and encroachments on freedom it is easier to examine a moral problem when it is not too close to home by putting it in a fictional or historic context removed from our immediate situation with pornography we consider ourselves 'enlightened' and our forefathers to be hidebound by quaint ideas usually involving fire and brimstone but the definition of what is obscene can easily fall prey to ignorance and unscientific interpretation instead of evidence bettie page was a cult icon of an era which included not just mccarthyism but the banning of comics such as tales from the crypt on the basis that they would turn youths into half mad juvenile delinquents this film developed from key questions raised in her life poses dilemmas that are as relevant today as back in 1950 br br our film opens with two key scenes in the first we see well dressed respectable looking men in a seedy bookshop one of them asks for pictures of women in kinky boots and being restrained then turns out to be an undercover cop conducting a sting the second scene shows bettie page waiting to be called as a witness looking quite demure as if she had just come out of church br br the first 50mins are in black white old fashioned film effects such as wipes and fades add to the sense that we are watching a film from bygone years as do the mannerisms of the cast skilfully recreated 1950s scenes contemporaneous slang phrases and the terse dialogue associated with film making of the period archive footage is frequently intercut which will delight many and irritate others in keeping with its theme the movie is almost a collection of different types of photography in motion and the older clips of fabulous beaches and landmarks juxtapose well against bettie's classic poses hearken back to an age of 'health nature' magazines although i admit that if you are not captivated by the story you may find the effect a bit choppy br br very soon we go into flashback bettie escapes a depression years downtrodden life in nashville enlivened only with church singing and soul saving and goes alone to make her own way after her initial success her modelling work splits into two strands the mainstream glamour work focussing on her over the rainbow smile and the 'specialist interest' photos involving dressing up in high heeled boots and light bondage gear in an earlier audition reminiscent of a scene with naomi watts' character in mulholland drive who was also called betty she gives a performance that is full of emotion contrasting with her normal animated cheerful but ultimately bland day to day expression is part of her still unfulfilled bettie is frequently rejected in auditions once they realise she is the well known pin up girl but we have never been asked to feel sorry for bettie page her abusive childhood is quickly referenced and skipped over when she is raped by four hometown lads we see only the threat and then bettie recovering and surviving picking herself up in deserted woodland and putting on the brave face of someone who refuses to lie down and die br br although no nudity is involved it's bettie's special interest photos that eventually arouse trouble when we go back to the court the opinions of a clergyman on the corrupting influence of such photos are taken as evidence a psychologist authoritatively says how the photos lead to 'suicide murder and psychosis' in youngsters who are exposed to them presumably not in that order eventually a star witness explains how his son's life came to an end as a result of such photos 'being 'trussed up like that' it is not made clear how being 'trussed up' causes death the text accompanying a series of bettie's photographs in a magazine tell how she was forced to endure 'terrible agonies' with the fetish restraints the audience knows that she actually found them quite hilarious and that the wordings like the photos themselves were pure dramatisations after a 12hr wait bettie is told her evidence she is the one person who could state definitively that she was not photographed in agony will 'not be required' the 'horrors' of the photos have been proved br br if this all sounds like the dark ages which we have left consider a recent 2003 incident in which an ann summers advert was banned it said for fashion and passion whip along to your local store with a photograph of a woman's back she's wearing a bra and thong and her hands are handcuffed behind her back the lingerie and sex toys company that targets female consumers and also supports charities fighting domestic violence said its adverts aimed to give women sexual confidence and always showed women in control of their sexuality one might conclude that the prejudice and ignorance of the betty page investigations still holds currency br br bettie's religious views are integral to the story just as the concept of sin is integral to christianity and contributes to the 'forbidden' nature of sexual enjoyment frequently prevalent in the uk and us as opposed to the more factual approach found in continental europe it could be argued the formulae of sin and redemption and being saved are even reflected in mating patterns that perpetuate traditional male dominance a policeman making a friendly but sexually motivated approach to bettie outside the courtroom offers to 'save' her from loneliness the knight in shining armour might be chivalrous but it also assumes a woman in need of rescue br br love it or hate it the notorious bettie page is an unusual and extraordinary film and a moral wake up call for those that heed it there is excellent ensemble acting and gretchen mol as bettie is remarkable as the whole film succeeds or falls on her powerful performance
<START> after seeing jeremy brett as sherlock holmes no actor should ever display such conceit as to imagine that he could ever come close to mr brett's portrayal of one of the most interesting characters in literature jeremy brett is sherlock holmes and in my opinion there can be no other the great actor basil rathbone is i must admit a close second but is still second one might make the argument that mr rathbone's screenplays were inferior to the absolutely top notch productions afforded mr brett and to this i would agree however when all is said and done jeremy brett will always and forever be the only actor to truly become sherlock holmes the book should be closed on this subject and we the public left to enjoy mr brett's unique performances br br bill rogers br br sonarman65 yahoo com
<START> if you have seen dogtown and z boys or have any interest in seeing the real non caricature real american side of america then riding giants will hit deeper than anything you've seen before br br this film is unreal a facile term if ever there was one but hugely appropriate if you can derive any form of literal meaning out of it it is a 100 factual documentary but with all the drama of an opera and the completely apparent sense of love expert and knowing instilled by stacy peralta's direction and narration this film expertly leads you from swell to big wave while keeping you completely enthralled in everything you are being given the privilege of seeing br br this film is a symphony crafted as well as beethovens 9th beginning beautifully with its prelude in hawaii tugging deeply on human emotion in santa cruz and finishing with uproar triumph and crescendo in laird hamiltons feats again in hawaii br br like classical music like beethoven's 9th ride of the valkyries or barbers adagio for strings this may be the only piece you like but it's worth it trust me
<START> this has got to be the cheesiest stupidest most retarded monster film of all time it's a complete joke that this even surfaced into theaters this is sort of like watching the loch ness monster in rural america this movie deserves to be thrown in a toilet and completely forgotten john carradine shame on you the people involved in this moronic pile of trash need to be lobotomized wait maybe i'm giving them too much credit i'm sure they were lobotomized before the filming how else can one explain the utter and sheer stupidity that this bucket of crap contains don't waste a minute of your life watching this don't even waste your time sending a review
<START> guys who ever even thinks about watching this movie has already got some disturbance going through their heads this movie has nothing to do with jack the ripper incase you thought its another b i mean e grade movie comprised of a bunch of horny teens in certain sex scenes being watched just before they get their spleens splattered on a nearby tree its not scary funny or amusing if you really feel like gory stuff with no plot then watch cabin fever at least the director did not fall asleep midway through directing this crap only watch this if you absolutely have nothing to do in life the only thing on tv is oprah winfrey crying on the tv set
<START> i think they really let the quality of the dvd production get away from them i rented this dvd from 2 movie stores and the second time i finally got it to play on the 3rd dvd player i tried br br anyone else have this issue it's really hard to give the film an un biased review after going through such a hassle to play it for one i've never seen a finnish horror film before so i was sort of bummed that the movie was done in english also since it's never made clear what is wrong with sarah she just came off as retarded and therefore i really just hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrific happenings go away
<START> this grainy film has a cult following and one of those word of mouth features you just had to see maybe hard to believe but there is a rural community in southwest arkansas fouke that knows the legend is true this tale is told in documentary style narrated by vern stierman and filmed in actual locations talking to actual folks involved the legend changes with the telling but during the late 60s and most of the 70s the surrounding area of fouke was visited by a bigfoot like creature that traveled along boggy creek long limbed with three toes and standing over 7 foot tall this hirsute creature periodically caused damage and frightened the 'bejeebers' out of most of the community i personally crossed over the small boggy creek bridge in 1974 and yes the hair on the back of my neck did rise of course it was about 1 a m in the rain by the time i arrived in shreveport i was laughing
