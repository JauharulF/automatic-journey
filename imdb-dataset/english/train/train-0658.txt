<START> whether you want to spend nearly 2 hours of your life watching this depends how you like your horror movies if you like them so god damn awful they're hysterical watch away jigsaw is without a doubt the worst movie i've seen in my life and i've seen 'long time dead' and i say this as a fan of the low budget horror gore genre and having seen a good few to compare it to i'm not even going to go into the specifics of what makes this movie was bad as it is the only good thing about it is it's so so terrible it's one of the funniest things i've seen in years if you can find this to rent cheap it's definitely worth watching if you were involved in making it shame on you o imdb need to introduce a 0 10 ranking especially for this movie it thoroughly deserves it
<START> when i first started watching this movie i was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train the interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring its not that i don't get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact it's just that in this film they are very boring if you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships you'd be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you it is realistic but you wouldn't go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie
<START> hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse 1976 and now only seems to do by the numbers hollywood thrillers br br this is very lightweight john grisham material crossed with the plot of a tv movie bullock is cass mayweather a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy and together they make an uncomfortable duo not good when two unbalanced college maladriots gosling and pitt decide to send them on a wild goose chase by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene br br fair enough but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks we also have to endure a several dull overly melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in cass's history then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff side log cabin where there's absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set oooh the atmosphere br br watch any episode of csi instead it's to the point and far more exciting
<START> rupert friend gives a performance as prince albert that lifts the young victoria to unexpected levels he is superb as we know queen victoria fell into a dark deep depression after prince albert's death and looking into ruper friend's eyes i understood the film doesn't take us to his death but to an incident that may very well could have cost his life an act of love i believed it or i should say him i believed what he felt was real nothing or anybody gets anywhere near the delicacy and profundity of friend's characterization emily blunt is good but i didn't believe for a minute she was victoria no real sense of period it may no have been her fault but her prince deserved the crown
<START> ardh satya is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema directed by the great director govind nihalani this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success even today ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india br br the film tells the real life scenario of mumbai police of the 70s unlike any police of other cities in india mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment br br amongst various police officers colleagues the film describes the story of anand velankar a young hot blooded cop coming from a poor family his father is a harsh police constable anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies incidences of his father's atrocities on his mother anand's approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors this leads to frustrations as he cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms bars also turning him to an alcoholic br br the spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system he is aware of the system of the metro where the police politicians are a inertly associated by far end his compromise towards unethical practice is negative finally he gets suspended br br the direction is a master piece thoroughly hard core one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty's house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic at many scenes the film has hair raising moments br br the practical approach of script is a major punch alcoholism corruption political influence courage deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today those aspects are dealt brilliantly br br finally the films belongs to the one man show om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly
<START> i was curious to know how critics responded to this rousing inspiring film so i went to rotten tomatoes and was dismayed to discover that the pompous peanut gallery that is our nation's film critics had given the film an average 43 or rotten rating br br all i can say is if this movie doesn't move you you have no heart it's interesting to note that the same film on the same website got a 74 rating from viewers br br not that the opinion of critics is all that important to me after all i can't think of a more useless overpaid profession some schmo gets paid to go to the movies what a tough life and does the same thing everyone else on the planet does forms an opinion but these chumps have a way of coming across like their opinion somehow matters more than yours and even worse they love to hate br br i'll grant you that this movie is old fashioned well except for the f bombs syrupy and a little predictable after all you know right from the beginning that cuba gooding jr portraying real life navy hero carl brashear is going to triumph eventually at every turn simply by the way he comes across determined and plucky strong willed and optimistic br br but his performance and that of de niro as billy sunday a composite character of several real life people are so strong so inspiring that you'll be on your feet cheering many of the film's scenes especially the courtroom climax you'd have to be a real stick in the mud not to be moved by these scenes like our nation's film critics michael rappaport is excellent as well as a sweet natured stuttering diving student that befriends gooding's brashear if anyone has seen higher learning this character totally redeems that character br br anyway this confirms what i've always felt don't listen to critics see this movie and get inspired
<START> i'm a big fan of troma but i can't figure out why they bought the rights to this movie it's so boring i felt like i was watching for 3 hours some where on the plot summary it says but what satan doesn't know he's stuck with annoying tourists well they didn't seem to bother him in the movie just me br br the only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays satan i like bad movie's but it was just boring
<START> this must be one of the most overrated spanish films in history its lack of subtlety and complexity and its total political correction make it really childish with only good bad characters the world is just not like this and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses dilemmas etc however what i hate most about this film is bola's friend's father the director tries to teach us a good lesson tattoo artists with shaved heads are not always bad guys in fact they can be better than the average looking dad wow this is like philosophy or something thank you achero i'll propose you for the nobel prize of literature
<START> this is a horrible movie all three stories are bracketed with a psychiatrist hypnotist line which is unnecessary and all the stories are bad the first is about wild wolves and some lady there are some things that don't make sense but the hypnotism thing makes up for that the second one with bad bill paxton as a maniac roommate should not be viewed by anyone the last one sadly the best is almost incomprehensible which i guess makes it better than the other garbage
<START> when 'my deja vu my deja vu' aired last season i was pleased scrubs i thought is doing something clever and unique in regards to the clip show concept instead of replaying footage they're replaying jokes in a self aware manner and i really enjoyed it br br i found it really unfortunate that i was wrong one season later they succumbed to that which almost all sitcoms inevitably do the clip show and it looked like it was put together by the work experience kid dr cox's shaved head shows just how lazy the editors were in putting it together as it doesn't appear again until 'my long goodbye' some 4 episodes later i can't imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well constructed sitcom who knows why it was slotted there it just seemed lazy and out of place reminding me largely of episodes that have aired within the past year br br three second clips jammed together with background music is a dvd extra for a very rainy day not an episode of prime time television
<START> this is a film that the mainstream market will probably never be able to access as it doesn't exactly give the viewer easy watching the story about troubled spike and his friend heaton is not exactly a friday night film yet it has its own unique edge and i found that it was entertaining there are moments of brilliance given that the film was shot on such a low budget such as when spike inhales the aerosol however i did not really understand the relationship between spike and heaton and to be honest it made me spend most of the film trying to work it out and also i did not like the fact that most of the film is spent with the two friends talking and not really much action it is a small film that is complex to watch and that is what makes it appealing
<START> i saw this movie in the theater when i was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial the commercial was great but it i found out later that it had every explosion or 'special effect' in the entire movie about 4 and even some that weren't in the movie there was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as i remember it was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people i guess my world of innocence ended that day when i found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies
<START> amateur no budget films can be surprisingly good this however is not one of them br br ah another brad sykes atrocity the acting is hideous except for emmy smith who shows some promise the camera direction needs serious reworking and no more hold the camera and run gimmicks either it just doesn't work the special effects are unimaginative there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time if you're going to rip off an ear please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood the scenery is bland and boring same as mr sykes other ventures and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal see the scenery comment br br did i mention the lack of any real plot or character development apparently the scriptwriter didn't br br whoever is funding this guy please stop i've seen some of his other home movies which i will not plug and they are just as bad normally a director will grow and learn from his previous efforts not this guy it's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker but anyone can be a hack br br definitely not even a popcorn film of course chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort br br award the worst ever military push ups in a film
<START> alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him br br the main subject of this bullock vehicle all the ideas almost everything was already in hitchcock's classic rope the two students who commit a gratuitous crime nietsche's philosophy and the clues that the boys disseminate the master was the first to transfer them to the screen and with an eighty minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force br br murder by numbers does not take place in a single room like the rope mind you and what a supreme originality it pits two cops against the evil youngsters and you would never guess it these two cops are very different actually bullock plays the part of woman living like a man and her partner chaplin is as shy as a clueless girlie the two boys' performances are not really mind boggling not as good as say that of edward norton in primal fear br br well you know rope was so good
<START> though i can't claim to be a comic book fanatic i have read my share so i guess i'm part of the audience of this film and i wasn't disappointed it does run out of steam near the end it's almost overflowing with ideas and it seems like lena olin one of my favorite actresses was left on the cutting room floor also a little of hank azaria's blue raja can go a long way still it's easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun all the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles especially william h macy as the straight arrow shoveler and janeane garofalo as the bowler and unlike some i found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier i also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys somehow it seemed appropriate
<START> this is a very unusual film in that the star with the top billing doesn't appear literally until half way in nevertheless i was engaged by the hook of the phantom lady curtis though competent as the falsely accused scott henderson looks a little tough to be be sympathetic towards perhaps he should have shaved his moustache and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the cops at least to some degree of his innocence while another commentator had a problem with franchot tone as jack marlowe i found his portrayal of the character to be impressively complex he is no stock villain superb character actor elisha cook jr is again in top form as the 'little man with big ambitions ' his drumming in the musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism this movie however is carried by the very capable and comely ella raines as the devoted would be lover of henderson carol richmond she definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of lauren bacall this is the first of her work i have seen and i am definitely inclined to see her other roles the rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent all in all a very satisfying film noir mystery which when viewed today fully conveys the dark and complex urban world it is intended to recommended 8 10
<START> insignificance is a far from great film from a stage play directed by nic roeg in the scheme of roeg's films this is above the level of most of his post don't look now work which is characterised by judicious use of theresa russell as lead actress she's actually very good here and far from the problem in other roeg films like bad timing and cold heaven as the actress who is marilyn monroe russell is very effective portraying her as a thoroughly depressive but likeable siren she plays well alongside michael emil as einstein who is excellent to say the least he looks the part admirably and while theresa russell doesn't look exactly like monroe she certainly is attractive enough to make the part ring true other players are adequate if not quite as arresting as emil and russell are a pretty workable intelligent script is directed well by roeg but certainly not brilliantly like walkabout or performance as in other later roeg films he tends to rely too much on vague insubstantial flashbacks that add very little to the film in many ways the film would have worked better as a shorter say 60 minutes more modest piece still a quite acceptable passable film at times quite excellent but somewhat lacking overall rating 1 2
<START> i'm sure that not many people outside of australia have ever heard of the legend of ned kelly i once saw a documentary about the man but that's the only time i once saw or heard anything about him and i guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face no one knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subject br br the movie tells the story of ned kelly's life the irish immigrant has lived in north west victoria all his life but has never been very welcome by the authorities the police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family when kelly is fed up with the way everything goes he forms a gang with his brother and two other men they start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days all this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen they are outlawed finally they take over a pub in glenrowan where they have a party with all the visitors waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up but the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmen br br it's very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false i guess nobody really knows because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth one camp says he was a hero some kind of robin hood the others will say he was an ordinary criminal a murderer and a thief i really couldn't tell you which of them is right perhaps both are but what i can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the same br br this movie was a nice addition to the documentary i once saw and i really enjoyed the performances of all the actors heath ledger orlando bloom naomi watts geoffrey rush are all actors who are pretty well known but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like i really enjoyed this movie and i give it a 7 5 10
<START> if movies like ghoulies rip off gremlins then hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like ghoulies these barely animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies which involve basically groteque characters' sex dreams oh joy but what that has to do with anything is anybody's guess except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica they show this down in the 8th circle of hell one suspects there's no real plot just goblins kill and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience
<START> i have to say i totally loved the movie it had it's funny moments some heartwarming parts just all around good me personally really liked the movie because it's something that finally i can relate to my childhood this movie in my opinion is geared more towards the young gay population it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up all the taunting name calling and not knowing is something i like most other young feminine boys will always remember and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay so i would definitely recommend seeing this movie probably shouldn't really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
