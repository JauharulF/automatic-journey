<START> i saw this in the theater when it came out and just yesterday i saw it again on cable this i was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is the whole bunch of characters are self absorbed narcisstic preeners worst of all it reinforces every negative stereotype about 20 something dating even as it purports to celebrate people finding themselves the nice guys finish last the jerky guys make out great the jerkiest guys do best the girls are all boy toy pushovers only one character wendy is seen doing anything remotely useful to society and she dispenses with her long saved virginity in a throwaway one night stand with a scumbag in a lushly filmed scene that we're supposed to think is romantic what this really is is hollywood's concept of young america permissive detached promiscuous conceited
<START> national treasure is about as over rated and over hyped as they come nicholas cage is in no way a believable action hero and this film is no indiana jones people who have compared this movie to the indian jones classic trilogy have seriously fallen off their rocker br br i can't really figure out what kind of target audience this film was shooting for maybe the pre teen audience will like it but i found it to be absolutely ludicrous i also can't imagine adults or young adults to find this to be that great of a film simply put it's just ok at best br br national treasure is unimagined and uninspired borrowing what it does have from the da vinci code i would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006 and passing on this nonsense br br the whole idea of being able to so easily steal the declaration of independence and run around all over washington dc and philadelphia with it while never damaging it once while fighting the bad guys and experiencing what is supposed to be non stop action is absurd i particularly loved the scene with the declaration folded in its tube laying in the middle of a busy road while cars whiz by it without damaging it oh brother br br reminded me of that episode of the brady bunch where they go to the amusement park and mr brady loses his architectural plans except that episode of the brady bunch was much better than this whole film br br the idea of such huge treasure that nobody believes exists being buried within a secret ruin of the us is outlandish literally there are thousand of undiscovered priceless items in this treasure trove yeah right ridiculous br br even worse the speed and accuracy of which cage finds and figures out what are supposed to be tough clues to these ancient riddles are pre posterous oh the humanity br br the performances by cage voight and the other actors in national treasure are as stiff wooden and flat as they come however when you're working with such lousy dialogue it's hard to fault the actor's 100 for that br br national treasure is an ok film to see once i can't recommend it beyond that and would definitely not purchase this over the top outlandish scavenger hunt of a mess br br rent it if you must see it first
<START> did anyone who was making this movie particularly the director spare a thought for the logic of the story line these are not mere plot holes but plot graves that become ever deeper as we lose any sympathy for the main character and his plight that is if you are kind enough a viewer to valiantly ignore the fact for most of the movie that the characters are either servants to the grave hole plot or boring and unlikeable or in the case of downey's hannah's characters apparently superfluous in pondering the reason for existence of downey's character's significant screen time in the movie i decided that either the director had liked his character and unnecessarily increased his screen time unlikley as the director didn't change anything else about the script he actually needed to or that his character was going to be sacrificed on the altar of bad plotting i'll leave you to guess which one it was to be br br i had to keep checking the cover of the dvd to confirm that this really was made by credible talents i cannot understand why robert altman would take this job surely he has some power to pick and chose actually i can't understand why anyone would take this script on except a first time director looking for the experience br br i suppose robert downey jr needed the money for his habit i suppose kenneth branagh wanted to try a southern accent i suppose robert duvall was only given a few pages of the script and thought the role in isolation sounded intriguing these are the only motivations i can see that would coerce good actors to take on roles in this movie as for robert altman plenty of effort has gone in on his part to making the movie look fantastic i found myself noticing how he had framed such and such a scene or used the bright orange float vests in another scene to draw the eye's movements or imposed a beautiful filter to create a particular mood i do not typically notice such things in movies since most movies i bother to watch to the end actually engage me for reasons of good story telling and interesting characters with understandable motives i watched this to the end only because some ridiculous element of optimism in myself kept looking at that dvd cover and being convinced that due to the talent involved there had to be some redeeming factor in this movie br br nice direction but that's not why i watch movies
<START> underneath the dense green glop of computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art and skill of ichikawa somegoro alas it got lost in all the goo the scenes of old edo with the courtesan drifting on the sumida rehearsing and acting in the nakamura za were all exciting and engaging taking you back to an interesting and rich era the action on the kabuki stage in which somegoro excels and excites was more enriching than any of the absurd high jinks that followed the skill the energy in the audience the colors of the sets were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance what a wasted opportunity one of the best kabuki actors alive and he gets lost in the dreck
<START> this is a bigger budgeted film than usual for genre director honda with more evidently elaborate sets Â though the special effects still have that distinctive cheesiness to them witness the giant bats and rodents on display it also utilizes a surprising number of american actors joseph cotten playing the visionary scientist looks ill at ease and frail but then his character is supposed to be 204 years old an innocuous richard jaeckel is the photographer hero while as chief villains we get cesar romero and patricia medina both essentially campy as i've often said i grew up watching english language films dubbed in italianÂbut hearing hollywood actors in japanese is another thing entirely br br latitude zero feels like a juvenile version of a typical jules verne adventure and is fairly entertaining on that level indeed it's preferable to honda's low brow variations on the monsters on the rampage formula because of the inherent quaint charm of the set up in this case the plot involves the kidnapping of a famous scientist by romero Â he was intended to establish himself in the underwater technologically advanced city devised by cotten to which the world's foremost minds are being recruited we're treated to plenty of silly battles between the rival subs but the most amusing scenes are certainly the raid on romero's cave Â in fact cotten doing somersaults and fending off men in rubber suits via flames and laser emitted from his glove must surely count as the nadir of his acting career the other elder in the cast romero is more in his element Â after all he had been the joker in the batman tv series and movie of the 1960s cotten has a scantily clad blonde physician on his team and is assisted by a hulking asian romero on the other hand is flanked by an oriental femme fatale Â who however ends up getting a raw deal for her efforts the girl's brain is eventually transplanted into a hybrid of lion and condorÂwhich is among the phoniest looking creatures you ever saw apparently a 2 disc set of this one from media blasters streets on this very day
<START> this god forsaken film is about three dumb millionaires who gather a bunch of people to play a deadly game and the winner gets a million dollars first of all the acting is terrible and the movie makes absolutely no sense at all it is not scary in the least bit it is so stupid that it made me laugh which is why it earned that 1 star the movie is not violent at all but is pretty sleazy and focuses mostly on the women's breasts the whole time and some of the characters are very annoying and whiny plus the monsters in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not scary that it just makes you want to throw something at the screen last but not least the ending is terrible i don't want to give it away in case you actually are strange enough to see this piece of junk avoid at all costs br br not rated but should be r for nudity profanity and mild gore
<START> i've been scolded and scorned by fellow christians for stating my disappointment with this movie i get hounded by statements like these i can't believe you didn't like it it was made totally by christians everyone donated their time and no one was paid for the movie it was made by a church and not hollywood we should spend our money on movies like this they only used 100 000 to make the film this is by a real church and christian school in georgia a preacher wrote and directed it so apparently the reason i should love this movie is simply because of the way it was made and the minimum amount of money used to make it and that is was made by christians that is all that is needed for me to love the movie br br look i got the movie without knowing anything about the background of the film i had never heard of it and had no idea other than football what it was about i watched it like i watch any other movie and was disappointed i was disappointed in the lousy editing and lame script i was very disappointed on the resolution after the climax don't worry there have been other cheap movies and other expensively made movies that have earned less respect from me it isn't about the making of the movie it is the end product br br the writer acknowledges that god doesn't say yes to everything we pray for in the way we want but he wanted to show by having faith god changes our lives that is true however god can change our lives and we're still infertile god can change our lives and we don't get a raise from our job god can change our lives and our car is still an old jalopy god can change our lives and our house is still stinky why didn't he portray that in the movie others voiced their concern to the writer director over the matter but apparently he was defensive br br i did not think the acting was horrible nor many of the landscape shots i like the idea of going to god and recognizing his awesome power and our weakness br br the writing and directing were very weak it is easy to distinguish this because many of the characters have no development all we really get from the coach's wife is she is not pregnant well until the end of the movie it seems as if there was only ball player that had the potential to have an interesting character and that was chopped to bits into i have a cripple father and i can't play football well but i'll kick the winning field goal even though i've never kicked a real field goal before another problem was the christian school itself umm i have worked for two christian schools went to one myself and have had many nieces and nephews in other christian schools all in all i've had some pretty close connections with about ten different ones none of the problems that i have seen in all of these schools were addressed i saw this as totally surreal in the movie about their school and wished they had shown the human factor it would have been nice to see a dose of reality and how god can work br br i will close by stating that every work either written or drawn or played on an instrument shares the artist's world view the world view that was shown to me in this movie consists of people who pray the right way win ball games get new cars conceive when they couldn't get a raise and get their house fixed all within a short time span i know i should love the movie simply due to the sincerity of the people who made it i think i should love the movie because it was well done and for no other reason
<START> but it'll make you wonder if we had any in the first place this movie is just as bad as any of today's horrible horror a man goes around ogling semi clad ladies trying to decide which one to kill so he can give his girlfriend a new body one scene involves a man staggering around and spurting all over the set for a full three minutes coating everything what what must be well over ten gallons of blood the movie also attempts to create a sense that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature but the movie is so badly done it's impossible for the audience to dredge up any feeling of shock or outrage aimlessly dark and unimpressively sinister this movie can't even get its own title straight the beginning credits say the brain that wouldn't die but the end credits list it as the head that wouldn't die
<START> the only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery this movie was long and boring the minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed how many times can his boys take the lord's name in vain in this film being from a presbyterian background it doesn't fit i wished paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly smirkish selfish story of paul brad pitt so norm becomes a teacher and paul becomes a compulsive gambler who norm wants to rescue but doesn't so what it's very uninteresting we see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by paul because of his native american girl that was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real 'wild western' what we only see is a sleepy town where the two minister's sons have nothing to do but 1 norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2 paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies i'd rather watch a show about fishing that that film again which will be never
<START> i watched this show on the basis of it being told it was reminiscent of david lynch's twin peaks a show which i adore the show quickly starts introducing us to the main characters and rather unusually the pilot episode is to me the best of the lot its extremely dramatic and really gets out the whole evil side of the show ready to progress throughout the rest of the season my one biggest criticism is i felt a little let down by the show probably not through its own fault as it got cancelled after a mere 1 season it seemed to display show much potential and it deserved a lot better treatment than it got the acting is excellent and this show has some of the best characters good and evil in it i have ever seen that are well developed in a short space of time there is the odd cheesy effect for the first 5 or ten shows which are a bit overly dramatic but this is rectified as the season progressed well worth a watch definitely something out of the ordinary
<START> fabulous costumes by edith head who painted them on liz taylor at her finest br br the sfx are very good for a movie of its age and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors even down to body type a rarity in movies of this vintage br br a cozy movie with splendid panoramas even when chopped down to pan and scan
<START> the invisible maniac starts as a young kevin dornwinkle kris russell is caught by his strict mother marilyn adams watching a girl tracy walker strip through his telescope cut to 'twenty years later' kevin dornwinkle noel peters is now a physics professor who claims to have discovered a way to turn things invisible using a 'mollecular reconstruction' serum however during a demonstration in front of his fellow scientists it fails they all laugh at him dornwinkle goes mad kills a few of them is locked away in a mental institute from which he escapes jump forward 'two weeks later' a group of summer college students discuss the tragic death of their physics teacher when the headmistress mrs cello stephanie blake as stella blalack says that she has hired a replacement yes you've guessed it it's dornwinkle the student don't take to him treat him like dirt however dornwinkle has perfected his invisibility serum uses it to satisfy his perverted sexual urges his desire for revenge br br co written directed by adam rifkin wisely hiding under the pseudonym rif coogan i wouldn't want my name to be associated with this turd of a film either the invisible maniac is real bottom of the barrel stuff the script by rifkin sorry coogan tony markes is awful it tries to be a teenage sex comedy horror hybrid that just fails in every department for a start the sex is nothing more than a few female shower scenes a few boob shots not much else i'm afraid the birds in the invisible maniac aren't even that good looking the comedy is lame every joke misses by the proverbial mile this is the kind of film that thinks someone fighting an invisible man or having henry jason logan a mute man trying to make a phone call is funny the invisible maniac makes the police academy 1984 1994 series of films look like the pinnacle of sophistication as for the horror aspect that too is lame it's also an incredibly slow it takes over half an hour before dornwinkles even becomes invisible dull predictable boring has highly annoying unlikable teenage character's br br director rifkin or coogan or whatever does absolutely nothing to try make the invisible maniac an even slightly enjoyable experience there's no scares tension or atmosphere as a whole the film is a real chore to sit through he does nothing with the invisibility angle just a few doors opening on their own is as adventurous as it gets there is very little gore or violence a bit of splashing blood a few strangulations the only decent bit in the whole film when someone has their head blown off with a shotgun unfortunately he was invisible at the time we only get to see the headless torso afterwards br br the budget must have been low i mean really low because this is one seriously cheap looking film dornwinkles laboratory is basically two jars on his bedside cabinet when he escapes from the mental institution he has all of one dog sent after him the entire school has about a dozen pupils two teachers the invisible maniac is a poorly made film throughout it's 85 minute duration i spotted the boom mike on at least one occasion lets just say the acting is of a low standard leave it at that br br the invisible maniac is crap plain simple i found no redeeming features in it at all there are so many more better films out there you can watch so there is no reason whatsoever to waste your time on this rubbish definitely one to avoid
<START> it's hard to criticize this movie because i dislike the story itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it think raising arizona with a mean streak the acting is passable but jennifer tilly is way over the top yet not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few hours of film darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out sorry
<START> usually i don't really like emma roberts so much but after watching nancy drew it kind of changed my mind the actors in the movies made the whole thing exciting and funny most of the time when you watch a mystery movie you can solve it before the middle of the show but in this movie it's like you are actually there the clues have to all fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime i am still amazed how she found it out the whole movie was really clever and the people who watched it with me loved the movie too the clothes were my favorite part of the movie it was so cute i don't think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out i give it a nine because the popular girls didn't really seem to have the part just right but they still make me laugh it was a really great movie and a great mystery i definitely recommend watching it
<START> i can sum this movie up using 20 words or less way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face see 19 words however i didn't completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to bump it up to two stars due to the fact that julie bowen is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the dvd right out from the machine and blowing it up with an m80 my advice take the 4 00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck or you may want to send me the 50 00 replacement fee you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice
<START> madhur has given us a powerful movie chandni bar in the past his next film page 3 was one of the worst movies of all time it apparently tells the story of some high class people in india after seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to star in a movie i felt like spitting and breaking the dvd coincidently i did the reason why was the movie contains scenes of child pornography and molestation i literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children very disturbing stuff there was no need to show the children fully naked one of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people british men in this movie i am shocked to know this film was a hit in parts of india otherwise super flop in uk usa and australia i'm from uk and this kind of stuff makes me sick shouldn't of been released in uk
<START> for a low budget movie this was really good i put this well above your average action b movie sean and corinne delivered in this movie and they didn't seem camera shy watch out for the cameos of jeanne and jared i didn't think that the producers would even consider that but the runner ups deserve that much br br i'll be looking forward to more of sean and corinne's involvement in the movie entertainment industry sean's character seemed very genuine and sexy corinne's character was pretty hard nosed and on point she connected well with the action sequences and executed with confidence it was a great idea to cast billy zane as the smart and witty villain his charisma on screen is always a pleasure to watch the chemistry between zane and sean's character was pretty good the action sequences weren't cheesy and seemed to connect throughout the movie of course there were flaws but that comes with the territory br br overall this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for tv sean and corinne did a good job considering that they are newcomers to the game i hope that jeanne jared and the rest of the next action star cast get their chance to also join their co stars in entertainment success br br final judgment
<START> being from canada i cannot say whether this film is original in the context of danish cinema unfortunately we here do not get to see many danish films in a year i also cannot comment on clausen's acting in the context of his other roles i personally found him quite believable a touching monstrosity of a man this jorgen as for the actor who played kenneth why would his participation in a tv show rule him out as an actor aren't we over such elitist attitudes international viewers unaware of his big brother participation will find him a fair actor br br in spite of the movie's faults the writing could have been subtler in some instances i do subscribe to what one could call the 'message' of the film namely art's essential role in everyday life art as healing force art as nietzsche said sanctifies the lie 'kunst heiligt die luege' it is a holy lie the wedding scene is fabulous in this sense a theatrical not religious wedding celebrating love and life as play
<START> may contain spoilers br br i bent over backwards to be fair to this film i knew it starred madonna i knew it lasted a whole week in theaters i knew it got a lot of bad reviews i wasn't expecting a deep and thoughtful examination of class culture and sexuality like we got in the italian original the benefit of the doubt lasted a whole ten minutes br br madonna plays a rich pretentious nit witted gorgon who goes on vacation with her henpecked husband and flippant friends the brunette woman is as bad as madonna exhibiting some really dumb facial expressions adriano giannini plays the ship's first mate who the madonna character delights in humiliating and treating like dirt in every scene they have together why is she such a bitch to him simply because the plot requires it so that later when the two of them get marooned on a deserted mediterranean island the tables will be turned and he will teach her a lesson just as inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and having abused each other for two thirds of the movie br br swept away is a silly simplistic superficial movie from beginning to end madonna gives a typically wooden performance there are many dumb scenes madonna singing and dancing atrociously at the demand of giannini a fantasy scene with madonna and a lot of scenes where he slaps her and kicks her in the butt guy ritchie does his stylish editing which is laughable here the film contains some of the worst dialog i've heard in a major movie in several years the ending is sappy and implausible it's basically the blue lagoon meets overboard minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter br br maybe madonna's ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress please give it up madge for our sake as well as yours this isn't her worst movie though that distinction still belongs to shanghai surprise she hasn't made anything worse than that yet
<START> when the bourne identity arrived five years ago i have to confess that i didn't think much of it at the time i was eleven years old so perhaps i was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario two years ago when the bourne supremacy arrived i thought it was a better movie than identity but still didn't think it was as good as i expected it to be judging by the trailers over the past two years i had been told numerous times that the bourne movies were amazing many a time i had to bite my tongue and not say what i really thought about the movies until two months ago i couldn't have given a damn about the bourne ultimatum i really had no intentions of watching it but then i decided to go back and re watch the first two before i came to any abrupt decisions so i went out and bought both the original movies and what a surprise it was to me when i was gripped by them identity i found the superior of the two but supremacy isn't far behind they're both slick action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that i have watched numerous times since i bought them because of this i was first in line today to see the bourne ultimatum and boy did bourne ultimatum not disappoint br br matt damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the bourne movies i'd seen him in the talented mr ripley but i never thought much of him in general however it appears he was born to play bourne pardon the pun throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes in this movie we see matt damon at his very best even better than he was in the departed and i thought he was one of the best things in the departed you really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything matt damon plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable the supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding joan allen was one of my favourite things in bourne supremacy here she excels herself her character is also very believable and she has some superbly acted moments towards the end of the movie julia stiles turns up again as nicky and finally we learn a bit about her character julia stiles is a very underrated actress and i think she deserves a lot more roles well decent roles than she gets david strathairn is a newcomer to this series as noah vosen he's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels he's definitely the nastiest character we've met and some of the decisions he makes are truly nasty strathairn relishes the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie special mention must also go to albert finney who makes the most of his all too brief screen time i will not say anything about the character that's best left as a surprise but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie br br the bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences this isn't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences good god no there's loads of them dotted all throughout the movies but running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline this storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie as i watched supremacy the night before i saw ultimatum it was nice because i could notice certain little parts that very final scene in supremacy in new york a lot more important that i ever imagined at the time won't spoil it for people but i recommend checking up on supremacy before you see ultimatum unfortunately though for a lot of people they will go to see ultimatum purely because of the action sequences this is the part where i should condemn such people and say they should see it for the storyline but i'd be lying if i didn't say that my favourite parts of the bourne series as a whole are the car chases the mini car chase in identity is one of my favourite car chases of all time well the action in ultimatum has to be the best of the bourne series in fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in moscow so in the duration of the movie we get numerous punch ups all very violent and shockingly brutal a bike chase that is absolutely amazing many foot chases which are even more amazing a thrilling car chase that is unforgettable and oh so much more but the highlight for me has to be the scene in waterloo station won't ruin it but for some reason had me gripped br br so any flaws for the movie in my eyes no but if you are not a fan of the bourne series or have not seen the previous two then i wouldn't recommend ultimatum for you the movie doesn't try to win over any new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best and just adds a nice bit more storyline and action sequences on top the bourne ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007 as a james bond fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the bond movies and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that while bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the bond series it is definitely nearly its equal
