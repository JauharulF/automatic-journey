<START> sunny a cocktail waitress in the d c area is a bit dim to put in mildly she drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple however she saves the life of a prominent arab by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official she charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks sniffing an opportunity presidential aides get her installed in the protocol department for the u s government even then she messes things up at times but she tries hard and learns a lot she even grabs the romantic attention of a state department official but is there another sinister plot in the making involving an arab man who wishes to take another wife a blonde one lol lol lol this movie features goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb as a fox as they say sunny learns her way around the jungle of the u s government very very well she even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings perhaps the arab community would be less than thrilled with this work but for those who like to laugh rent this today
<START> i have to be honest i was expecting a failure so bad because it really did sound like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money but that wasn't the case with this pretty funny sometimes odd movie i loved how they told the story of timon and pumba the story with simba and him having trouble sleeping was funny the jacuzzi bubble and when pumba leaves the bubbles stop it's all harmless fun good for kids and some adults i think this movie will last for a while because it is rather good for a straight to video and dvd movie while the movie does seem a little odd and kind of trails off toward the end it works 8 out of 10
<START> this movie is perfect for families to watch together it is a great film and it deserves more credit the special effects are stunning and spectacular everyone who has children should share this with theirs
<START> i am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad it reminds me of a c grade porn movie with one major difference no porn br br the story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable at the very least the pacing should have been picked up br br while i accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had he should have spent more time on the story or better yet get someone else to write it many of the action scenes were just pointless br br it was a complete waste of my time
<START> cuban blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way i actually watched it while sailing around cuba on a western caribbean cruise it details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father the majority of the film is the boy's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else there are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to a class a film with fine acting and directing this is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists it is a film about people and their lives their mistakes and their triumphs a good film worth watching several times annually
<START> this is a great movie but there could be more about soylent green there should be more scenes of what they do to people how people act in 2022 i think it would be neat to see if all this does happen in the year 2022 and beyond even if you still know what the secret is it is a great movie so go rent or buy this movie right now
<START> i can clearly see now why robin hood flopped quickly the first episode of it is probably the worst ever thing bbc has aired the opening scenes were about as intense meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting robin hood had no character and the sword fight was just laughable the worst part of the episode was robin hood snogging some cow clad in make up at the beginning of the episode how many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century nobody the series may have improved drastically since then but this first episode quickly put people's hopes down and is essentially a pile of cr p a great hero of england has been disgraced br br will you tolerate this i won't that's for sure unless the bbc start to understand what is a wise investment 3 10
<START> 'ninteen eighty four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted it is a very dark film and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself it is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self centred the film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places however despite the film's cleverness at portraying this idea the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across it seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story
<START> what starts out as generational conflict in this movie ends in understanding solemnity and grace the movie meanders through europe with the father and the young son cramped in a car over 3000 miles the cramping forces lifestyles beliefs and life skills to collide there's really no clear winner it all adds up in the end as experience experience of multiple layers of life for those interested in understanding islam this movie offers a generous and gentle outlook without being pushy about the agenda it's a coming of age story for the young son his dismissive and rebellious nature turning to openness for receiving more ways of life
<START> an unusual take on time travel instead of traveling to earth's past the main trio get stuck in the past history of another planet they beam down to this planet whose sun is scheduled to go nova in 3 or 4 hours that's cutting it close in some kind of futuristic library they meet mr atoz a to z get it ha ha and his duplicates it turns out instead of escaping their planet's destruction via space travel the usual way the inhabitants have all escaped into their planet's various past time eras mr atoz uses a time machine to send people on their way after they make a selection check out the discs we see here another trek prognostication of cds and dvds when mr atoz prepares the machine the atavachron what sis gallant kirk hears a woman's scream and runs into the planet's version of earth's 17th century where he gets into a sword fight and is arrested for witchery there's an eccentric but good performance here by the actress playing a female of ill repute in this time using phrasing of the time you're a bully fine coo witch witch they'll burn ye spock mccoy follow kirk but end up in an ice age 5000 years earlier br br kirk manages to get back to the library first the real story here is spock's reversion to the barbaric tendencies of his ancestors the warlike vulcans of 5000 years ago this doesn't really make sense except that maybe this time machine is responsible for the change even so spock mccoy weren't 'prepared' by atoz oh well it also seems to me spock was affected by the transition almost immediately he mentions being from 'millions of light years' away instead of the correct hundreds or thousands a gross error for a logical vulcan in any case spock really shows his nasty side here forget day of the dove and remember this side of paradise mccoy quickly finds out that his vulcan buddy will not stand for any of his usual baiting and nearly gets his face rearranged spock also gets it on with zarabeth a comely female who had been exiled to this cold past as punishment a couple of trek novels were written about spock's son the result of this union all these scenes are eye openers a reminder of just how much spock conceals or holds in it's also ironic that only a few episodes earlier requiem for methuselah mccoy was pointing out to spock how he would never know the pain of love and now all this happens kirk meanwhile tussles with the elderly atoz who insists that kirk head back to some past era you are evidently a suicidal maniac great stuff from actor wolfe last seen in bread and circuses it all works out in the end but like i mentioned earlier they cut it very close a neat little trek adventure with a definite cosmic slant
<START> in stand by me vern and teddy discuss who was tougher superman or mighty mouse my friends and i often discuss who would win a fight too sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like macgyver and the terminator or rambo and matrix but now it seems that we discuss guys like jackie chan bruce lee and jet li it is a pointless comparison seeing that lee is dead but it is a fun one and if you go by what we have seen from jet li in lethal 4 and black mask you have to at least say that he would match up well against chan in this film he comes across as a martial arts god br br black mask is about a man that was created along with many other men to be supreme fighting machines their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose they are invincible in some ways now that is the premise for the film but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes br br jet li is a marvel he can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do and that is what makes watching him so fun br br besides the martial arts in the film black mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that jet has with his co star the police officer they are great together but to be honest if anyone is reading this review they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department and the answer to that is a resounding yes lots and lots of gory mindless action you will love this film
<START> the lady from shanghai is weird even by the standards of its eminent director orson welles whose last hollywood film this was for many a moon it's a kind of post modern film noir made during the period when more conventional films of this type were quite popular and it concerns a happy go lucky irish sailor played by welles who falls in with a mysterious lady rita hayworth who was married to welles at the time and her crippled and probably impotent husband played with a brainy malevolent gusto by everett sloan a long sea voyage follows with welles in tow as bodyguard and the plot thickens when sloan's law partner glenn anders turns up and starts making trouble by giving odd speeches about suicide and other morbid topics that suggest that the man is on the verge of mental breakdown a murder plot ensues and all sorts of calamities follow for welles and his employers and at this point the story fuzzy and told at a leisurely pace thus far goes off the deep end and the last part of the film consists of brilliant directorial set pieces that seem to have been thrown in to give the movie some of the drive and urgency its story does not by itself possess and the result is a very watchable and often pleasing at all times incomprehensible mess br br it's hard to know what welles was trying to do with this film aside from maybe resurrect his career in hollywood by making a vehicle for his wife but self destruction intervenes as it often does with welles and miss hayworth has never looked less fetching that she is also cast as a femme fatale seems peculiar as aside from her beauty her most appealing trait as a screen personality was lovableness a quality she does not possess in this picture the director himself is strangely unappealing and hammy at o'hara the presumably easygoing sailor since welles for all his many gifts was not known as an easy man to work with this is a role that twenty or thirty years later sean connery or robert shaw might have been able to breath life into welles does not the most interesting performance in the movie is glenn anders' as grisby sloan's loony treacherous law partner anders works wonders with the part and is photographed to look bizarre while his scenes end on odd sour notes and are often choppily edited but for all this he manages to make grisby's derangement palpable and disturbing and anticipates in a genteel way the more flamboyant method actors of the fifties such as timothy carey br br there is a question that nags me about this film what was welles trying to say he was a highly talented and intelligent man and tended to make statements in his movies which whether one agrees with his world view or not were brilliantly put forth i think i have an answer or a partial one welles was summing up his movie career he had reached the end of his rope in the hollywood studio system he despised and he knew it the lady from shanghai isn't exactly a nose thumbing at the studio moguls of the day but i suspect that it is in its portrait of amoral rival big shot lawyers read producers expressing welles' opinion of the power brokers of hollywood that he presented himself as a rootless sailor is telling welles himself was certainly an inveterate traveler and he rarely lived in one place for long he was hired by a studio to provide it with a big prestigious film citizen kane which caused a firestorm of controversy from which he never fully recovered this may be the issue that dares not speak its name in this film which is to say welles' personal failure in not getting over the shock of his newness in the movie colony and his inability to deliver the goods as promised the mere fact of him turning up in hollywood like his mere presence in the film could not forestall disasters well beyond his control that he presented himself in the movie as an amiable naive outsider shows a lack of self knowledge on welles' part he was much more of an inside player than he let on and i imagine that he despised his knowledge of the worldlier aspects of life and himself for knowing so much
<START> there are those movies that are bad they are funny then there are those where you scream i want that one and a half hours of my life back thats pretty much what this is br br dean cain tries to be an actor but fails the sfx are really bad repeated scenes and rocks that look like falling paper and the fake plastic guns that have torches taped on them the split screen effect used to show multiple things happening at once is just terrible br br this movie cant even be used as one of those simple night entertainers its just that bad br br if i could go negative ratings i would
<START> i missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie but don't think watching it from the beginning would've made any difference i found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with the acting i remember patrick swayze and some of the other actors roy marsden for instance in outstanding roles but they all disappointed here due to a very weak script kind solomon's mines the very short part of the movie inside the mines was about as exciting as watching paint dry and i doubt that even a pre school kid would've been spell bound by watching the fight of the warriors the entire movie was reminiscent of a cheaply produced american tv series give me indiana jones any day
<START> i am a shakespeare fan and i can appreciate what ken branagh has done to bring shakespeare back for a new generation of viewers however this movie falls short of conveying the overall intentions of the play with the ridiculous musical sequences add that with alicia silverstone's stumbling over the dialogue reminiscent of keanu reeves in much ado about nothing and other poorly cast roles it all equals an excruciating endurance of viewing
<START> i watched this video at a friend's house i'm glad i did not waste money buying this one the video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie capricorn one the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow ups most not related to manned flight sibrel's smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast he edits in his own voice over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film his claims about radiation shielding star photography and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa the astronauts or american in general his science is bad and so is this video
<START> this movie has beautiful scenery unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must be a conflict this movie had none it spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it the picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling br br if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don't expect a story there isn't one
<START> the screaming skull opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it now there's a hook the story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to maybe it's just that the 1950's didn't have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane but then again when i first saw house on haunted hill as a nine year old it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way i'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era br br don't get me wrong the film is not terrible it just seems to get tedious at times but there's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished whitlock home and the gardens and pool are a nice touch for me the best played out scene involves eric whitlock john hudson going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull he just wades right in clothes and all in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener director alex nicol in a dual role it makes you wonder who the real dimwit was br br in it's own good way perhaps the most shocking thing about the film how about that neat roadster the whitlock's make their first appearance in gull wing doors in 1958 that at least made me jump out of my seat
<START> wow simply awful i was a fan of the original movie and begrudgingly sat through part 2 3 was and improvement 4 5 and freddy's dead were pretty bad but nothing is as bad as freddy's nightmares freddy acts as a rod serlingesq host of this anthology series br br i can accept how freddy became one punchline after another but at least in the movies the appeal of freddy carried the movies but here these were so poorly made they looked like high school productions of a horror series the poor actors if you really want to call yourself that after doing this show were obviously exactly what they paid for i'm nearly certain this was a stopping point for two types of actors ones just starting on the hollywood ladder brand new willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week or seasoned actors on their way down the hollywood ladder willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week br br i half expected dana plato to guest star but she was already dead by the time this was in production br br to paraphrase nancy's line in the original elm st what ever you do try not to fall asleep watching this
<START> eleven different film makers from different parts of the world are assembled in this film to present their views and ideas about the wtc attack this is one of the best effort you will see in any film films like this are rarely made and appreciated this film tries to touch every possible core of wtc here are some of the most important stories from the film that makes this film so unique br br there is the story from samira makhmalbaf iran where somewhere in iran people are preparing for the attacks from america there a teacher is trying to educate her students by informing them about innocent people being killed in wtc massacre then comes a story from youssef chahine egypt where a film maker comes across face to face conversation with a dead soldier in the wtc attack and a dead hard core terrorist who was involved in wtc attack then we see a story from idrissa ouedraogo burkina faso where a group of five innocent children's sees osama bin laden and plans to kidnap him and win the reward money from america then we see the story from alejandro gozalez inarritu mexico where you see a black screen and slowly you see the real footage of wtc buildings coming down and the people who are stuck in the building are jumping out of it to save their lives the other most important story is from mira nair india where a mother is struggling to get respect for her dead son whose name is falsely trapped in wtc massacre after september 11 attack our heart beat automatically starts pumping if we hear two names anywhere in the world first is world trade centre and the second is osama this film totally changes our perception and makes a strong point by claiming something more to it br br i will definitely recommend this movie to everyone who loves to have such kinds of home dvd collection definitely worth every penny you spend but please don't expect anything more apart from films in this dvd there is of course filmographies of the film makers but no extra features
