<START> said a couple exiting the movie theater just as i was entering to watch this hmm not a good sign but who knows different strokes for different folks after all well nope they were being kind godard has released work that is passionate contempt entertaining band of outsiders sometimes both my life to live this is just dull intellectualism that grates on the nerves pretty quickly during my showing literally half of the audience had walked out by the end of the film if only i had been so wise
<START> one of the most beautiful movies ever made in ex yu story is very familiar to people in ex yul because generation after war used to live in the same way people in the west cant imagine how political situation in our country affect people the plot is in the 50 when josip broz tito said no to the sssr and politbiro and because of that our borders becomes open for western influence but in a country were people didn't had much money jeans was only ideal and friendship was everything the friendship between for young people an a girl was so strong that after 40 years of their emigration from yu is still alive they get together after all this years on ester s funeral and they start to remember of their childhood before their went to the emigration and become successful people
<START> i must have seen this a dozen times over the years i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b w on the local pbs station br br i bought a dvd set for the children to see and am making them watch it they don't teach history in school and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century it expands their critical thinking br br impartially with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why it details what lead up to the war and the actual war br br buy it for your children along with alistair cooke's america watch it with them and make them understand you'll be so glad you did
<START> they did it and boy did they do it fantastically or what the bbc finally brought the doctor back to our screens on a saturday evening where he belongs and they did it with style br br episode one rose one of the strengths of the new series is russel t davies as a writer and executive producer he's a fan of the show and knows what the other fans want but also is an experienced writer in his own right so knows what other people want another strength as perfectly shown here in this first episode is billie piper and her character of rose tyler finally the doctor's companion gets a credible back story and a strong character also nice to see the return of the autons a nice nod to the classic series there br br episode two the end of the world in the start of this double bill to show off the tardis' strengths we end up in a story where special effects is everything they now have the technology to create real believable environments and monsters no more rubber suits of sorts also the hints at the end of this episode regarding the new doctor's past very intriguing to kill off all the time lords and make him the only one br br episode three the unquiet dead we've had the future now lets have the past the first non davies written episode is a little flat in some places but this is made up for by simon callow's charles dickens and the sudden twist in the plot when it is revealed the pitiful gelf are not so pitiful after all br br episode four aliens of london the consequences of the doctor's actions are fully explored in this series not least with the repercussions of rose running off with him also we have our first cliffhanger not the best of ones admittedly the slitheen are an interesting villain though they can look too cgi for their own good br br episode five world war three the second part of this story about the slitheen suffers mainly from the same problems of the first also the clips from the next episode coming up at the end of the current episode are annoying and spoil it for people br br episode six dalek yes we've had the future the past and the present ish but now we get to the good stuff the return of the doctor's arch nemesis here i think we can complement christopher ecclestone he was brilliant as the doctor and no more so then in this episode where we see the pain on his face as he recollects the time war and the alien nature of him as he almost turns into a dalek himself br br episode seven the long game really only a story to act as a prologue for the series finale saved by simon pegg as the smarmy editor and tamsin grieg in an amusing cameo the media are controlling us that's never been done before has it br br episode eight father's day this is a great episode full of human emotion and heartache for rose and the true consequences of what happens when you really muck up history full marks to billie piper here br br episode nine the empty child i don't find this kid very scary sorry but i don't it's a good episode though but the cliffhanger still could have been better it's those next time bits that spoil them john barrowman is introduced here as captain jack the dashing conman he's a good actor who's been around for a while but only seemingly noticed now br br episode ten the doctor dances part two of this ww2 story very well made in historical context terms a nice upbeat ending though a little confusing perhaps for younger viewers when the mummy is revealed br br episode eleven boom town probably the weakest of the series but that doesn't mean its bad a nice return for the slitheen and also an interesting character study of the doctor and rose br br episode twelve bad wolf this starts off quite silly with some good hearted humour and cheeky fun making at popular tv shows over her in blighty things turn deadly serious quickly though and the revelation at the end is the best cliffhanger in the series br br episode thriteen parting of the ways goodbye christopher ecclestone a fantastic doctor in so many ways david tennant is having to really work his socks off to be as good as him the regeneration scene at the end is beautifully played oh and the daleks are back in the extreme god bless cgi because they'd never be able to pull this off normally br br overall brilliant 9 10
<START> the lady from shanghai is well known as one of hollywood's most troubled productions welles' original cut was taken away by the producers and cut to ribbons this made the already muddled mystery story even more difficult to keep track of they post dubbed a good amount of his dialog because of the density of the irish accent and the dubbing is all too apparent and poorly done most disastrous of all welles and his on screen and real life leading lady rita hayworth were falling apart in their relationship and their tumultuous chemistry comes through on screen br br fortunately this is all overcome by just how fantastic orson welles' direction is he makes the film incredibly stylish and atmospheric every scene just seems to be breathing down your back from the screen also the characters and scenes are so bizarre they border on dreamlike and surreal this sense of weirdness elevates scenes that are often found in these films such as the courtroom sequences in the middle i typically find courtroom dramas a bore but welles' direction and quirky touches make them just as fascinating as everything else the ending at the carnival reminds one of david lynch almost br br the acting here is also very good despite their failing relationship welles and hayworth both give decent performances their interactions however are just a bit lacking everyone else is superb and delightful to watch though especially everett sloane and glenn anders the lady from shanghai obviously has its problems but its worth watching just to see one of cinema's masters at his finest 8 10
<START> as someone who was staggered at the incredible visuals of hero i was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines but better it also featured an actress i like ziyi zhang well i was disappointed on both counts i bought the dvd of this film sight unseen and that was a mistake it was not better br br i realize these flying through the air martial arts films are pure fantasy but this story is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief a blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents sorry that's going a little far also the major male character 'jin takeshi kaneshiro was so annoying with his dialog stupid look on his face and stupid laugh that he ruined the film too br br despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes this story to me just didn't have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning this film is no hero of mine
<START> i really enjoyed this movie it succeeded in doing something that few movies do now it provided family values while entertaining me nancy drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls to look up to the little girls i was with throughly enjoyed the movie and kept talking about nancy as we walked out of the theater the movie has relatively few problems for families and i don't think parents will get bored sitting in the theater no it won't win an oscar and it did not showcase magnificent special effects or even provide a horribly spooky mystery but it entertained me and it stood true to the the spirit of the books i would definitely recommend this movie to anybody with a young girl she will love it or any fan of the books you will not be disappointed
<START> van dien must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this ludicrously poor film as indeed must every single individual involved to be honest i am rather embarrassed to admit i watched it from start to finish production values are somewhere between the original series of 'crossroads' and 'prisoner cell block h' most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot as for the acting performances if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable 'story' to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde boiler has come to be getting spit roasted by a couple of blokes with moustaches you will have some idea of the standard of acting in 'maiden voyage' worse still you can't even fast forward to the sex scenes because there aren't any an appallingly dreadful film
<START> my friends and i rented this from blockbuster because we saw nana visitor's name on the box this movie is a travesty i hope she negates from her cv br br the plot was lose and flaccid the acting was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts the movie made no sense whatsoever the rough plot of an alien parasite species that infects humans has been done many times by films with much better scripts than this for example invasion of the body snatchers and the faculty br br if you ever have the misfortune to come across this movie i suggest you burn it br br how it classes itself as a horror movie when there was no use of fear suspense gore terror or any of the usual horror film techniques i don't know however if you still find yourself wanting to watch this film i suggest you have a lot of sugar before hand so you can find parts of it funny
<START> as i drove from skagway alaska to dawson city yukon a couple of years ago and was impressed with the scenery i cannot help but wish that this film even though it has beautiful color and scenic views would have been shot in the actual location jasper in the canadian rockies is a magnificent place but still not the real place where the film takes place when the story moves to dawson that is when i feel anthony mann who used the outdoor locations so well could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place james stewart here is again a man fighting within himself one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered ruth roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps corinne calvet is the nice girl mann is excellent directing the shootouts but the high point of the film is how well he does in the outdoor scenes he uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery the predominating white like it was with the greens in the naked spur and the browns in the man from laramie like all of the mann stewarts this is a traditional western with a difference in the elaboration of stewart's character which is more complex
<START> my sincere advice to all don't watch the movie br br don't even go near to the theater where this movie is being played even a glimpse of it is bad for health serious no jokes it's 3 30 am in the morning and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe four hours damn i am proud that i survived after all of it if this is called survival br br i am highly frustrated annoyed disappointed it was sheer waste of time money went in drain no plot hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night rubbish movie br br happy republic day to one and all
<START> director otto preminger reunites with his laura stars dana andrews and gene tierney in this rough and ready to rumble film noir where the sidewalk ends this film is complete with a well written crime story with interesting characters unexpected turns and clever dialogue and an eye pleasing look with great camera movements and dark and gritty film noir lighting dana andrews stars as detective mark dixon part mobster and part cop who has a reputation of being too physically tough with criminals after one case sees dixon in search of suspects and answers he gets far more involved than he wanted br br dana andrews is terrific in his role tough and edgy andrews' dixon is ready to knock any and all off their heels if they get on his bad side he's the perfect film noir anti hero he's not very nice all the time but we still root for him gene tierney does a solid job in her role as much as it is being a sweet shoulder for dixon there might not be too much to tierney's role but she certainly goes above and beyond what others could do with the role knocking every member of the audience out with her kind smile gentle manner and twinkle in her eye the supporting cast isn't too bad either karl malden being the most memorable stepping in and giving a good supporting performance as lieutenant thomas where the sidewalk ends is no laura but it is a great film noir filled with great characters story and picture
<START> where was his critique of democratic administrations as well as republican ones after all he did serve for 17 years in a body of government where his influence was unwaivering oh i forgot about the 8 years he was the 2nd in command of the most powerful nation on earth the film is happy to show shots of a young senator gore asking why a nasa scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper but fails to ask about the complicity of clinton gore in global warming probably too close to an election year or maybe it would hurt the chances for hillary in '08 either way he's a political coward and party man to the bitter end he offers no criticism of consumerism no criticism of capitalism no way to is the history of the industrial development which has led us to this point in time br br in the end this film was much more about mr gore himself than about any real problems our environment faces mr gore if you really wanted to make a campaign film shorten it call it what it really is
<START> perhaps we can arrange a meet where are you now i'm sitting in my office i doubt that why would you doubt that if you were in your office right now we'd be having this conversation face to face br br bourne remains street tough and elusive only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy conversation is macho to the point with only shards of bond type gallows humour its all about the action br br the feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so well a scene set in waterloo with a guardian journalist does this to great effect there is no meeting of worlds you are in it or just a superfluous body br br if the shaky cam doesn't annoy you too much enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going
<START> blonde and blonder was unfunny basically it was a rip off girl version of dumb and dumber but less funny and they used too much background noises and music way too much background noises and music if you ask me it starts out immensely boring and totally inane it doesn't pick up pace anywhere soon and i was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried on maybe the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutes i found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it neared the end but that was the only part also i couldn't help but like pamela anderson and denise richard's characters a little even though this movie didn't get any laughs from me it kept my attention i wouldn't say to completely avoid this movie but there are thousands of better films for you to spend your time and money on than blonde and blonder
<START> this sweeping drama has it all top notch acting incredible photography good story it is often compared to braveheart because both movies take place in historical scotland even though i love braveheart i think this is the better of the two films jessica lange gave an incredible performance should have been nominated for an oscar liam neeson is fantastic in the title role tim roth plays one of the most evil despicable characters in film history he was nominated for an oscar john hurt is excellent as lord montrose another dislikeable character i am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that john hurt can play this is a story of a dispute over money between rob roy and his clan and lord montrose rob roy is a self made man who will not solve his problems with montrose if it violates his sense of honor montrose who inherited his title has no sense of honor and that is basically what this story is all about honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility this movie is very entertaining it should appeal to all it has romance action beautiful scenery and has a exciting plot one of my favorite films
<START> yes this a b grade horror but at least the producers directors and cast does not pretend this flick is manna from heaven the plot is corny a psychotic serial killer on his way to execution is splashed with genetic acid turning him into a snow man the snowman a k a jack frost then goes on a murdering rampage to find the small town sheriff that finally arrested him with a limited budget the crew had to make do with limited special effects most of the money appears to spent on the snowman's costume particullary difficult shots are managed by cartoons or pan away shots shots where the camera moves away to disguise the details br br this is no kid's movie and should not be confused with disney movie of the same title if you do not let your children watch pg 13 movies alone than parents should not let their kids watch this movie this movie has two claims to fame 1 the beatiful shannon elizabeth american pie did her first major movie role the scene where jack frost attacks shannon elizabeth is worth watching a few times 2 this movie has the worst snowman joke ever the joke is so bad that the directors credit the joke teller in the credit list
<START> whipped is one of the most awful films of all time it is a mean hateful piece of garbage that had me forcing myself to stay in the theater more than any other movie of 2000 besides maybe the grinch it is not as people have called it an insightful portrait of modern relationships that would be a little film called high fidelity whereas that movie was honest and sympathetic whipped is hostile cynical misanthropic cinematic poison avoid this like so many plagues unless you want to see how truly bad a comedy can get
<START> anyone giving this movie a good review obviously must have had something to do with its creation this movie is a painful suckfest the acting is stiff the stock generic soundtrack is laughable the direction is bland and strangest of all the teacher really isn't all that attractive making the student's blatant advances all the more awkward the creative minds behind this trash should disband and spread out to prevent further displays of such concentrated craptitude i'm certain that some starving kids in africa could have used the money squandered on this project hell the funds would have also seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crack addict at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it for the sole reason that it didn't give me a terminal illness i'll give this film a two
<START> along with south pacific guys and dolls is for grown ups it is sassy sexy and full of men being men and women being strung along br br there is an energy and drive that makes this stand out from the pack the strength of jean simmond's performance and the charm of a young brando and an already masterful sinatra add much to the overall feel and look of the piece br br guys and dolls wins as it is unashamedly what it is an mgm musical br br still good to look at and listen too with great tunes and dance numbers it will remain one of the classics of 20th century cinema and be watched with pleasure for years to come br br warmly recommended
