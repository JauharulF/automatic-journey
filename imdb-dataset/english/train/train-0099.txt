<START> i've tried to watch this show several times but for a show called that '70s show i don't find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the '70s the decade in which i grew up of the episodes i have seen most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period take away the novelty of supposedly being set in the '70s and the show is neither interesting nor funny br br if you're looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in america in the '70s in my humble opinion you can do no better than the wonder years
<START> the king maker will doubtless be a success in thailand where the similar but superior 'the legend of suriyothai' set box office records the film directed by lek kitaparaporn after a screenplay by sean casey based on historical fact in 1547 siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest pedestrian scripts and story development on film br br the event the picture relates is the arrival of the portuguese soldier of fortune fernando de gamma gary stretch whose vengeance for this father's murderer drives him to shipwrecked captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in ayutthaya in the kingdom of siam where he is purchased by the beautiful maria cindy burbridge with the consent of her father phillipe john rhys davies a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses there is a plot to overthrown the king and fernando and his new siamese sidekick tong dom hetrakul after some gratuitous cgi enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness are first rewarded by the king to become his bodyguards only to be imprisoned together once queen sudachan yoe hassadeevichit reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover lord chakkraphat oliver pupart to take over the rule of siam yet of course fernando and tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families tong's wife and children and fernando's now firm love affair with maria with the expected consequences br br the acting with the exception of john rhys davies is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp the predominantly thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog making us wish they had used their native thai with subtitles the musical score by ian livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old tv soap operas but if it is visual splendor you're after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching it is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions it is just the basics that are missing grady harp
<START> one of the best comedy series to ever come out of britain mark gatiss reece shearsmith and steve pemberton are terrific actors and performers who seem at home with drama as they are with comedy ably supported by their writing partner jeremy dyson they have peopled the series with the most memorable characters of recent years little britain pales into insignificance as a poor imitation of their ideas consistently original and groundbreaking i am sure that as many people hate these series as love them but i am equally as sure that no one could have no opinion on log i have yet to see the feature length movie but i have heard good things and bad things so i will reserve judgement the original radio series from which log came was as innovative as the tv series became i don't know whether the tv series made it to the us but i would be fascinated to see how american audiences found the weird englishness of the humour
<START> my friends and i rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in awhile the movie is not supposed to be funny at all but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism whatsoever first phillippe i forget what his character is called and i don't really care uses his regular employee id to go through all the top security terminals not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when his enormous efforts culminate in his finding the so scary lego room which hosts the super computers this is plain funny the tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely spoilt by the childish looking room the ending like all else is very very very cheesy especially when the bad guy's lawyer shows up 'right on time' anyway this movie is a good laugh if you need something to make fun of definitely see it
<START> ok here is how i do this i grade movies on 10 components each component will inherently start with 5 points it can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0 br br mood action romance comedy drama suspense i give this component 10 points it had a perfect balance of all five aspects the action was fun and exiting the romance was not overdone but still very emotional and moving i laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still i was captivated by the fantastic drama and riveting suspense br br plot i give this component 10 points i thought all the good fairy tales had already been told i found my self sitting in the theatre returned to my childhood and in that instant i again believed in unicorns wicked witches and falling stars that make dreams come true br br cinema photography i give this component 8 points while the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles i found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camera br br fx i give this component 10 points i love that they used c g i sparingly the epic scenes were believable the magical powers were frighteningly realistic all in all less is more and this had it all cast i give this component 10 points no names and seasoned actors alike the cast was amazing michelle pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked charlie cox made tristan come to life claire danes gave emotion to the stars and i will never look and robert de niro the same again br br acting i give this component 10 points even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection once again i will never look and robert de niro the same again br br character development i give this component 9 points this felt a little rushed and i think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice br br dialogue i give this component 10 points the dialogue was smart witty funÂ even the mush had good dialogue br br score i give this component 7 points i can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie i am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable br br ending i give this component 9 points almost perfect ending i feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced while others could have been more subdued but no threads were left untied br br total 93 buy the dvd hel yes see it in the theatre most definitely bottom line excellent movie for everyone epic i strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre i know i'll be going back for seconds
<START> terrible film made on a budget of about 9 99 very obvious miniature sets used poor acting and an awful storyline concerning aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship the film contains some blood not enough to disturb and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands yes you read that correctly br br one saving grace was a song performed at the talent show how's that for irony by a punk new wave band that i think was called i'm a heat seeking missile other than that this is not worth your time not even on a so bad it's good level watch if you are into cheesy alien films but anyone else should steer clear br br rating 1 out of 10
<START> this was playing at our theater in amsterdam and the film we wanted to see was sold out so we went to this not knowing anything about it other than it was a documentary about the planet we were very happy at our misfortune as this was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the inhabitants of earth this film has some of the most breathtaking photography i have ever seen in a film and took me places from deserts to oceans to rain forests and displayed things i have never seen in a film tv or book earth is a film that every student should see before they become jaded i will encourage my niece to see this film since she will be inheriting the planet we leave her this is also a film to see on a theater screen or a very big television since the photography is so powerful and exotic
<START> one star for the plot one star for the acting one star for the dubbing into squeaky voiced american five stars for monica broeke and inge maria granzow with their propensity for taking all their clothes off and ten out of ten for the divine emmanuelle bÃ©art two years before she made 'manon des sources' bÃ©art also undresses a couple of times but even fully clothed her presence is enough to make this film eminently watchable watch out for the scene where she tells her friend about the three first times for a girl it's corny but still far more erotic than the rather laughably choreographed love scenes featuring broeke granzow and patrick bauchau incidentally the cinematography is not great the stills for the closing credits are a better indication of what david hamilton is capable of
<START> notable because of it's notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous maruschka detmers takes her young lover's penis from his trousers and into her mouth even without this moment the film is a splendid if slightly disturbing passionate and blindingly sexy ride detmers puts in a great performance as the partly deranged insatiable delight wandering about her flat nude dressed partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love sexual passion philosophy and politics for me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fiancÃ© is released whilst fellow terrorists are released she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else as she weeps beautifully of course
<START> this is seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen i love japanese movies and i think another film by the same director electric dragon 80 000 v is a masterpiece i really wanted to like this movie asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing but i couldn't find anything entertaining about it br br the movie takes forever for nothing to happen and the effects the director used like the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind bogglingly slow and the actors were heinously overacting a lot of the boredom was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary like an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he doesn't worship anything this added nothing to the plot a fellow japanese film buff and i were both checking the time constantly we couldn't believe this film was as terrible as it was and the finale was awful i thought the director would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this but sadly i was mistaken
<START> following directly from where the story left off in part one the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such in direct contrast to the first feature part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country to cheÂstruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties the change of setting isn't just aesthetic from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle yet as che would go on to say himselfÂsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thatÂa struggle while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that part two takes a much more refined callous and bleak segment of che's life and ambition and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible easy to grasp manner br br while the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible this somewhat distant cold approach to telling che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off indeed i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manÂif anything the entirety of che taken as a whole delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago excuse the ironic contrast che is a slow moving reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who Âarguably conducted the whole thing br br yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn't feel too disjointed from its predecessor but does enough to give it its own reference points here the basic structure of part one is echoed backÂthere's the initial struggle the battles the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement yet as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know part two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming and disquieting note this difference in combination with the similarities to part one make a compelling and memorable whole by all means both could be digested one their own and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such and enjoyed as they are but taken as one statement che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve br br indeed everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building realistically structured combat scenesÂthe drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible but with a feature such as this part two once again proves that avoiding such elements don't necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged in fact upon writing this review i was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one and title the review as a whole yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively br br with that said i cannot rightfully decree whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime but upon viewing both segments i can at least attest to each part's ability to do just that with a reflective intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie's characters without drawing attention to themselves che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor but this time with a tragic but uplifting reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film br br a review by jamie robert ward http www invocus net
<START> well if it weren't for ethel waters and a 7 year old sammy davis jr here billed without the jr rufus jones for president would be one of the worst representations of african american stereotypes i've seen from the early talkie era and wouldn't have been worth seeing because of that ms waters is excellent here singing am i blue and underneath our harlem moon while mr davis shows us how his childhood experience in showbiz prepared him for his superstar status as an adult he's so good tap dancing here that for awhile i thought he was a little person with decades of experience so if you're willing to ignore the negative connotations here rufus jones for president should provide some good enjoyment p s this marks the fourth time today i've seen and heard the song i'll be glad when you're dead you rascal you performed on film this time by davis must have been a very popular song about this time
<START> well you take o j simpson as a all american soldier turned all american bus driver who decides to rescue his passengers on his own just incase no one else is going to and arte johnson in an absolutely straight role as the tour guide who doesn't know what to do but doesn't want to admit they are in trouble and combine it with lorenzo lamas as one of three baby faced bad boys who intend to kidnap an heiress and leave a busload of people to die on the dessert and you have got to have action plot twists and a lot of drama everyone was good but seeing lamas as the baddest of the bad boys really blew my mind he was much too believable as the overbearing bad guy who not only wanted to kidnap the heiress but rape the women and humiliate the guy who tried to stop him this was evidently long before he cultivated his good guy image and believe me a 20 year old lorenzo in tight jeans you really don't want to miss
<START> this is one of those films that i could only sit through once charlotte henry is fine in fact all the actors were fine the problem was in the script the dialog the direction the editing the sets and the special effects granted this was 1933 but it really creaked part of the problem is that actors like richard arlen gary cooper w c fields and cary grant are not recognizable there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming the movie just clumped along with no cohesion much of lewis carrols spirit humor and continuity are missing what a pity it's such a great book i would recommend disney's 1951 version
<START> it has been almost 5 years since the release of this stylish action flick i have watched this movie almost 10 times and it a great effort by gautham from my perspective i feel this movie is virtually flawless surya as acp anbuchelvan no doubt classy jyothika played her role as maya very well the character suits her very well the character that caught movie goers attention was pandia jeevan played the role of pandia very well brutal and fearsome jeevan deservedly received the best villain award in the itfa 2004 the supporting cast of daniel balaji devadharshini and other performed well br br racy screenplay perfectly timed dialogues and brilliant narration by gautham the soundtrack by harris jeyaraj are all chart busters while the bgm suits the movie very well cinematography by r d rajasekhar is rich peter hein choreographed the stunts well anthony's editing is precise above all kaakha kaakha is a perfect cop film filled with right doses of action and romance br br even some hollywood film cant compete with kaakha kaakha undoubtedly
<START> this movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts i love the final when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life but it's completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right is jut for two so what are the other persons doing there the movie embrace you to a new life to experiences to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams also shows you the life itself hard like it is but gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need hope this comment works for you the movie it did worked well for me i bought the movie by the way take care
<START> this film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film the plot is somewhat lacking but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference this is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please as a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining and with major stars like cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas how could you go wrong br br comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued and is very difficult to imitate a good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this film the money pit with tom hanks and shelley long despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments achieving true comedic dialog is an art
<START> and you can look at that statement in different ways by the way first of all it's a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes your wildest imagination doesn't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here entire parts of this movie are just plain sick disgusting offensive brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out now i love horror movies and i am very 'pro violence' but i do think that it has to lead somewhere is that too much to ask cradle of fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts the movie contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story this results in endless showing of torture murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common not very informative if you ask me and yet it has to be said the basic plot idea surely has potential it's about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial personally i think that is an interesting topic so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever br br secondly the whole production of this movie was a mess they didn't have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts tons of it the acting performances are a joke and some of the worst i've ever seen any other special effects besides the make up looks very amateurish like that attempt to a realistic car crash for example there's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere not even an attempt to build up one br br cradle of fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least with the presence of death metal icon danni filth from the band cradle of filth get the link this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this and then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing bah i can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you're easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind for every self respecting horror fan this movie is an insult
<START> i have seen dolemite and also avenging disco godfather two other fine works of the blaxploitation canon from our friend rudy ray moore but this film the human tornado aka dolemite 2 will always hold a special place in my heart for sheer goofiness lack of skill in film production and absolute enthusiasm frankly a little too much the human tornado cannot be topped br br the opening scene sets the tone our old pal dolemite is shacking up with a white woman when some racist local cops raid the house for no good reason and wouldn't you know it the woman in bed with ol' dole is none other than the sheriff's wife her cry when she sees him he made me do it dolemite's cry are you for real subtlety was never his strong point br br highlights the cameo by a very young ernie hudson of ghostbusters fame the continuity errors characters looking one way in one shot and another in the next dolemite's suit changing colors in every single shot of his nightclub act and queen bee's demonic eyes in her first scene br br but the real joy here is rudy ray moore himself did the man really think he looked cool in this movie i certainly don't know why but you have to admire the sheer enthusiasm he has whether it be jumping totally naked off a cliff or barking orders to his gang in rhyme e g quick into the cave i have a plan to let that mother dig his own grave the man commits totally certainly he goes overboard nevermore so than any time he's doing kung fu the climactic battle is filmed at high speed but occassionaly slows down to let rudy pose and grits his teeth i'm not sure if they wanted it too look like they sped up the film as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe he was that fast in any event the matrix it is not br br human tornado much like the original dolemite is an incompetent film of enormous proportions but at least it's fun and certainly you have to give credit to these people for the effort just not that much enjoy with my hearty recommendations
<START> just as tom berenger put you into the soul of sgt barnes he has done it again with thomas beckett if i thought his world was folding in on him in the first scenes it was nothing compared to how much more i felt during the last scenes great movie even for a girl
