<START> i despise horror movies that is no secret no plot bad acting and gallons of blood are staples of these mistakes of cinema and this movie is no exception i cannot believe some cable stations actually run this garbage this particular garbage was released straight to video as i recall as mentioning any other movie would be a great insult to that other movie i say this all of the phantasm movies all of the jason movies freddy movies chucky movies and most of the michael myers movies can be summed up in one word terrible br br rating phantasm iii 0 5 10
<START> well was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns this film sure was better than that bore oh god i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance i for one don't consider her to be either ugly or untalented i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor i was rolling over this one well written and even better played out this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman's best
<START> steven spielberg produced wrote came up with ideas for and even directed episodes of amazing stories so naturally this would have to be the greatest anthology ever right unfortunately wrong some episodes are just fantastic but all too often it was a mixed bag in fact that might have been it's downfall is it was way too mixed some episodes were light comedies some were dramas some were horror and one was even animated which made this a similar but not as good 80s version of the twilight zone which also was around br br normally i'd like having a mixture of stories in an anthology show but they just didn't fully work here some of the more fantastical dramatic episodes felt like they would be better being shown late on night on the lifetime network like the episode ghost train which was directed by spielberg himself in that episode it gave the message of hope and gave us a fantasy story but overall it was just a build up to the ending which didn't blow me away anyways the horror episodes tended to work better than the drama but there were far more dramatic ones and they grow tiring to watch acting wise this anthology got some big stars similar to the original twilight zone kevin costner kiefer sutherland milton berle dom deluise harvey keitel beau bridges charlie sheen forrest whitaker tim robbins john lithgow rhea perlman danny devito patrick swayze christopher lloyd june lockhart kathy baker weird al yankovich and many other well knowns have been in episodes of the show it's fun to see well known actors in almost every episode of the series great directors have also had part in episodes including spielberg himself clint eastwood burt reynolds bob clark joe dante mick garris paul bartel joe dante robert zemeckis danny devito and even martin scorsese i'd actually recommend this more to fans of the directors and or the 80s than anyone else br br amazing stories was sometimes amazing usually good occasionally mediocre and every once in a while a real stinker came out but this show has nostalgic value to me and it's sort of fun to sit on boring afternoons and watch some episodes john williams' theme music for the show is sure to be caught in anyone's head who watches this too br br my rating good show 30 mins per episode tvpg
<START> i was drawn to this movie the moment i saw a preview of it on oscar night when i read about kay pollak i was hooked we americans are suckers for a comeback kid br br i understand this movie was a huge draw in sweden as a very provincial american i can only speculate on the reason perhaps it is because of the provocative joke that the lena character makes at the beginning of the movie and other social comment but perhaps it is because of the central message which i believe has the same appeal everywhere in affluent societies br br the message of this movie for me is the same as the movie titanic life is short people and as far as anyone really knows it's all we've got it can be taken away at any time so isn't it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls separating us from other people because we're so afraid of being hurt tearing down the walls is painful but feeling alive lies on the other side of those wretched walls feeling alive is worth taking the risk give and you will receive so start living now br br many people are criticizing this movie for it's lack of characterization and other flaws i say you are all pseudo sophisticated get a grip folks it's a parable a fable for we affluent westerners who are materially rich but whose souls are in abject poverty br br so join a choir or a band or help build housing or distribute food for those less fortunate than you spread some joy and make the world a better place as long as you get out and commune with your fellow man writing a check is not enough we are a social species by the way even the humblest of your fellow human beings can affect you in ways you never thought possible br br rugged individualism has its place but it is over rated
<START> sometimes a premise starts out good but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention deficit disorder it devolves into an incongruous mess and for three well respected actors who have made better work before and after this is a mortal shame br br so let's see premise a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop interesting to say the least make the encroaching cop a little disturbing why not it was well done in the hand who rocks the cradle and single white female and it's a proved ticket to a successful thriller br br now herein lies the dilemma create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous or throw any semblance to reality amp up the shock factor and make this cop so extreme an ultra bad variation of every other super villain that's hit cinemas since the silent age br br the producers and directors chose the latter thus is the resulting film badly made with actors trying their darnedest to make heads or tails in roles that they've essayed before and nothing much amounting to even less
<START> what can i say ms erika eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever and like a italian american fan number one of female beauty i can't forget this movie br br you know i really don't remember a lot about the plot or the situations or the other actors i only can remember about drop dead gorgeous erika and that in this film she looks better than ever i really don't care if it was a bad movie or a good movie i only care the nice moments i had been a teenager in brooklyn just contemplating erika's beauty br br well just to conclude if you are an erika eleniak's beauty fan like me definitely this film is for you
<START> so altogether i found this documentary to be strange and really pointless i know it got awards and things but i personally did not enjoy it too much there was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs some of the people in are rather different which isn't a bad thing it just didn't leave a good impression on me i was thoroughly bored by this movie no offense to my creative writing teacher the circus theme throughout the whole movie was kinda cool but i didn't get it and robotics and lion taming is definitely not my thing the green animals thing was neat i really liked the garden lots of colorful flowers but how did these four jobs connect it just didn't make much sense to me why someone would make a movie about that but if you are into stuff like this you might enjoy it who am i to stand in your way i am just forewarning you about possible suffering
<START> jess is 18 very smart and wants nothing more than to play football when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again as they would never approve of her chasing her dream they want her to settle down with a nice indian boy and learn how to cook br br bend it like beckham is a very funny feel good movie that doesn't need to be deep and complex it's just fine as it is the cast are all very good and they play their roles very well the story is simple and predictable but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny br br a great family movie 8 10
<START> sur mes lÃ¨vres or read my lips is fine little thriller that also examines the lives of 'outsiders' people who live in the periphery of our vision who struggle with the need to 'fit in' director jacques audiard with and co writer tonino benacquista have created a tense tight completely entertaining little thriller that makes some significant statements about out of the norm individuals and their plights br br carla emmanuelle devos is a plain jane mostly deaf thirty something unnoticed secretary for a company whose life is one of social and sexual isolation and whose view of the future is rather bleak enter paul vincent cassel a recent released ex con parolee who responds to an ad to be carla's assistant there is a mutual physical repulsion at first meeting carla had hoped for a well groomed genteel man who might fulfill her fantasies and paul is a coarse unkempt sleazy guy who is not impressed with being a clerk their concepts change rather quickly when paul salvages carla's job by filling her request to steal a letter that would cost her her job and paul discovers carla's lip reading ability which he sees as a way to spy on the criminals from his past who threaten his life for money owed so this odd couple of a team join forces and together enter a dangerous suspense filled ploy to gain paul's safety and freedom the relationship is full of twists and edge of the seat suspense with each of these unlikely characters fulfilling roles in their lives that fill the chinks in their walls of isolation in surprising ways br br devos and cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong once again alexandre desplat has produced a musical score that enhances the tension and cinematographer mathieu vadepied finds all the right lighting and angles to suggest the worlds of isolation of the characters as well as the hitchcockian sense of suspense director audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story he shows us the difference between 'hearing' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments this is a fine film that remains in the ranks of the best of the french film noir genre recommended grady harp
<START> i found the memorable quotes searching for video clips they forgot one of my favorites br br old person 1 you know i remember the first time they played that thing br br old person 2 you remember pterodactyls br br old person 1 and i can remember you fell for that hook line and sinker br br old person 2 oh i did not br br old lady you did so you put a big bucket on your head and took off with them army boys to fight martians br br old person 2 ain't you dead yet
<START> i remember i loved this movie when it came out i was 12 years old had a commodore 64 and loved to play rambo on it i was therefore really thrilled when i got to buy this movie really cheap i put it in my vcr and started up man this movie is really bad sylvester stallone says like 3 words in the entire movie except for that awful sentimental speech at the end and has the same expression on his face all the way and that stupid love thing in the middle it's just so amazingly predictable i just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else
<START> title zombie 3 1988 br br directors mostly lucio fulci but also claudio fragasso and bruno mattei br br cast ottaviano dellacqua massimo vani beatrice ring deran serafin br br review br br to review this flick and get some good background of it i gotta start by the beginning and the beginning of this is really george romeros dawn of the dead when dawn came out in 79 lucio fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it zombie 2 that film is the one we know as plain ole zombie you know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark ok so after that flick named zombie 2 in italy came out and made a huge chunk of cash the italians decided heck lets make some more zombie flicks these things are raking in the dough so zombie 3 was born confused yet the story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we've seen in a lot of american zombie flicks that we have seen before this one the best comparison that comes to mind is return of the living dead lets see there's the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies canister gets released into the general population and shebang we get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh a bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel they gotta fight the zombies to survive br br there was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie first and foremost lucio fulci the beloved godfather of gore from italy was sick so he couldn't really finish this film the way that he wanted to the film was then handed down to two lesser directors bruno mattei hell of the living dead and claudio fragasso zombie 4 they did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good you see fulci himself didn't really have his heart and soul on this flick he was disenchanted with it he gave the flick over to the producers and basically said do whatever the hell you want with it and god love them they did br br and that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great fulci credited as its director the main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore there's no substance to it whatsoever after the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies now in some cases this can prove to be fun if 1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and 2 there's a lot of gore and guts involved br br here we get neither well there's some inspired moments in there like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people that was cool there's also a scene involving a flying zombie head wich by the way defies all logic and explanation and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs but aside from that the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass br br endless upon endless scenes that don't do jack to move the already non existent plot along that was my main gripe with this flick the sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non existent i hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished i like my b movies but this one just really went even below that its closer to a z level flick if you ask me br br the zombie make up pure crap the zombies are all asian actors the movie was filmed in the philippines so you get a bunch of asian looking zombies but thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway its the look of the zombies that really sucks they all died with the same clothes on for some reason and what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up more like smudges on their faces one or two zombies had slightly more complex make up but it still wasn't good enough to impress its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces so not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap these are supposed to be dead folks anyhows for those expecting the usual coolness in a fulci flick don't come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else's flick and those two involved mattei and fragasso didn't really put there heart and souls into it in fact when you see the extras on the dvd you will see that when fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick he doesn't even take it to seriously you can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they just had a job to do and they did it and that my friends is the last nail on this flick there's no love and no heart put into making this film therefore you get a half assed crappy zombie flick br br only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made everybody else don't even bother rating 1 out of 5
<START> what starts out as an interesting story quickly disintegrates into nothing don't bother watching to the end hoping for an explanation of what is stalking the visitors there is no ending no explanation no resolution zip this could have been a good movie it they had purchased an entire script
<START> set in providence rhode island feeding the masses tries to be a satiric look at the role of the media in government at best it could be applied to how the us try to control media during the iraq war but it ends up feeling hollow there's never any really tension in the story and the acting never very good worst the direction of the movie is atrocious focus more on odd camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond isn't this an odd way to hold the camera special effects are pretty bad at one point video of an explosion is green screened over the city and it's laughable at best br br the film does have a couple bright spots namely the advertisements for post zombie services including a reclamation service and a party bus but it's far too little to make the film worthwhile br br for a better zombie film try hide and creep it has the same weak production value but there's much more wit humor and talent behind it
<START> i will stat of with the plot alice having survived the previous instalment of the nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again this time the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of alice's unborn child his intention is to be born again into the real world the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son this movie did start of really well as we see alice dreaming of being amanda kruger who get stuck in room and get raped by 100 manics then she being rushed to hospital but then she not longer the pregnant lady but then she amanda giving birth to freddy again br br alice and dan are the only two people to return from the 4th movie and then have gotten some new friends its' no long before freddy start to kill again i did like the first dead it okay not as good as the other deaths or dreams br br freddy himself didn't seem to be scary in this movie at all the nightmare were just boring really they were not scary or creepy at all br br acting in movies was okay for a 5th movie in the series but overall i think this movie was really dull still not worst movie of the series freddy dead is the worst br br 4 10
<START> the only time i have seen this movie was when i was 10 years old i have remembered it all of these years as i couldn't sleep for a week or more after seeing it it just absolutely rattled me i was on vacation with my aunts in ft worth texas and i will never forget it now 48 years later my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult it has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but i always remembered that barbara stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it i very much enjoyed it but it gave me quite a scare jaqui
<START> a number of posters have commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion this is always a problem with long complex dramas crime is essentially banal so the pay off is always anti climactic whilst detailed exposition detracts from the human drama the writer has used a number of clever devices to try and get round this but has not been entirely successful answers to precisely what happened and why may have been supplied but if so they are well buried the viewer inevitably feels a little cheated br br but in a sense this is unimportant the drama was never about the crime or even the investigation it was about the impact of events on the lives of those involved the family the investigators the witnesses the press and as such it was gripping the writing was a significant cut above the run of the mill for prime time drama and the performances uniformly good in an ensemble piece it is invidious to focus on individuals but penelope wilton deserves special mention for an extraordinary tour de force as the mother wife daughter and janet mcteer was in cracking form as a hard bitten old cop br br one of the most interesting aspects of the drama is the handling of race as the elephant in the room that no one is prepared to mention subtle powerful stuff
<START> this movie is just plain bad weak story weak directing and below average acting the thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising constantly for a well known internet provider it is obvious some scenes are written to do just that advertising this movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for this br br do not watch this it not worth your time
<START> this tv film tells the story of extrovert frannie suddenly returning to silk hope to visit friends and family but unaware of her mother's death her sister runs the family home but is intending to sell it and move away with her new husband frannie strongly objects to the idea and vows to keep the family heirloom as it were by getting a job and maintaining responsibility br br in comes handsome ruben and the two soon fall in love as you do and it's from this point that i sort of lost interest br br there is more to farrah fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks she can portray a character extremely convincingly when she puts her mind to it and it is certainly proved here as well as some of her previous efforts like extremities and small sacrificies a great performance from the legendary charlie's angel br br silk hope is the type of film that never shies away from its cheap and cheerful tv image and you know there was a limit to the budget but it's not the worst film ever made the positive aspects are there you just have to find them
<START> i remember that show i still remember that kick ass fun song america's funniest people frankly it should've been titled american's lame or unfunny or downright disgusting people dave couldn't save this show and neither could bob saget or the replacement hosts for afv that came later the jackalope segments were hilarious and yes dave could make some good voice overs that were better than bob's but this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos people submitted also it developed as somewhat of a variety show with lame guest stars including the olson twins plus afv was in it's prime before they started picking the drooling ugly as sin babies as the winner did i mentioned the videos were disgusting and lame but still the theme song rocks
