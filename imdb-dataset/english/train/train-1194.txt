<START> this is a good movie although people unfamiliar with the modesty blaise comics and books may find it a little slow and lacking in action for the modesty fan the movie will be very enjoyable particularly because it is very faithful in its presentation of the modesty blaise history peter o'donnell is listed in the credits as creative consultant and the film makers must have actually paid attention to him as the plot follows quite closely the details that have been presented in the comic books over the years although the events have been recast to modern days the only thing that the true fan may find disappointing is that there is no willie garvin in the story this lack of willie is again just being faithful to the modesty blaise chronology since the movie takes place in the very early days of modesty's career alexandra staden makes a very believable young modesty who actually looks a lot like modesty is supposed to look a welcome change from the travesty of the monica vitti portrayal of modesty
<START> i must say this movie has given me a dual personality i've been told again and again to shut up and start speaking like a normal person but it's very hard no not the wang did you find that disgusting and disrespectful well get in the mood for a lot more this movie is just filthy it's not a film to show your grand parents but you should show it to a teenager or some immature guy at your workplace anyway back to the voice mannerisms fortunately this site has some ladies man did anyone at the studio notice that there's supposed to be a apostrophe between the e and s so you can always have a fine little something to say to your boss or the cops i have a sheet in my wallet
<START> at first i had the reaction a lot of people left with after seeing this that shots of fat people sunbathing etc were cheap shots in a way ok so he's doing diane arbus meets whatever but it wasn't long before i realized that this wasn't being done in a dehumanizing way as the images unfold i felt that the problem was entirely the audience's we are conditioned by hollywood and also movies from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly something that ought not to be shown if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal however the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks very eloquent storytelling incredible performances and to think the scene was improvised that blonde guy is a genius actor finally i want to contradict those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an a ok character that breaks that mold so don't oversimplify the film by overlooking him yes his dog gets killed this ain't a rosy picture of the world but it's not completely hopeless anyway i felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all i wouldn't say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest but i say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it

<START> as i watch this film it is interesting to see how much it marginalizes black men the film spends its time showing how powerless the most visible black man in it is save for an heroic moment for much of the film the other black men and dark skinned black women in the film are way in the background barely visible br br vanessa williams' character was strong and sympathetic the viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her there are also some fairly visible and three dimensional support characters who are light skinned and some white characters of some warmth and dignity but 99 of the black males in this film are nothing but invisible men voiceless shadows in the background of no consequence such a horrible flaw but anything but unusual in the mainstream media
<START> this movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel the sets costumes and the color are just so vivid it is just like stepping into a comic book this is the movie i think of when the mob is mentioned the suits the hats and the attitudes br br hoffman gives comic relief as mumbles and you can't help but feel sorry for madonna as she tries and fails to win tracy over this movie contains all the classic mob clichÃ©s burying people in concrete blowing up peoples cars tieing up the good guy and attempting to blow up his girlfriends house br br this movie is a classic in ever sense of the word even camera angels cry out comic book its so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic should be made into a movie after seeing such mistakes as spawn and the hulk br br you have to see this movie
<START> they probably should have called this movie the map because the majority of the whole stupid film is revolved around a map of a cemetery not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there are the only thing they show more than the map itself is the little beads of sweat that is constantly building up on the forehead of our main character this of course was the film makers way of showing us how incredibly tense things are getting up on the immortal hills cemetery come on now couldn't they have shown us just one of the death scenes we hear a whole lot about how everyone who is listed on the map is dropping like flies but we don't get to see anything some how i bury the living manged to keep my attention so i was fairly generous with the rating i gave it but i will not recommend this movie to anyone unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat i recommend renting a better i movie such as i spit on your grave or i drink your blood
<START> moe and larry are newly henpecked husbands having married shemp's demanding sisters at his music studio shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself br br husbands beware is a remake of 1947's brideless groom widely considered by many to be one of the best stooge films with shemp the remake contains most of the footage from that film the new scenes shot may 17 1955 include the storyline of moe and larry marrying shemp's sisters along with their cooking of a turkey laced with turpentine a few new scenes are tacked onto the end of the film as well a double for dee green was used if you blink you will miss the double's appearance br br husbands beware would have made for a good film with just the plot line of marrying the sisters budget considerations coupled with fewer bookings for two reel comedies influenced the decision to use older footage br br although completely new films were still being made by the stooges most of their releases by 1955 56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in husbands beware while one of these hybrids is watchable and entertaining we get to see most of brideless groom again and the new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer through the film this film is one of the last stooge comedies to feature new footage of shemp and it was released six weeks after his death br br 7 out of 10
<START> this is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre action comedy conceptwise it resembles rush hour but completely lacks the action the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie let it be known that i enjoy jay leno as a stand up and as a talk show host but he just cannot act he is awful when he tries to act tough he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one liners which by the way aren't very funny and seeing him run even back then is not a pleasant sight in addition i have a feeling that pat morita at least by today's standards doesn't give a very politically correct impression of the japanese don't even get me started about the story i give it a 2 out of 10
<START> this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time all of you who regard this movie as absolute sh t obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer it shows us that real life and ficticious action can produce a winning combination also as a romantic comedy it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as donald sutherland singing a song like they're going to find your anus on a mountain on mars
<START> gene kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with mgm here he's at the top of his creative powers working with the arthur freed musical unit hard to believe when you watch an american in paris that the players never left the back lot at mgm br br the magic of an american in paris is due to the creative editing under the direction of vincent minnelli and the sets that mgm designed blended with some background establishing shots the idea of the film originated with kelly who wanted simply to do a film with a lengthy ballet sequence involving george gershwin's tone poem an american in paris it sounded good to arthur freed who approached ira gershwin who said fine with him as long as they used other gershwin material br br gershwin got the kind of deal for gershwin music that irving berlin normally got not one note of non gershwin music is heard in an american in paris listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like embraceable you and but not for me which are not real musical numbers br br another guy who was a fair hand at writing lyrics alan jay lerner wrote the story which admittedly is a thin one all about an ex gi played by gene kelly who after world war ii never left france just settled into an apartment on the left bank and proceeded to become a starving artist he lives with eccentric composer oscar levant and does that ever sound like a redundancy br br two women are interested in him another expatriate american played by nina foch who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he'll reciprocate in other matters but kelly falls for a shop girl played by leslie caron in her film debut caron also has musical comedy star georges guetary interested in here br br of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of george gershwin an american in paris happens to be the first film i ever saw as an in flight movie on the first airplane trip i ever took i still remember flying back from phoenix arizona to kennedy airport seeing gene kelly doing i've got rhythm my favorite number in the film however is tra la la which kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with oscar levant playing the piano at one point kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano br br in a book about arthur freed i read a quote where he said in the american in paris ballet sequence was to be done with the background of the french impressionists which he felt the public would take to rather than a realistic setting on the streets or back lot so it happened that way kelly had done lengthy ballet sequences in words and music the pirate and on the town but this one topped them all still does in my opinion and that includes some of gene kelly's later films br br in a surprise upset at the oscars an american in paris was chosen best picture for 1951 beating out the heavily favored a streetcar named desire i guess fantasy trumped realism that year big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well br br still an american in paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof something less likely to be repeated
<START> i've read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life eg what it takes to get into music school britney bashing etc etc so let's focus on the movie and the message br br i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years and for a family movie for the average adult male 2 out of 10 br br i like pop rock music i'm 45 i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews i didn't recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any 'self promotion' br br i watch movies to be entertained i don't care about casting lighting producers directors etc what is the movie and does it entertain me br br i watched this movie for the message the world's greatest epidemic is low self esteem which is a whole other story so watched with the message in mind as that is an area of interest the movie is light bright and breezy great for kids i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up don't give up message so yeh it was a bit predictable great message though should be more of them br br this movie is a great family movie but for a bloke watching by himself get hannibal
<START> i saw the 7 5 imdb rating on this movie and on the basis of that decided to watch this movie which my roommate had rented she said she had seen it before it's funny and sad i cried the first time i saw it she gushed maybe compared to other bollywood movies this deserves a 7 5 out of 10 but in comparison to all the other movies i have seen in my lifetime this deserves no more than a 3 any movie where i can perpetually guess what is going to happen next is no good for me the characters are unbelievable how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are contrived it is over dramatic and the songs aren't all that great my biggest problem with bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety all the emotions are way too overdone and thus not at all realistic any emotion or bond between characters that is the least bit subtle must be magnified with an unnecessary song i think i understood that the relationship between the father and son was more like one between friends than one between a parent and child without having to have it conveyed via a five minute long song the stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary we get it laxman isn't the sharpest tool in the shed if a movie tries to elicit tears through the most hackneyed means possible it just isn't meaningful just a bit embarrassing br br spoiler br br generally if someone has terminal stage lung cancer their son who lives with them would know something was wrong without having to be told too many plot holes to count at first the movie was amusing and cute in the way bollywood movies are to people who don't watch them that avidly but it just got tedious it takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is amusing and heartwrenching and the best way to do it is usually not having all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartwrenching parts at the end br br spoiler over perhaps it had a very little more depth than other bollywood movies that i have seen but not much at all i spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny i didn't shed a single tear nor did i feel like it rather i was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust at the attempt at a dramatic ending i don't recommend this movie if you want to watch something good i recommend it if you want to watch a bollywood movie that is kind of sad
<START> i do not watch much television and came across this show reality show i sure hope this is not for real if i was a man and had such a nag and was married to someone so snotty it would be grounds for divorce i think she sets a bad example of how a person should treat a person they love that is one thing that is wrong with our world now so many people in bad relationships selfish and do not know the meaning of what it is to truly love another it is self sacrificing and not something that should be on merritt that does not give one a very good feeling to watch what should be in private counseling if his personality on the show is for real then he deserves someone much better that would show real true love and care for him and appreciate him for who he is is this show a reality or made up for ratings i really would like to know sincerely gb
<START> i'm not going to criticize the movie there isn't that much to talk about it has good animal actions scenes which were probably pretty astonishing at the time clyde beatty isn't exactly a matinÃ©e idol he's a little slight and not particularly good looking but that's ok he's the man in that lion cage we know that when he can't take the time away from his lions to tend to his girlfriend he will end up on an island with her and have to save the day someone said earlier that it is a history lesson the scenes at the circus are of another day especially the kids who hang around i didn't realize that even back in the thirties they sailed on three masted schooners it looked like something out of 1860 i guess that's the stock footage they had no wonder the thing got wrecked they're always talking about fixing her up there's even a dirigible it tells us a little about male female relationships at the time a kind of giggly silliness but if you don't take it too seriously you can have fun watching it
<START> i've tried to watch this so called comedy but it's very hard to bear this is a bad narrow minded clichÃ© ridden movie definitively not funny but very much boring and annoying indeed bad script bad acting it's a complete waste of time and there remains nothing more to say i'm afraid br br 1 out of 10 points
<START> born again is a okay episode of season 1 the reincarnation bit in my opinion is cool the more i watch it the more i like it yet it will never rise above 'very good' for me even though it is not very memorable i'll always remember it as the reincarnation episode anyway now i will say what is good and bad about this episode br br the good oragami oh yeah br br that fish tank was nice br br thrown out of a window very classy x br br the bad marry your best friend's wife o o br br what a random pick to reincarnate br br why didn't the guy who died by having his scarf tangled up try to take his scarf off instead br br conclusion okay episode not very memorable 7 10
<START> one of the most interesting movies to be classified as blaxploitation bakshi's coonskin is a rich text full of wonderful insight he wrote it in collaboration with scat man crothers and barry white who appear in the film as well the racist imagery can often be disturbing but the message of the movie was so powerful that the naacp gave it an endorsement but only grudgingly br br i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in an examination of the pervading atmosphere of racism that bakshi attempts to deconstruct wonderful stuff
<START> this movie was pretty absurd there was a few funny parts its goes right in to the bin of movies in my memory where i think hmm that movie had a few funny parts but overall pretty ridiculous plot or lack of br br i thought it seemed like ben was trying a little too hard to be a cooky funny guy and i didn't understand how he was a self made multi millionaire and still such an idiot anyways i like ben affleck he makes some crap but hey i can forgive him i mean i liked jersey girl i didn't think gigli was all his fault i like him overall i guess he's kinda like the kid you feel sorry for cuz he just can't seem to get it right br br my advice would be to avoid this flick it didn't really develop in to a workable plot and catherine o'hara and jimmy g weren't used as well as they could have been they deserved better overall this movie is not home alone it's not a christmas story its not christmas vacation or any of the other classics forever forgettable
