<START> the 700 club gives a great perspective on world events some have described it as disingenuous or cheesy i find the program to be informative and inspirational it is only natural for many to throw mud on a program that has proved to be so successful there are very few shows that can point to a 40 year track record of success in the world of television media and the 700 club is one of them while mr robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be assassinated i find it curious that so many people will literally trip over themselves to hop on the bandwagon of criticism i have certainly said some foolish things in my life i would certainly be willing to forgive mr robertson since he puts out a great show
<START> with harry callahan getting up in years the inevitable old man with a chip on his shoulder' story had to come into play eventually callahan looking fragile sometimes and out of place his demeanor still was unwavering thankfully this film took some time off to develop a different type of story one that might reinvent the dirty harry and the whole genre while the film fell short in doing so it was still an excellent addition to the series even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and new wave music
<START> what kind of sh t is this power rangers vs freddy it was watchable and as good as the first film in the beginning but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in theirs dreams it started to become childish this sh t should have been rated pg or pg 13 rather than r i expected to see some very mature stuff but it was only for the 1 3 of the film the rest are for little kids plus it's focused too much on christianity i know freddy's a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons why does it always have to be christianity this is total orientalism and filled with white men westerner's superiority don't' watch this show it to little kids who loves power rangers
<START> having worked in downtown manhattan and often ate my lunch during the summer days in the park near city hall i would see the mayor come and go it was great being able to go beyond the doors of city hall and see what it looked like in the lobby and through out the entire building al pacino mayor john pappas gigli '03 gave an outstanding performance through out the entire picture and especially when he gave a speech at an african american church for a little boy who was slain john cusack deputy mayor kevin calhoun runaway jury '03 was a devoted servant to the mayor and worshiped him in everything he attempted to accomplish bridget fonda marybeth cogan starts to fall in love with kevin calhoun and gives a great supporting role last but not least danny aiello frank anselmo off key '01 played a mob boss who had some very difficult choices to make towards the end of the picture great film with great acting and fantastic photography in nyc
<START> the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self desctruction the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at sympathize with which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked best br br simon geist is a man in his late 30s early 40s who creates a pop culture driven editorial magazine called the next big thing thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitch slap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture his live in female friend darla is also writing a magazine which is real which mainly has to do with her and simon as well as her and her father darla is a genuinely loveable or loathable character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much to him as is tedra the music video queen for a bunch of b rated rock bands still these characters weave a very interesting web together and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if you're in the indie art house crowd mark my words br br
<START> the only redeeming part of this movie was the price i paid at least all i lost was 3 00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb the crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat when the female lead and the fbi guy went to the alleged killers location mr fbi handed the female a revolver when the alleged killer came out the door the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic one is left to ponder would an fbp agent hand a weapon to a civilian i think not ms xavier appears to be a very attractive female it is too bad the r rating did not allow much of her to be seen it would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out
<START> don't be deceived as i was by the 'glowing' reviews quoted on the dvd box wildly entertaining a seriously scary freakout and the worst of all on par with jaws this movie is none of the above br br normally i don't bother with writing bad reviews for films but i can't believe this one is resting at a comfortable 7 on imdb it doesn't deserve it br br after a so so opening daylight attack by a monster created by what else chemicals dumped by lazy scientists this movie goes absolutely nowhere and it goes there sloooowly basically and improbably a girl is snagged by the monster i'll give them points for a good creature design but this ain't no weta creation and her semi comical family spend an hour and a half tracking her down in the sewers surrounding the han river their search lacks any suspense again someone called this on par with jaws and by the time they find her you realize it was all pretty much pointless other than that a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one funny scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop br br blech this was bad i'm not kidding you want to see a rotten monster movie rent deep rising at least you'll save 30 minutes of your life
<START> this like murder she wrote is one of those shows that after a stressful day at school i sit down in front of the tv and watch why because i genuinely enjoy it and it's a shame it's not on the air anymore dick van dyke is amazing as dr mark sloan a doctor turned detective who with his son solves murders he is joined by a largely unknown but very competent supporting cast namely his real life son barry van dyke victoria rowell is also good but i noticed that every series her hairstyle changes i also liked scott baio and charlie schlatter but i particularly loved michael tucci as norman and was puzzled how he suddenly disappeared this show is so entertaining with great guest stars it's a bit obvious at times like colombo but in every episode there is always something to chuckle about in conclusion a great series with two thumbs up and a 10 10 bethany cox
<START> the ogre is a film made for tv in italy and wasn't intended to be a sequel to demons as lamberto bava even mentions it on the interview on the sheirk show dvd but it was called demons iii to be part of the demons series the music in demons and demons 2 was 80's rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two was gory horror demons iii the ogre is a architectural horror so that's how demons iii isn't a proper sequel to demons but i still like this film br br the music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle that the film is set in the ogre is another thing why i like the film there are two other films that are classed as demons iii and that is black demons demoni 3 and the church demons 3 demons iii the ogre is a good film as long as you don't compare it with demons and demons 2
<START> i gotta be straight up i haven't seen a film as solid as dog bite dog in quite a while i'm a big fan of the old school late 80s to mid 90s era catiii films and i had been hearing that that style of films is making a bit of a come back with films such as this and herman yau's gong tau which as of this writing i have not yet seen so i was very interested to give some of these newer wave catiii films a shot did this film live up to my expectations absolutely but not quite in the fashion that i imagined br br the story follows a young animalistic resourceful and virtually unstoppable thai hit man with a somewhat vague history who comes to hong kong to complete a mission due to some bad luck he is quickly identified by a roguish copy who exudes many of the same qualities as our hit man and is quickly apprehended and captured this state of affairs doesn't last long though as the un named assassin escapes from his captors and quickly shows the local police that he is not to be taken lightly the hunt is on and a cat and mouse game between the police and the mad dog as the police refer to him ensues along the way mad dog is inadvertently befriended by a slow witted young woman and a bond forms between the two when she helps him out of a sticky situation the ante keeps getting upped as mad dog's only objective is to get out of hong kong and back to thailand by any means necessary and the cops keep trying to reel him in alive br br i could probably write ten paragraphs about this complex and thoroughly layered film but i don't want to give too much away i watched dog bite dog knowing nothing about the premise and i think it's the type of film that is definitely better appreciated that way as to comparisons to the older style catiii films there are some similarities dog bite dog has some hyper violent moments reminiscent of the good ol' days but is never quite as sleazy or grimy as old school classicks like the untold story or red to kill where many of the older catiii films' main intention was to shock dog bite dog is a far more thought out and well rounded production though that's not to take anything away from those catiii films that i hold so dear this film is far more emotional than it is exploitative and as we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds the audience begins to bond and identify with both sides there really are no clear cut good and bad guys as mad dog shows moments of extreme compassion and the cops stoop to extremely unorthodox methods to try to flesh out the killer there's also no nudity sex in this film which is a typical characteristic of the older catiii films personally i would compare dog bite dog more to park's sympathy for mr vengeance or perhaps the pang brother's bangkok dangerous as both of those films mixed extremely emotional overtones with strong and unflinching action and violence again there's pretty much nothing that i didn't like about this film the acting is dead on the cinematography is sharp and well done and the whole film skillfully blends several different elements successfully in a way that isn't seen very often is this film and others like it the rebirth of the catiii film not exactly but it is a very solid film that's absolutely worth checking out 9 10
<START> from very long we are seeing movies on gandhi and mostly the light is always on portrayal of gandhi as freedom fighter or man with principles but when i heard that a movie is being made which will highlight gandhi as father and stress on his relationship with his son it instantly hit my attention as this is one territory which is least being explored as it has his own dark side and less people shown courage to dwell into it fortunetly anil kapoor producer and feroz abbad khan director did br br the story start with gandhi working in south africa and his relationship with white people and his wife latter akshay harilal joined his father for becoming a barrister but his dream took overturn when his father gandhi pushed or motivate him to become freedom fighter it showcase that gandhi believes more on practical study rather then formal education harilal too try to walk on his father footstep but soon failed as its infatuation towards his wife children and his own dream of becoming big success altered his path and then start the repulsion between son and father he finally defeated his father in terms of pursuing his dream and to left him on his own terms he written back to india but then start his unsuccessful stories which become bigger and bigger with time i am leaving reader to see movie to catch further story br br performance first akshay he has given best performance of his tenure so far and is absolutely convincing in his portrayal as harilal gandhi the scene in which he reach the room where his wife dead body is placed is one where you can see a fine actor which is hidden developing in akshay darshan jariwala is also good as mk gandhi and able to live up such a larger then life character he performed well and with quite an ease shefali chaya now shah as kasturba is brilliant actress and already proved her metal in tv serials bhumika chawla too performed well but actress of her candidature is waste in these kinds of role other actor have also justifies their performances br br technique and make up is also good and cinematography especially that duo tone color picturisation was too good costume looks and match with context br br overall a worth seeing movie which is defiantly slow in progress and impatient people may find it boring but give you an insight of area which is not brought to silver screen till date also the way story progress and connection of scene may look worn to some people and to critics especially but for an average movie watcher like me it still enough to make me occupied on my seat till end
<START> okay so someone somewhere a few years ago thought it would be a good idea to make a 3d imax movie about some flies stowing away aboard the apollo 11 and going to the moon so they did someone somewhere was an idiot br br i want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware as far as i can tell the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on the graphics in general were pretty good the rocket launch gave me chills like a good rocket launch always does my popular mechanics flying car gearhead blood still runs strong and the 3d was pretty effective the cg wasn't pixar quality but it was generally good the flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics with some half assed late 60s characters thrown in for colour hippie flies african american flies with giant afros and black shades etc and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads although they made suitably gross squelching noises br br the scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework relying on offensive and outdated clichÃ©s 60s gender politics including mostly useless female characters racial stereotypes evil russians a fat fly who only wants to eat grade two level gross out humour in a movie aimed for imax they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel they didn't get their physics right zero g in the lunar module during landing burn please they couldn't even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between houston and the astronauts all of which is in the public domain instead they wrote their own dialogue which sounds like crap br br but we liked the maggots br br so they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots uh yay 1 5 5
<START> the third installment of the carnosaur trilogy features a bunch of keystone kops quality military commandos trying to kill two velociraptors and a t rex i give it a 4 out of sheer sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs the movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy it really can't be taken seriously more significantly however watching this movie i can't help but notice some interesting parallels between the carnosaur and xtro trilogies the first installment in both franchises is a dark disturbing film that has become a cult classic the second is an alien ripoff and the third is a tongue in cheek almost slapstick whether intentional or not movie that has you rolling on the floor laughing also like the xtro franchise all the carnosaur movies are completely unrelated to one another they they only carry the franchise name to drum up interest in the sequels i guess obviously carnosaur and xtro have two different production groups at work here but if you've seen all three movies of both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two
<START> the writer director of this film obviously doesn't know anything about film i think the dp on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun br br the story was awful the characters were very one dimensional for someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans that someone is kidding their self it was probably the writer director no poker fan in this world likes this movie even your money man hates this project to go into a casino and play a few hands doesn't give you the experience to write about poker keep your day job and if it's playing poker then you must be hurt'n
<START> i recently watched caprica again and thought i might as well come and write up a review i first saw this right after i saw the series finale of battlestar galactica being a big drooling fan boy of the show left me clinging onto anything i could of the shows universe so i didn't know what to expect but i did come out with a smile though i must admit br br the story starts off dramatically on planet of caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting characters i won't give too much away but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of the story but i suggest you watch this br br must say esai morales is one hell of an actor he pulled off a young joseph adama father of the admiral in battlestar galactica i found his acting spot on and i could believe that he is the father of william adama from bsg br br also eric stoltz fits his role precisely special note it was good to see polly walker outside of rome don't sit down and watch caprica with the expectation of it being like battlestar galactica because the story line is pretty straight forward and anyone can watch it without having to have see bsg br br this show is a well written drama for those who like there drama with a bit of a sci fi kick
<START> another pokemon movie has hit the theaters and again i'm hearing the same old pokemon is dead blah blah blah the franchise's detractors couldn't be more wrong kids are still playing the trading card game they're still watching the tv series they're waiting for the game boy advance games and they want to see pokemon the 4th movie br br that said pokemon the 4th movie introduces us to two more legendary pokemon suicune the north wind of lore and celebi guardian of the forest and star of the show celebi transports itself and a boy named sam 40 years into the future to the present day where pokemon trainer ash his faithful pikachu and his friends brock and misty are traveling through johto sam and ash become fast friends once they discover the other's mutual love for pokemon sam's vintage pokeball with screw on top is a great moment together they decide to protect celebi from the villain of the story the team rocket agent aptly named vicious who is hell bent on capturing celebi for his own ends will ash and sam be able to protect celebi from vicious' dark balls where does suicune fit into the picture will jessie james and meowth have bigger parts in this movie than before and just who is sam really br br like with the first 3 movies if you go into the movie deciding that you're automatically going to hate it no matter what simply because it's pokemon or just because your child niece nephew younger sibling et cetera dragged you into it then you're going to hate it because you've decided that you want to hate it that may be but to blindly trash pokemon the 4th movie simply because it is a pokemon movie and especially without having seen it is just plain stupid even non fans can enjoy this movie without having to know every last detail of the world of pokemon i'm not saying that you will become a pokemon fan because of this movie but you can indeed enjoy it if you'll let yourself br br unlike the first 3 pokemon movies pokemon the 4th movie is being distributed by miramax who i've heard is also working on securing the rights to the 5th pokemon movie which was released this past summer in japan miramax claims to have some boffo aggressive marketing strategy for pokemon the 4th movie but all i've seen so far is a feeble limited release which doesn't include the usual pikachu short in the beginning which i was really looking forward to this time i hope that miramax will see fit to put the pikachu short called pikachu's exciting hide and seek onto at least the dvd vhs release if not with a future wider release of pokemon the 4th movie i hope that the current release is just the tip of the iceberg for this very entertaining film
<START> this is not only one of the greatest jackie chan films but also one of the greatest kung fu movies of all time br br we've come to expect crazy stunts and fast creative action in chan's movies and this one set the benchmark for others to follow it's two hours of pure entertainment that impresses all the way through br br as well as the superb action we have a viable storyline and believable characters with chan taking what appears to be a more western approach to the writing mixing eastern resolution methods ie kicking ass br br overall it's funny serious entertaining and groundbreaking a must for any kung fu fan whilst at the same time remaining accessible to the wider reaches of the film community
<START> michelle rodriguez is a well built high school senior who discovers that she has a powerful punch and begins amateur training at a brooklyn gym santiago douglas is a a handsome young man barely older than she who also trains there they meet after class so to speak and feel attracted to each other no sex santiago has been instructed to save it for his next bout br br both are participants in a gender blind athletic program that makes no distinctions between males and females a misguided attempt to level the athletic playing field br br a conservative radio commentator recently announced and i swear i'm not making this up let's face it the president is black i'm here to make an equally perspicacious observation men and women are different now in 99 cases out of 100 this needn't make any difference in physical performance but in the top one percent trained athletes whose skills have been honed to a fine edge men generally have the advantage with their narrow hips they can run faster and they have greater muscle mass and upper torso strength these differences in body build make it possible for women to give birth and raise children and for men to catch and kill food for them this sexual bifurcation is the result of the perfectly normal process of natural selection without it there might not be any humans at all and that boys and girls is why they have men's events and women's events at the olympics i speak to you as your anthropologist that will be ten cents paypal preferred br br that's why i called this gender blind program misguided as talented a boxer as rodrigues is as she approaches the zenith of the game she will eventually lose to a male br br that's where the complication arises in this movie rodrigues is finally matched against her boy friend douglas neither wants to loose any anger on the other not to mention roundhouse rights but the pride of both is at stake and the pride is both personal and gender related douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring and rodriguez is offended by what she sees as his patronizing attitude it ends happily br br i wasn't really expecting much from the film i thought it would be a rip off of clint eastwood's million dollar baby until i discovered that this was released years earlier and i'd never heard of the director or of any of the performers that sort of obscurity generally augers ill made for television weepers and so forth br br but i was surprised at how neatly this is put together the total absence of bathos left me open mouthed so did the minimal use of boxing clichÃ©s the frayed ropes the blood the cutting of the swollen eye the battered post bout faces the fat and sweaty onlooker shouting kill him the slow motion landing of glove on nose the spray of sweat from the mauled head the heroic music signaling the long awaited apotheosis of the victor none of that here well almost none the whole plot could be considered formulaic tough kid finds outlet in the ring etc br br the feeling you're left with is that this is probably pretty much what these amateur contests are like different from those we see on tv and in ordinary movies no bells ring for instance instead a dancing and observant referee yells stop and box the contestants wear head gear the gym is populated not by a crowd of cheering spectators but only by a handful of people who have some particular interest in the goings on it's a clean movie despite the rather grim setting and the unhappy family dynamics br br michelle rodriguez can look pretty mean what with her muscular bulk and her eyes glowing under her lowered brow but once you get used to the idea that this is a girl who can beat you to a pulp anytime she wants and once you hear the feminine contours of her supersegmentals she ain't bad a scene in which she battles her father to the floor is overdoing it it was a little hard to understand douglas's restraint when rodriguez crawls all over him in bed the director karyn kusama has chosen her talent carefully br br shows what you can do with some talent imagination and a modicum of money there ought to be more films like it take one of those multi billion dollar blockbusters full of dinosaurs or space ships and spread the generosity around a little
<START> not very interesting teen whodunit saved from being a turkey from some decent performances the main cast consisting of taye diggs mia kirshner dominique swain and surprisingly meredith monroe are all good but the story is not very original
<START> what is this a low budget sex comedy anyway it describes perfectly the people in spain they could come up with a better idea i mean they do this kind of movies since the 60s and people like them this is neither a teen comedy nor a family one you can't let your 12 year old watch 2 guys in bed kissing he'll never want to go to spain this should be rated r because only people 35 seem to laugh watching s i'm truly disappointed maybe i don't like gays which is quite an important part of the movie br br foreign humor is awful in films except kusturica stick with doing dramas if you want a new comedy try talladega nights
