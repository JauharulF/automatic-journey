<START> who doesn't have unresolved issues with parents and which parents don't have unresolved issues with each other br br i know that sounds heavy but this is played for laughs in the movie making both the comedy better and the drama better i've always like paul reiser and peter falk and although i was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie i was enchanted from the very first scene br br especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person and peter falk's monologue about being a hard working sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point without that scene being acted so well the movie would have seemed far less nuanced and the character far less interesting br br nicely done paul and peter
<START> cheap and manipulative this film has no heart br br it's also got dire dialogue unconvincing characters and a preposterous or rather non existent story it just lurches from bad to worse in a cynical effort to wrench some kind of emotion from an insincere and unengaging hysterion afest br br and the hedgehog how many cheap shots can a film take the hedgehog by the way gave the most convincing and watchable performance in this ninety minute cringe athon br br if you have considered watching this film don't i'm sorry but i cannot find a single redeeming feature to this movie it scores a big fat zero with me strictly for sub dogma knicker wetters yawneroony br br still if you liked dancing in the dark br br
<START> i was lucky enough to catch this film finally on turner classic films tonight as it is one of the films that won an oscar for special effects in their yearly month of oscar winning films br br bedknobs and broomsticks is easily a sequel film for the earlier success of mary poppins that film too was a big success and an oscar winner best actress for julie andrews like mary poppins bedknobs has david tomlinson in it in a role wherein he learns about parenting it is a fine mixture of live action and animation it is set in a past period of british history if not the edwardian georgian world of 1912 london it is england's coastline during the dunkirk summer of 1940 it even has old reginald owen in it here as a general in the home guard whereas formerly he was admiral boom in mary poppins ironically it was owen's final role br br the home guard sequences not too many in the film reminds one of the british series dad's army dealing with the problems of the local home guard in the early years of the war the period is also well suggested by the appearance of the three rawlins children as war orphans from the bombings in the blitz in london and in typical disney fashion in the musical number portobello road different members of the british army including soldiers from india and the caribbean complete with metal drums yet appear with scottish and local female auxiliaries in costume br br all of which surprisingly is a plus but the biggest plus is that for angela lansbury her performance as eglantine price is finally it her sole real musical film lead in a noteworthy acting career lansbury never got the real career musical role she deserved as auntie mame in the musical mame that came out shortly after bedknobs did she had been in singing parts in gaslight with her brief up in a balloon boys and in the picture of dorian gray with little yellow bird and best of all in support and in conclusion of the harvey girls with the final reprise of on the atchison topeka and the santa fe but only here does she play the female lead so when you hear her singing with david tomlinson you may be able to understand what we lost when she did not play mame dennis burnside br br the rest of the cast is pretty good tomlinson here learning that he can rise to the occasion after a lifetime of relative failure the three children cindy o'callaghan roy snart and ian weighill actually showing more interesting sides in their characters than their edwardian predecessors in poppins weighill in particular as something of a budding opportunist thinking of blackmailing lansbury after finding out she is a witch the only surprising waste possibly due to cutting of scenes is roddy mcdowall as the local vicar who is only in two sequences of the film with his possible role as a disapproving foe of witchcraft he should have had a bigger part also of note is john ericson as the german officer who leads a raid at the conclusion of the film only to find that he is facing something more powerful than he ever imagined in the british countryside and sam jaffe as a competitor for the magic formula that lansbury and tomlinson are seeking br br as for the animation the two sequences under the sea in a lagoon and at the wildest soccer match ever drawn are well worth the view with tomlinson pulled into the latter as the referee and getting pretty badly banged up in various charges and scrimmages as i said it is a pretty fine sample of the disney studio's best work
<START> before stan laurel became the smaller half of the all time greatest comedy team he laboured under contract to broncho billy anderson in a series of cheapies many of which were parodies of major hollywood features following a dispute with anderson laurel continued the informal series of parodies at joe rock's smaller and more indigent production company br br most of laurel's parody films were only mildly funny at the time and even less funny for modern audiences who haven't seen the original movie which laurel is parodying 'west of hot dog' is a fairly generic parody of cowboy shoot 'em ups it's marginally a specific parody of 'west of the pecos' an oater released two years earlier with no major actors since 'west of the pecos' was never a huge success it's difficult to see why stan's film unit chose this particular movie as a target for their lampoonery much less why they waited so long after its release to parody it and where did they get that title 'west of hot dog' possibly it's down to the fact that 'hot dog ' was a sexual interjection favoured by american lechers in the 1920s as in the opening scene of the stage play 'machinal' br br 'west of hot dog' was produced and co directed by joe rock among his many other achievements rock introduced laurel to lois neilson and he was subsequently best man at their wedding full disclosure in the last years of his life i had the great privilege of befriending joe rock and interviewing him nearly ninety years old at the time rock's memory was impressively clear but he remembered nothing at all about 'west of hot dog' and i can't blame him this movie is eminently forgettable br br the leading lady's character is named little mustard if that's meant to be a parody of something in 'west of the pecos' i don't get it there are a couple of 'impossible' gags here including laurel's method for mounting a horse for just one moment in this movie stan laurel reminded me of the great buster keaton when he suddenly broke into a run 'west of hot dog' is vaguely similar in subject matter and tone to keaton's short comedy 'the frozen north' but keaton's version is much funnier the plot of this film somewhat anticipates a situation in keaton's feature 'our hospitality' but again suffers by comparison here two tough varmint brothers expect to inherit the last chance saloon but the previous owner has bequeathed it to weakling tenderfoot stan however the brothers will become the legal heirs if stan dies hmmm br br seriously though is such a bequest legal as soon as stan takes possession of the property surely any further questions of ownership or inheritance become his decision not the previous owner's decision i had plenty of time to consider such points of law while watching this dull comedy br br at one point a gag involves some crude animation drawn directly onto the film stock it looks cheap and isn't funny br br this 'hot dog' is no weiner and no winner it's just a whiner my rating one point out of 10 hang on stan in a few more years you'll be one half of a comedy legend
<START> yeah it is in fact it's somewhere in my top 20 all time favorite movies number 15 i think anyways i'm usually not one for plots but i think plots work better in anime and rpg video games final fantasy 7 for example and not movies but this one has it all vivid drawings of planets stars an extremely well written screenplay while this is not really for children they can still watch it it contains no graphic blood guts and silicone but i don't think they're going to understand it
<START> alright if you want to go see this movie just give me our money i'll br br kick you were it counts and you'll have the same amount of fun i'll br br even guarantee more fun this movie once again shows what happens when br br you can't get any one else to hire your family and your forced to make br br your own movies same i'm going through puberty humor jokes just br br dumber and grosser this movie is really a disgrace to movie goers they br br try to shock you into laughing because you can't believe the levels they br br have to stoop to make you laugh so my offer above stands as
<START> this is not a loose but a precise faithful remake of 1958 monicelli's classic i soliti ignoti with toto' mastroianni gassman cardinale etc and that's the reason is good it copies all the funny characters and the plot even in details like the scene where the photographer steals the camera from the local market br br i have watched the superb old version many times and i knew by heart all the gangs and the ending but i still enjoyed welcome to collinwood which has its own freshness and atmosphere it is interesting to see how the life and ways of the little thieves in 1950's italy are adapted to 2002's usa things haven't changed much 8 10
<START> in 1914 charlie chaplin began making pictures these were made for mack sennett also known as keystone studios and were literally churned out in very rapid succession the short comedies had very little structure and were completely ad libbed as a result the films though popular in their day were just awful by today's standards many of them bear a strong similarity to home movies featuring obnoxious relatives mugging for the camera many others show the characters wander in front of the camera and do pretty much nothing and regardless of the outcome keystone sent them straight to theaters my assumption is that all movies at this time must have been pretty bad as the keystone films with chaplin were very successful br br the charlie chaplin we know and love today only began to evolve later in chaplin's career with keystone by 1915 he signed a new lucrative contract with essenay studios and the films improved dramatically with chaplin as director however at times these films were still very rough and not especially memorable no chaplin as the cute little tramp was still evolving in 1916 when he switched to mutual studios his films once again improved and he became the more recognizable nice guy in many of the previous films he was just a jerk either getting drunk a lot beating up women provoking fights with innocent people etc the final evolution of his little tramp to classic status occurred in the 1920s as a result of his full length films br br it's interesting that this film is called twenty minutes of love since the film only lasts about 10 minutes oh well the plot what little there is involves the little tramp in the park a couple wants to neck but inexplicably charlie insists on practically sitting on the couple's lap and really annoying them i can't understand why and the short consists of charlie wandering about the park annoying these people and some others later in the film perhaps he was looking for a threesome i don't know but the film lacks coherence and just isn't particularly funny even when people start slapping each other and pushing each other in the lake a typical poor effort before chaplin began to give his character a plot and personality
<START> this 1939 film tried to capitalize on the much better michael curtiz's film angels with dirty faces as directed by ray enright the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in america's inner cities today br br the film is only worth seeing because of the presence of ann sheridan and ronald reagan who showed they were well paired together the dead end kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks br br in a way it's curious how arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in new york it was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created in today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality the young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals how times change
<START> it's terrific when a funny movie doesn't make smile you what a pity this film is very boring and so long it's simply painfull the story is staggering without goal and no fun br br you feel better when it's finished
<START> there was some truth to this movie i remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fisherman finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished i also recall they were charged with interfering with a corpse or some such charge i'm not sure if it was in australia the viewers outside of australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders wolf creek and this film would encourage this perception the film itself reminded me of a simple plan but as far a being one of the best australian films ever as someone claimed i can't be that generous put it this way i wouldn't bother watching it again
<START> man on fire was hot i love a classic tale of good ol' revenge and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl br br the writers did an excellent job in this movie of building the relationship between creasy denzel washington and pita dakota fanning so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive creasy had to rescue pita it was also good that creasy wasn't a choir boy type trying to rescue pita through the proper channels but instead used torture tactics and street smarts some may say torture is wrong regardless and you may be right but when you see the pain creasy goes through due to the loss of pita and the sheer passion he has for getting her back you can't help but side with creasy and pull for him to be even more merciless there would be no progress if creasy used diplomacy to deal with the different nefarious gangsters and criminals and he knew that br br creasy's quest ended with the return of pita to her mother and creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys but creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie it in fact enhanced it by showing that creasy was willing to die to get pita back his death was noble in fact br br denzel does an excellent job as do the writers this movie deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie
<START> this is one of those movies that after watching it you will keep thinking about and coming back to even months after viewing the acting is spectacular for starring two children i usually hate movies with whiny kid acting bill paxton is awesome his directorial debut is even better than what i expected of an actor whose most memorable line is game over man game over from the movie aliens br br the best part about the movie is the dichotomy between those scenes where the actors play a family and when they are doing their work it really makes the movie believable and memorable br br keep it up bill i'll be waiting for more movies i m sure to love
<START> red eye a movie that id had wanted to see for awhile cillian murphy plays jack ripner jack the ripper a managerial pose to assassins and his literally killer plan to knock off a highly profiled man and his family br br an everyday woman lisa i think is a normal woman goes to work home worries hates to fly br br the death of her grandmother sends her on a flight which delayed several times br br a flight where she meets jack an ordinary seeming guy until he suavely reveals his profession and plans which coincidentally include her in them she is the key to the keefe's sp death br br she succeeds in saving them but nearly the cost of her life is taken jack is beaten the keefs are saved oh what a story laughs just kidding the movie is really good actually the best of last year there are small things that you have to pay attention to earlier in the movie that play a great importance to the movie later the frankenstein pen i watched it several times before catching all the little jokes and quirks br br a must see for thriller fans no sexual but there is a slight hint the bathroom scene jack thanks for the quicky and the female attendant ohhh its gonna be one of those flights second female attendant hey this isn't a motel you get the idea
<START> if you are wondering where many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the the un israel and international affairs come from look no further br br this isn't a supernatural hollywood film loosely based on some biblical passage instead this movie was made by a company cloud ten pictures with a political and religious agenda as a movie the end result at times more looks like clips out of a televangelism program complete with family prayers and light breaking through church windows while harps are playing br br for mainstream viewers it may be hard to believe but many people believe in this stuff literally as presented in the movie and that perhaps makes the movie important you probably won't find a more concise exposition of the bizarre views of a significant number of your fellow citizens so if you view it view it as a social cultural document if you are at all media savvy you don't need to be warned about the unsubtle attempts at propaganda and manipulation in the movie
<START> sure it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny but at least the filmmakers didn't try while most tv movies border on the brink of mediocrity this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it the cinematography was pretty good for a tv film and viggo mortensen displays shades of aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy but the scene with the mountain lion was intense i was kind of annoyed by jason priestly's role in the film as a rebellious shock jock but then again it's a tv movie despite all of the good things the soundtrack was atrocious however it was nice to see tucson arizona prominently featured in the film
<START> this film is amazing it's just like a nightmare the bizarre story the dark decors the swarming insects everywhere the idea jumps and the surrealistic dreams really great people who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic it seems a little to the films of david lynch the strange story the bizarre dreams the red curtains nuit noire contains almost no plot it's rather a succession of surrealistic happenings nightmares and meetings that's a drawback if the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating denouement i would give it a 10 out of 10 but that's missing and that's why i gave the movie an 8 nuit noire is a film worth watching search that dvd and you'll be rewarded
<START> your mind will not be satisfied by this noÂbudget doomsday thriller but pray who's will a youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as church people br br small apocalyptically themed outing end of the world has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely '50s similar movies and it's not only that but eotw plays like a hybridÂnot only doomsday but convent creeps as well the villain of the movie is a wellÂknown character actor br br this wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of conventÂexploitation that significantly '70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated anyway the convent's secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco christopher lee is the pride of end of the world but the end of the world is not at all his pride
<START> how this film could miss so many of the fascinating complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable an unbelievably thin and unengaging plot ankle deep characterisation motivation and a really awful soundtrack replacing tension with vast swathes of noise replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars then there are the specific references to the original which are merely plastered on over the cracks dreadful in a world where gormless brain dead amerikan remakes of the italian job a tear appears get carter sobs uncontrollably and alfie have desecrated our screens recently this one takes the proverbial biscuit execrable nonsense how ellen burstyn ever got involved is a wonder rubbish
<START> a chemical spill is turning people into zombies it's up to two doctor's to survive the epidemic it's an andreas schnaas film so you know what the par for the course will be bad acting horribly awful special effects and no budget to speak of the dubbing is ridiculous with a capital r and the saddest thing is that i feel compelled to write one word about this piece of excrement much less the ten lines mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by imdb my original review of merely one word crap wouldn't fly so i have to revise it and go more in to how bad it is but i don't know if i can so wait i think i may have enough words or lines rather to make this review pass which is cool i guess so in summation this movie sucks balls don't watch it br br my grade f
