<START> i cherish each and every frame of this beautiful movie it is about regular people people we all know who suffer a little in their life and have some baggage to carry around just like all of us robert deniro ed harris and kathy baker breathe life into their portrayals and are all excellent but harris is especially heartbreaking and therefore very real you would swear he really is a trucker who drinks so he won't have to feel anything baker as his put upon sister also has some delicate moments when deniro gives her flowers in one scene it seems like she was never given flowers before and probably wasn't very worthwhile
<START> the thing about calling house of the dead the worst movie of all time is that it's really not there are worse movies out there i watch alot of hong kong ninja movies that are basically the result of an unfinished japanese police drama having footage of ninjas inserted at the end to create something that could technically be called a movie br br house of the dead is however one of the worst films i've ever seen at the theatres walking out half way through i actually felt i was somewhat dumber for having set through 45 minutes of this piece of garbage
<START> this is a great film br br i first saw this film when it came out i just recently saw this film again and it still holds up to my memory of it a lot of films we watched when we were younger don't seem to hold up when we watch them later in life the film is actually a great 80's example of the type of films made then keaton is at his best all the actors actually did a very good job and ron howard was very good at letting the story push the movie along instead forcing it the pace of the film is fast with few slow spots and seeing the cars from the 80's is too funny being from the 80's i loved seeing the ugly pacer again the film is a great film for any comedy lovers and 80's film lovers
<START> i was lucky enough to have seen this on a whim during a film festival and was smacked so hard with what i saw i returned the next night for its second of three screenings a funny savage and sharp toothed attack on every aspect of mainstream entertainment passively swallowed without tasting by the lowest common denominator target audience waged by a lone avenger journalist who slowly takes in members for his guerilla war on predictability is what the movie's all about and is executed in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that you're left after the credits roll with hope renewed and excited that original films can still be made anyone frustrated with unfulfilled expectations for something to light up their imaginations would do well to hunt and i do mean hunt this scarcely seen item down for fans of fight club and any charlie kaufman film and required viewing for anyone who avoids multiplexes like a rabid dog
<START> some spoilers br br this movie is sometimes subtitled life everlasting that's often taken as reference to the final scene but more accurately describes how dead and buried this once estimable series is after this sloppy and illogical send off br br there's a hey kids let's put on a show air about this telemovie which can be endearing in spots some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances co writer co producer tom fontana and his pals pack the goings on with friends and favorites from other shows as well as real baltimore personages br br that's on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the television's show varied casts your old favorites as well as later non favorites br br there was always a tug of war pitting quality conscious executive producer barry levinson fontana james yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budget conscious nbc execs who simply wanted a another moronic police procedural like nash bridges which regularly beat homicide in the ratings the pressure told as the show bounced between riveting realism that transcended its form and sleazy sensationalism that demeaned it br br unfortunately for this movie fontana co writers yoshimura and eric overmeyer and director jean de segonzac simply threw in the towel they took the most ludicrous story are from the series topped it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new plot line and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast members br br briefly some time has passed since the last episode of the show the former heart of baltimore's homicide unit yaphet kotto as lt al giardello is now a kurt schmoke like candidate for mayor and schmoke himself makes a cameo appearance but this promising start immediately and improbably takes a tragic turn br br the spotlight shifts to giancarlo esposito as giardello's son mike a handsome man who has done good work elsewhere esposito was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly enliven the tv series but the question for viewers always was is mike that uncomfortable as gee's son or is esposito that uncomfortable in the role br br to be fair esposito doesn't get a chance to play out the main story without interruption that's because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that spat on the intelligence of the show's loyal voters br br an apparent snuff streaming video was promoted and then seemed to actually take place on the internet after some red herrings the detectives arrested a repellent suspect but zaljko ivanek's harassed and overworked deputy states attorney forgot to file motions in time and the suspect was released only to be murdered later br br let's summarize he forgot to file the paperwork because it wasn't the most sensational case of his career because the mayor the attorney general the governor the entire maryland legislature the u s attorney general nbc court tv the bbc ap reuters people the sun the washington post the new york times the la times time magazine the times of london the economist the johannesburg mail and guardian l'osservatore romano le figaro paris match l'equipe and computer world weren't calling every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case br br nevertheless the old gang of detectives and associates flocks back to baltimore to help out there's quite an array of talent on display unfortunately with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out some of them are merely on display br br two of the strongest actors clark johnson and melissa leo are criminally underused while time wasted on jon seda and michael michelle could be better spent on commercials the writers do seem to satirize this presenting jason priestley as the latest big deal detective on the other hand they give easy come easy go michelle forbes a very affecting scene br br there's some other sly casting with actual lt gary d'addario the center of the book that gave rise to the show playing another detective guests drop in from other shows like whitney allen doing her deadpan and clueless miss sally from the children's show beloved by the inmates on fontana's oz dina napoli of wbal tv turns up as herself br br even when entertaining though these guests can be distracting ed begley jr actually advances the story in his brief appearance playing dr victor ehrlich from fontana's st elsewhere he's still a vivid character and fits in a hospital setting then you remember didn't st elegius turn out to be an autistic boy's fantasy br br the most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy this movie was made when court tv bought re run rights to the series that network contributed legal waif helen lucaitis who had interviewed the homicide team and later appeared on oz the tv correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news that is plot points for latecomers br br although she's so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways lucaitis also adeptly handles a bit of physical comedy with esposito he shows more juice in his scenes with lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues perhaps those two should have done a spin off br br as the movie winds down the cream of the cast rises to the top although they are saddled with a loser script andre braugher and kyle secor overcome it their performances remind viewers what made homicide for considerable stretches the best show on the air and one of the best television productions ever br br it's fun to watch top pros do their stuff it's just a shame this movie doesn't give them more of a chance die hard fans may want to see this movie anyway but you can live without it
<START> i couldn't agree more with nomad 7's and i a hvr's comments a perfect laid back sunday morning movie the humor is subtle exact opposite of slapstick as one misguided commenter noted br br but what always ceases to amaze me is how often i find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over i originally copied this movie onto vhs about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of those pay cable free weekend previews hbo maybe had never heard of it previously don't know why it wasn't marketed that well when dvd's were released en mass it was one of the first movies i replaced a great combination of cast and writing plus the back drop of montana wilderness doesn't hurt things either beautiful br br it's probably not the type of comedy for everyone but what is if adam sandler type stuff is up your alley this probably won't be your cup of tea this movie needs your full attention the humor is mostly in the dialog br br i believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th but i still know that when it gets to the scenes like the one where the hoods of the police cars start blowing off i'm going to loose it ed o'neill's face is priceless recommended 110
<START> a hot headed cop accidentally kills a murder suspect and then covers up the crime but must deal with a guilty conscience while he tries to solve a murder case andrews and tierney are reunited with director preminger in a film noir that is as effective as laura their earlier collaboration andrews is perfectly cast as the earnest cop a good guy caught up in unfortunate circumstances the acting is fine all around including malden as a tough police captain and tully as tierney's protective father the screenplay by hecht a great and prolific screenwriter is taut and suspenseful and preminger creates a great atmosphere
<START> eddie murphy for best supporting actor what an insult to alan arkin and djimon hounsou br br jamie foxx who can act walks through this film like a zombie br br beyonce that was acting br br this movie pales in comparison to chicago or just about any other recent musical br br if it were not for the great singing and performance of jennifer hudson i would have given this a zero br br and no i never saw the stage play so i am not making the typical broadway vs hollywood rap
<START> i was young film student in 1979 when the union of the soviet filmmakers came to sofia bulgaria and premiered konchalovsky's siberiade tarkosvky's stalker and danelia'a autumn marathon i was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form then and only then i saw siberiade 4 and 1 2 hours epic and was speechless way better then bertolucci's 1900 by far br br hope andron will somehow get to the negative and make director's restored version full lenght someday on dvd of course also i fiercely fought in defense of this cinema against most of my colleagues who were equating soviet film with bad taste time is on my side
<START> the movie looked like a walk through for immoral study most likely i never got much involved with the burning need of the female artist to immortalize male nudes and thus all that fuss about now who drew this penis sounded a bit gratuitous dialogues in this movie are rather dreadful albeit visually this movie got its moments i almost dig it when tassi got into painting a mental picture but then movie weered back onto penises highly recommended to those who has not seen one in a while
<START> feeding the masses was just another movie trying to make a little money off of the zombie craze that is going around mostly due to the popularity of movies such as land of the dead and the resident evil series br br it starts at a television station which is guarded by the military and are reporting that the lazarus virus zombies are close to containment and the city will soon be free to do their business again the problem is this is totally false zombies are running rampantly and only a small minority of people are aware among them are torch william garberina the camera man sherry rachael morris the lead anchor woman who for some reason is listed as playing shelly on this website and roger patrick cohen their military escort torch and sherry are against lying to the people but the station is being run by secret service or some other government agency and they are heavily censored br br this movie gives itself a pat on the back on the box cover saying we hold feeding the masses on a higher level than any o the three 'of the dead' films by george a rombero the source of that quote has lost all credibility with me br br let me just say that this movie is bad i don't mean bad like i was expecting more i obviously was though but i mean bad in that i could not find any redeeming qualities in the film whatsoever the acting in all parts are either over done or too wooden did anybody remember their lines or are they reading off of cue cards i can't even think of what the best part of the movie was or the best actor actress there really was not one if i had to give a nod to someone i would say roger the military escort was probably the most interesting character but that is really not saying much br br i would have to recommend to pass on this movie despite the box cover looking pretty good it's what originally drew me to the movie 3 10
<START> all you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten then they start rolling the title credits you see slugs in big letters followed shortly thereafter by the movie whew i was worried i had accidentally tuned into slugs the musical or slugs the game show anyway from there the movie deteriorates into a kill fest you see a guy cut his hand off because he had slugs in his gardening glove two people get attacked by slugs while having sex and a girl falling on her back in an underground passageway get stung to death by killer slugs it's a pretty silly movie falling in the so bad it's good category it also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that you're shocked to learn it was made in 1988 my guess was 1974 i'm very surprised it has received as high a score as it has here because most people here don't give those types of movie any love but if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable this is one of your prime candidates
<START> i've always liked johnny concho and i wish this film were out on vhs and dvd frank sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this one br br when we first meet frank in the film's title role he's the brother of a notorious gunfighter who's out of town at the moment the brother strikes terror in the heart's of the town and frank takes full advantage of that to bully the townspeople safe and secure in his shadow only phyllis kirk has any feeling for him she's the daughter of storekeeper wallace ford and dorothy adams br br two other gunmen arrive william conrad and christopher dark and it turns out conrad has killed sinatra's brother and he's coming to his town to take over they humiliate sinatra and run him out of town kirk follows him br br overnight sinatra turns from punk into coward and becomes a man searching for some kind of backbone it's a well acted performance almost as good as his oscar nominated role in the man with a golden arm pity for some reason this has not been seen for years br br two other performances of note are keenan wynn as former gunfighter turned preacher who helps sinatra find what he needs to stand up to conrad and dark and then there is conrad in what i believe was his career role on screen he's a villain of incredible malevolence pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screen br br however what i like about johnny concho is the climax an unforgettable one where conrad and dark are dealt with let's just say i believe johnny concho was mgm's answer to high noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break down in all law and order
<START> i think that the movie was kind of weird in the opening scene a person is killed for no reason he doesn't get mentioned again the special effects could have also be better but i enjoyed watching an older horror movie it isn't the best example of a classic horror movie but it still was an alright movie i give it about a 5 out of 10 of the scale
<START> the education of little tree is just not as good as it could have been little tree's education is about things like the circle of life and how you should look at a star to help you whatever happened to the three r's readin' 'ritin' and 'rithmetic when the idiot back talks the teacher at the boarding school place he starts crying and talking to the sky oh my gosh sure the lady was a little harsh but then james cromwell's character comes and takes him away leaving the audience thinking that little tree was absolutely right he should learn to adapt to new discipline those were the times talking to a star is not going to change a thing little tree needs to learn that his adoring guardians are not always right
<START> i can't believe john died while filming an episode he collapsed on set read this out of his biography online john ritter was born in burbank calafornia on september 17th 1948 br br he landed his last television role in 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter 2002 based on the popular book on this sitcom he played paul hennessey a loving yet rational dad who laid down the ground rules for his three children the show was a ratings winner in its first season and won a peoples choice award for best new comedy and also won for favorite comedy series by the family awards while working 8 simple rules he also starred in his second to last film manhood 2003 br br that same year while john was rehearsing for the 4th 3rd series episode of 8 simple rules now shortened he fell ill henry winkler described it as john looked like he had food poisoning then he collapsed on the set he was quickly rushed to a nearby hospital the same burbank hospital where he was born he was diagnosed with an aorta dissection an unrecognized heart flaw he underwent surgery but did not make it john ritter died at age 54 just 1 week away from his 55th birthday leaving his wife amy yasbeck and 4 children
<START> the statistics in this movie were well researched there is no doubt about it al gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got al gore is certainly quite an actor he sounds so concerned but actions speak louder than words throughout this movie there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie br br jimmy carter unlike al gore is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk but walks the walk as well when carter thought we needed to conserve energy he turned down the thermostat in the white house and got warm by wearing a sweater br br al gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet how much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create how much energy does it take to heat gore's swimming pool behind his mansion it would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used but if we did the power company would react to a 50 reduction of energy by calling it a 50 loss in revenue and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50 so just turning it off would not be a very good idea br br this movie is a veiled appeal to allow big goivernment to take control of everything in the name of saving planet earth that is
<START> if you want your vision of chaplin limited to a lovable tramp and you get your belly laughs from pathos watch something else if however you love slapstick comedy as performed by one of the best do watch this one br br the image is of the tramp who really cannot get the girl he spots another couple kissing on a park bench and he has a blast ruining their fun br br this is one of chaplin's park comedies filmed in mack sennett's park with pickpockets and cops and couples these shorts work as the format allows chaplin to shine as he weaves through predicaments br br i checked the box as this could be considered a spoiler though it's not if you've seen these films everyone ends up in the pond except chaplin he gets the girl who in this case was played by minta durfee a k a mrs roscoe fatty arbuckle
<START> diego armando maradona had been sixteen years of age in 1978 when argentina won the world cup at home he was already the biggest star and the greatest player in a country obsessed with football everybody had begged cesar luis menotti to play the boy genius but the manager thought that he was not yet ready br br history records that argentina won the 1978 world cup fairly convincingly they hadn't really needed maradona the same was not true in 1982 spain was a catalogue of disaster for argentina menotti still chain smoking played diego this time but the occasion was too much for such a temperamental boy maradona had signed for barcelona on june 4 1982 for around 7 million nine days later he played his first game at the camp nou and belgium beat argentina one nil it was not an auspicious debut and even though he scored twice against hungary in the next match maradona will remember the mundial as the site of his nadir a crude petulant foul on brazil's batista in the second round that abruptly ended his tournament and argentina's reign as world champions br br but now that was all behind him maradona had muddled his way through some crazy times at barca and left in 1984 to join napoli it was as if he was finally home the neapolitan tifosi had done everything to entice maradona to poor underachieving napoli gifts from old women and pocket money from young boys nestled uncomfortably with the camorra's millions as part of the transfer fee and the city was determined to make him feel at home so for the time being at least maradona was el rey he brought his argentine side to mexico as one of the favourites and with a new manager carlos bilardo replacing menotti br br maradona is the hero of this story a one man world cup winning machine in 1982 hundreds of young men had died in a pointless battle for the falkland isles now the british press yearned for a rematch with the same result in mexico city maradona was still regarded with distinction in england remembered more for a superb performance in britain during a 1980 tour than for spain but he was still an argie the enemy br br england actually started well and lineker could have scored after only twelve minutes a key event happened on 8 minutes fenwick the big and limited english defender was booked he was now terrified of making any challenges around the penalty area br br after a tense first 45 minutes the second half started with a bang maradona danced forward after 50 minutes but could find no way through similarly valdano's attempt hit only white shirts then the moment of infamy that serves as diego's epitaph hodge bizarrely hooked the ball back into his own penalty area shilton hurriedly jumped to claim but there was maradona somehow rising above the english goalkeeper to thrust the ball into the net how had he done it simple handball br br the most famous foul in football history passed in near slow motion every spectator waited for mr al sharif of syria to blow for the foul he didn't shilton looked and appealed to the linesman he ran back to the centre circle unless he assassinates the pope or becomes the first man to step foot on mars when the great man dies this moment will be shown first in long lingering slow motion followed by the look of glee on his face the next image will be his next gift to the world the world cup's finest goal br br burruchaga stroked the ball to maradona who was ambling around on the right hand side of his own half he span and accelerated away from beardsley and reid this was the real diego he burst through butcher and attacked fenwick fenwick now had the opportunity to stop the attack normally he would have aimed his boot somewhere near maradona's thigh sure he would have picked up a red card but who cares then fenwick had a brainwave he hesitated and decided to run at maradona waving his arms perhaps he was trying to put him off diego shot into the box as fenwick fell over butcher had been running alongside the genius as if he was offering encouragement shilton charged out in panic and maradona twisted around him and prepared to score now butcher remembered his role and tried to cripple the argentinean instead he gave extra impetus to the shot which smashed into the goal england were coming home br br during this magical mexican summer the world had found a successor for pele in fact the greatest ever footballer had been surpassed pele had been superb in 1958 and 1970 but had had great players all around him maradona did not 1986 was his world cup
<START> vampires vs zombies wasn't the original title it was actually br br nasty lesbian semi vampires and two zombies getting hit by cars special guest appearances by bob the lesbian gypsie witch and her dog random woman with special powers and the catholic school girl short skirt zombie choir br br also on the box warning no plot only the writer and director will understand the end or anything else in this movie br br seriously though i love bad movies i love vampires i love zombies hell i even enjoy the lesbians this movie combined all three with a vague and confusing or non existent plot horrendous i mean really bad dialogue and random stuff and people that have nothing to do with anything or do they i didn't know what in the world was going on oh and i can't forget the green oatmeal 'zombies' in latex gloves yes the film makers were so cheap they couldn't even cover their zombies hands in oatmeal and paint any way the result was this excruciatingly bad film if you could even call it that br br was the end supposed to not make sense the vampire was really nurse and the other girl was really a mental patient where were the vampires vs zombies hell where were the vampires at all you really couldn't call any of the girls vampires whatever br br don't ever rent or buy this movie if you are really curious okay i'll understand seriously even lovers of bad movies won't be able to stand this one it should be number 1 on the bottom 100
