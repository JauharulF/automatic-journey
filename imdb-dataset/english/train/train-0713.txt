<START> 1940 a visit to the lodz ghetto in nazi occupied poland recorded by a german cameramen with the naive co operation of the jewish community is combined with archival footage clips from international newsreels and excerpts from related cultural films to portray the world's jews as swindlers and parasites this 'documentary' interprets jewish life from the viewpoint of traditional anti semitism and nazi ideology a candid cinematically unique expression of racial hatred i personally find this film frightening and highly offensive one can only hope that such pictures as this will never reach the screen again
<START> the end of violence and certainly the million dollar hotel hinted at the idea the wenders has lost his vision his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture the land of plenty seals the coffin i'm afraid by being a vastly unimaginative obviously sentimental and clichÃ©'d film the characters are entirely flat and stereotyped the writing plot and direction are amateurish at best for the first time in quite a while i was impatient for the film to end so i could get on with my life the war torn delirium of the uncle the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusion it all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen what happened the days of experimentation perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him i'm afraid let's hope he finds his inspiration again at the toronto film festival which is where i saw the film wenders was there to introduce it completely lacking in humility he offered us the following i hope no wait i know you're going to enjoy the next two hours i'm afraid he couldn't be more wrong
<START> raggedy ann andy is the first movie i ever saw in the theaters my dad took my sister and i and the funny thing is when we got home dad asked us what do you want to do now and we said we want to watch raggedy ann andy again lol and my dad actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again at least that's how i remember it i was five years old at the time br br this movie was pretty scary for a five year old the scene with the giant ocean of sweets and the hypnotic camel scene i don't remember a lot from this film naturally the beginning was magical and a few scenes i wish i could find it again and will likely seek it out now br br i remember i loved raggedy ann andy

<START> i just caught an episode about brad the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started i have to say that the story about his biking career was more heart breaking than his drug addiction here's this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an olympic training team for two weeks and immediately upon arriving he insults lance armstrong one of the greatest athletes who ever lived and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general understandably he is soon asked to leave most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back but what i wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass br br at any rate i was confused about how the show was put together since it shows brad at the height of his addiction we see footage of him pan handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine i didn't even know that was legal to show but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn his life around and give them some material for a good tv episode br br at any rate it is an enlightening show because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people's lives sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict's indifference although i have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean cut there are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost but still and maybe i should warn about spoilers here everything has a little too much of a happily ever after feel at the end and i have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life but still it's a show about people trying to help other people and you can never complain too much about something like thatÂ
<START> it's always difficult to put a stamp on any film as being 'the best ' whether of all time a certain genre or what have you but i believe a strong argument could be made that in fact laputa is the greatest animated film ever made it is in my mind the masterwork of hayao miyazaki the most talented of japan's animated directors and it best captures his strengths as a director storyteller and designer as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes the version i'm reviewing is the 2003 american dub i know sacrilege for a hard core anime fan to not watch it in its native language there is at least one other english language dub out there i have it on vhs i have no idea from what source and that version is the single best dub i have ever encountered of any film but i thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find br br laputa tells the story of a boy named pazu voiced by james van der beek here who's growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named sheeta anna paquin literally drops from the sky it seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent colonel muska mark hamill who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck to keep things lively there's also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal led by the aging but still boisterous dola cloris leachman the plot revolves around the crystal's ability to reveal the location of the fabled flying city of laputa a potential treasure trove of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure it's all very much in keeping with a fairy tale setting but miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story and the plot is peppered with 'gosh wow' moments and threaded with his customary morality and warnings about abusing the power of nature br br the design work on laputa nearly twenty years later is still revolutionary flying machines of all sorts abound utterly impossible but so meticulously designed that you instantly accept them without blinking the world is set somewhere around the start of the twentieth century with telegraphs and ancient motorcars alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines but it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution laputa is both the garden of eden and the fire of heaven itself and in that juxtaposition lies its appeal its power and its danger br br besides being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography from sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water laputa displays a scope that most films Â even with the magic of cgi Â can only daydream about though we only see a small fraction of this world its simple elegance extends beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it the film also contains one of my favorite if not the most exciting action sequences ever a guardian robot that fell to earth is accidentally reactivated and wreaks havoc on the fortress it is kept in all the while trying to protect sheeta who was the one who woke it up meanwhile pazu and the pirates swoop in on their little flying machines to snatch her literally from the jaws of destruction from the horrific sight of the robot incinerating the countryside to the exhilarating last second rescue the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience br br it helps that laputa has an amazing score composer joe hisaishi captures the wondrous beauty of this world the dewy innocence the exciting action and the creepy otherworldliness of the flying city and its bizarre robot guardians though he re recorded it for this dvd release which imo is not an improvement over his original score adding pieces here and there the score matches the visuals perfectly a rare total union of sound and vision br br this isn't a bad dub i'm inordinately fond of the older english dub and this one over explains things just a tad in spots but i was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those and those matched the japanese pretty well dola in particular is hard to get right but leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman her sons aren't quite as good as the original paquin does a good job as sheeta and mark hamill while i knew it was him early is more than talented enough to do muska i liked the other english dub of muska a little more but hamill's good much of the film rests on pazu's shoulders and van der beek is wonderful listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other english dub because vdb matches up very closely with the original pazu although again watching a dub is grounds for excommunication among the otaku faithful as much as i love this film i don't think you're sacrificing a great deal simply watching this particular anglicized version john lassiter of pixar introduces it up front and my suspicion is that he like so many others simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality br br miyazaki has had success in america in recent years with spirited away and mononoke one of his few films i didn't care for but to me laputa is still his crowning achievement anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work and again this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every cylinder i'd pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen while that will probably never happen it's good to know that at least this classic has been preserved on dvd
<START> amazing grace has a languid feel to it as it tells a contemporary story of various lives in an apartment building the language spoken is hebrew but the drama could take place in any modern city it observes family values romantic relationships and age group characteristics with equal aplomb it does not judge the characters only present them in a straight forward manner as they strive to work out their individual problems in this modern world the quality of acting is very good and the observations made on the characters are astute and sharp i appreciate this flowing film very much
<START> even when i saw this movie at a teenager i wondered just how ironic it was that pia zadora starred in a movie about an artist who slept her way to the top as beautiful and sexy as ms zadora is even she couldn't keep this sorry ass excuse of a movie from tanking not even her photoshoot for penthouse in which the lonely lady was promoted back in the day could keep this movie from tanking the only thing that could have saved this movie a completely different script give this one a miss
<START> the world may have ended unfortunately this film survived as yet another testament to canada's inability to make movies that go beyond the execrable maybe it's because all our really good people norman jewison martin short et al go to hollywood in fact it's too bad short wasn't cast in this apallingly pretentious and banal film he might have given it some credibility the canadian government should realize and this movie is a magnificent example that shovelling money into the trough does not result in good cinema if the people lapping up these public funds had had to compete they might have been forced to come up with something worthwhile as it is they have produced yet another snickering embarassment
<START> this is an above average jackie chan flick due to the fantastic finale and great humor however other then that it's nothing special all the characters are pretty cool and the film is entertaining throughout plus jackie chan is simply amazing in this jackie and wai man chan had fantastic chemistry together and are both very funny and i thought the main opponent looked really menacing however the dubbing was simply terrible the character development is above average for this sort of thing and the main fight is simply fantastic plus some of the bumps jackie takes in this one are harsh there is a lot of really silly and goofy humor in this but it amused me and the ending is hilarious plus all the characters are quite likable it's pretty cheap looking but generally very well made and while it does not have the amount of fighting you would expect from a jackie chan flick it does enough to keep you watching plus one of my favorite moments in this film is when jackie dragon and wai man chan tiger are playing around with a rifle and it goes off this is an above average jackie chan flick due to the fantastic finale and great humor however other then that it's nothing great still it's well worth the watch the direction is good jackie chan does a good job here with solid camera work fantastic angles and keeping the film at a fast pace for the most part the acting is very good jackie chan is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable hilarious as usual does some crazy stunts had fantastic chemistry with wai man chan kicked that ass and played this wonderful cocky character he was amazing i just wished they would stop dubbing him jackie rules wai man chan is funny as jackie's best friend i really liked him he is also a very good martial artist rest of the cast do ok i guess overall well worth the watch out of 5
<START> first and foremost speaking as no fan of the genre the bourne ultimatum is a breathtaking virtuoso superb action movie br br secondly it is a silly malarky of cartoonish super hero stuff br br thirdly the film carries a complex important point about crime fighters turning into criminals themselves no reference is made to abu ghraib or the executive branch's outrageous domestic assaults on constitutional rights none is necessary br br so the latest in the bourne series in the hands of paul greengrass of the 2004 bourne supremacy and last year's united 93 is a significant achievement perhaps held back but not actually diminished by the unavoidable excesses of the genre br br breathtaking above is meant both as a complimentary adjective and a description of the physical sensation for more than an hour from the first frame the viewer seemingly holds his breath pushed back against the chair by the force of relentless globe trotting utterly suspenseful action there is no letup no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some kindred music videos do after just a couple of minutes br br oliver wood's in your face cinematography is making the best of tony gilroy's screenplay from robert ludlum's 1990 novel which doesn't stack up well against the bourne identity written a decade earlier br br matt damon is once again the inevitable irreplaceable bourne the deadliest of fantasy cia agents this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity his past and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine nothing like his quietly heroic edward r murrow the always marvelous david strathairn is the nasty top agency official pitched against bourne in trying to hide some illegal take no prisoners policies and brutal procedures br br joan allen plays what appears to be the good cop against strathairn's bad one and there is julia stiles as the agent once again coming to bourne's aid a combination of greengrass' direction and stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue br br so good is the bourne ultimatum that it gets away with the old one man against the world bit this time stretched to ridiculous excesses as bourne defies constraints of geography time gravity and physics in general can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building why not it looks great br br all this real world magic leaping from country to country in seconds to arrive at some unknown location exactly as when and how needed outdoes special effect and superhero cartoon improbabilities and yet only a clueless pedant would allow facts interfere with the entertainment based ecstasy of the bourne fantasy
<START> to be fair they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence but the dialogue was more cheesy than 9lbs of emmental and the cgi was a little old hat now maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the film a little better too to say this was awful is to do this film a mis service if you want to see something that is totally execrable you gotta sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching 'sickle' that is soo mind numbingly awful its actually good several large alcoholic beverages are deriguer though any road up i enjoyed this film and its gotta be worth a look if you have not seen it yet just don't expect anything along the lines of 'jurassic park the lost world' or 'apocalypto'
<START> this is one of the worst movies i saw i dunno what are the reasons for shoting suck a crap don't waste your time watching this good actors but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues hope there'll be no blanche 2 avoid this movie by all means
<START> this has to be one of my favourite flicks unlike the weak 'elvira's haunted hills' anyway i love the way the movie is a goth com 'wizard of oz' story br br elvira is a goth dorothy who is stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of a good witch elviras aunt morgana she inherits a ruby ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by the bad warlock her uncle she befriends four characters whom she inadvertently helps grow throughout the movie all the while with a dog in tow there is a show down with her uncle the wicked witch of the west where elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up defeating him in the end she gets sent off by the towns folk after winning over their hearts and finally gets to her destination las vegas dorothy's home in kansas br br there are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters elvira youe must be aunt em and you must be uncle remus there's no place like home there's no place like home bad uncle vinny i'll get you my pretty and your little dog too br br there is a sign that elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of kansas br br but aside from this the fact that one of the sequences she ripped off um i mean was inspired by flashdance is pure genius and if you don't roll around laughing at her titty twirling at the end of her very 80's las vegas show then you haven't got a camp bone in your body this movie is a cult camp classic
<START> the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off however i was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this comedy central gem i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in strangers with candy sarah's character is a true sociopath very comparable to sedaris' jerri blank br br the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast her sister's character is good funny at times but ultimately meant not to steal sarah's show however the rest of the cast is extremely sub par in comparison br br i'm glad though that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor
<START> this was a great movie with a good story my children 10 7 5 and 4 all loved this movie including myself the music was also fantastic no the horses do not talk but instead the story is told by spirit and to hear a story told by a horse's point if view was fun br br i think the title says it all spirit this movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends i would have to say my 4 year old boy and 5 year old girl were really touched by this movie and even got so into it they laughed so hard and they cheered for spirit in the end br br enjoy spirit with your family and have your spirit lifted with this heartwarming story your kids will love it i think you will too
<START> this was longer than the ten commandments all lord of the rings and the matrix trilogy combined my oh my what a nightmare this is the single biggest over hype of 2006 there is not a moment that is not scripted and clichÃ©d movie musicals can be done brilliantly and bring genuine excitement to the viewer dreamgirls takes the route of chinese water torture in the form of endless music montages shoddy acting and poor directing choices seriously mr condon did you have to do the old billboard countdown shots it's at 58 no wait look its rising up the charts and here is the passing billboard notice to show you again and again and again
<START> the movie holly is the story of a young girl who has been sold by her poor family and smuggled across the border to cambodia to work as a prostitute in the infamous k11 red light village in the movie holly is waiting to be sold at a premium for her virginity when she meets patrick who is losing money and friends through gambling and bar fights patrick and holly have an immediate bond over their stubbornness but this is all disrupted when holly is sold to a child trafficker and disappears as movie goers we are then thrust into patrick's pursuit to find holly again holly then shows her willingness to leave this lifestyle but her confusion on what is right and wrong holly carries us through the beautiful and harsh cambodia while discovering that holly is not just one girl she is the voice of millions of children who are exploited and violated every year with no rights or protection br br holly is less extreme than its subject matter might suggest such as documentaries that involve 4 year olds and sexual trafficking but does manage to shed considerable light on cambodian vietnamese trafficking of children into prostitution it is a moving story that helps to shed light on the horrible situation in which many children face and their struggles to trust and realize what is right and wrong br br patrick the antagonist of the film is an american dealer of stolen artifacts who is also losing money and friends while playing cards and getting into bar fights while on a journey his motorbike runs out of fuel and he is forced to rent a room at a brothel during his stay he comes across holly a twelve year old girl who has been sold by her parents and is being abducted into slavery and prostitution holly and patrick begin a friendship of trust and understanding he discovers a clever stubborn girl beneath the traumatized exterior and becomes determined to save her though their strictly platonic relationship is misinterpreted by almost everyone they meet when she suddenly disappears he starts a journey to track her down without having thought if he can really help her br br holly is able to escape on her way to another brothel when she jumps from the truck and runs into a field filled with mines a mine is set off by a cow and the truck driver believes she is dead so holly is then left on her own during patrick's journey to find holly he meets a social worker who tries to talk some sense into him and shares the facts with him that haunts the cambodian region the idea of paying for her freedom simply fuels the demand she explains 30 000 children in prostitution in cambodia next year it could be 60 000 i'm not trying to save 60 000 he tells her i'm trying to save one patrick discovers that the idea of whisking her to safety is quickly put to rest when the social worker tells him that the us will not let him adopt and although it takes five minutes to 'save' a child it takes five years to reintegrate her into society patrick is not affected by the information and he continues his quest to find holly br br the audience is then shown that holly makes it to a small town and is foraging for food with other homeless children she is then befriended by a local policemen who seem little better than criminals with a badge when they sell her to another brothel and then make a deal to a vietnamese businessman who then takes her virginity holly then seems to think that this is her destiny and when patrick finally find her she is willing to yum yum and boom boom her distant friend patrick is utterly confused by this change in behavior but he is not deterred in his plan to take her away from this world in the end he steals her away and brings her to a safe land in the comfort of the social worker holly is given fresh clothes if feed and brought to a dance class but she is forbidden to see patrick this intense yearning to be in the comfort of patrick's friendship she runs away from the safe house and back onto the streets in cambodia br br meanwhile patrick is dealing with the decision to leave the country and flee back to the united states or to stay in cambodia his thoughts continue to revert back to holly and during a visit to a bar an older male sees the picture he is holding and comments on his sexual appetite when he had sex with her this enrages patrick and he hits the man and runs out of the bar eventually patrick is caught by the police in the eyes of holly who is hiding behind a pole br br the movie holly may make the audience want to donate money towards organizations that improve the life for these poor youngsters and even campaign to reduce the amount of brothels in the region but the film's dramatic weaknesses may reduce its chances of being seen by enough people to make a difference overall i think the concept is better as a documentary and it was not as touching as a movie the actors did a great job of showing their raw emotion and the true confusion of the youngsters who are affected by this lifestyle but in the end the harsh lifestyle of the region and the desperate notions of the parents who sell their children to uphold their own starvation does nothing to help the children's situations
<START> it was life changing it really was the man in the moon is a breathtaking experience to watch the acting was fabulous the story line was great and this was a perfect start for reese witherspoon's career i don't see how anyone couldn't love this film sure it's not the best movie ever even though it was close to it but it was highly amusing to watch and i even had a big laugh at one of the jokes and a lot of other little laughs of course there was some cry your heart out moments too but this movie was enlightening and it brightens up your day although you have to get a little depressed from the story every now and then i can't believe this movie didn't win at least one award and i also can't believe that it's been seen by so little people on this site see this movie if you haven't for it is definitely touching
<START> i tried i really did i thought that maybe if i gave joao pedro rodrigues another chance i could enjoy his movie i know that after seeing o fantasma i felt ill and nearly disgusted to the core but some of the reviews were quite good and in favor so i was like what the hell at least you didn't pay 10 dollars at the quad give it a shot br br sometimes it's better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthetic to alleviate the horror of so much pain i often wonder if it wouldn't be better to go back to my childhood and demand my former bullies to really let me have it on other occasions i often think that the world is really flat and that if i sail away far enough i will not only get away from it all but fall clear over and that some evil lovecraftian thing will snatch me with its 9000 tentacles and squeeze the life and some french fries from 1995 still lingering inside my esophagus out of me br br is there a reason for odete i'd say not at all just that maybe her creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness one that makes alex forrest look like strawberry shortcake look not only creepy but flat out sick to the bone she first of all decides to leave her present boyfriend in shrieking hysterics because she wants a child and he believes they're too young she later crashes a funeral of a gay man and get this in order to get closer to him she feigns being pregnant while insinuating herself into the lives of the dead man's mother and lover in the sickest of ways oh of course she shrieks like a banshee and throws herself not one but a good three times on his grave and there's this ridiculous business that she progressively becomes pedro which sums up some weak as bad tea explanation that love knows no gender or something br br i'd say she's as nuts as a can of cashews unsalted but then again so's the director and me for taking a chance on this at least the men look good other than that not much else to see here
