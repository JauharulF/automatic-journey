<START> why didn't dynamo have any pants where did they go it was never explained that's why this movie was so awesome plus starsky gave his kids the aids great acting too richard dawson deserved to win best supporting actor a i d s my favorite line from the movie was that hit the spot a i d s this movie was for the birds i tried to give this movie the stinkeye but it continued playing what am i doing wrong i thought the hateboat was funnnny lol i would like that for a show why wasn't dynamo wearing pants i know his arm was skewered but what's up with those crazy futur nets why didn't that family feud guy ray combs get a net he could have used one aidsssss
<START> there was a reasonably good looking girl starring the film zoe mclellan but even her looks couldn't stop me from voting it the lowest possible one br br the plot is bad and irrational br br what more can i say the movie sucks
<START> well overall this movie was pretty much worthless and it's basically a horror movie that ended up being more of a comedy i just rented this movie last night when me and my friends went to blockbuster looking for a scary movie this definitely wasn't what we were looking for but it satisfied us for humor the actors in this movie especially brandon are so fake that it's funny and especially that tracy girl whenever she's in the boarded up room telling the clown to go away they show almost no emotion and it's just so obvious that they're acting and also when the clown is looking through that black box paper thing and grabs mark he doesn't even look like he's scared even though the clown like grabbed him and started attacking him and seriously would you just be jogging if you were being chased down i'd be sprinting for my life even though anyone could probably outrun that clown because he's like 300 lbs not to mention that the effects aren't that great like whenever the clown chops off susan's head in the forest then whenever he throws her head into the boarded up room with denise and tracy whenever denise throws the head back over also like in the previous guy's comment the beginning makes absolutely no sense and i don't even see why it was even included in the movie so what was this movie made in 2003 the music made it sound like it was made in like the 1980's and the camera ing doesn't even really look professional half of the time it seems like the camera can't even stay steady when it's suppose to be overall i'd have to say i enjoyed the movie i wouldn't recommend it though if you're trying to find something to scare you but if you're looking for something to maybe make fun of or get a laugh out of i'd recommend it for sure
<START> by reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing you know the type funny but supposed to frighten you this was not funny or horrific the writing was lame the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme mundaneness they were so expected the actors didn't even do much with such a not so good script at least i hope that wasn't their best watch this movie at your own risk i give it negative 3 stars outta 10
<START> there's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this lady death the motion picture just plain sucks aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980's cartoon based on a line of action figures the bad guy himself even talks like a skeletor wannabe has the obligatory inept henchman and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old saturday morning blackstar cartoon just don't expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue at other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai yet there is no sex no tentacle rape thank goodness and very little sex appeal this despite the physical appearance of the title character there is simply no adult edge to this material unless you count the half naked heroine and bloody deaths essentially what we have here is a feature length episode of she ra princess of power but with skimpier clothes and more gore
<START> getting to work on this film when it was made back in the summer of 1990 shot partly in the biltmore estate in asheville nc and the remaining parts in winston salem the massive offices of the rj reynolds were used in several office scenes and places in around the beautiful city that is know as the tulip capital of the world winston salem i enjoyed my work although it was exceedingly hard work building all the sets like the golf of mexico where renee russo and jim belushi went on their date i also had a big hand in decorating the bar where larry encounters the magical bartender mr destiny i tacked all those pics on the wall of sports heroes and decorated that phone booth where larry makes a phone call for a cab i even put my mothers photo at eye level so i could freeze frame it and show it to her when we watched it i remember dyeing the grass at his old house with green dye because it first had to be sodded it was a new house in a new development and i guess they leased it for the movie then i had to cut that newly laid sod to make it look nice man that was hard as far as the movie when we made it we had no idea what it would be like but after seeing it i fell in love with it because really tells the story of what if as good as i ever had seen it including the great it's a wonderful life i cried so many times br br i can't count i got to meet the wonderful actor michael caine while shooting scenes at an old minor league ballpark where larry's boyhood scenes were played and replayed i remember after he had done a take an was heading back to his trailer i ran him down and asked him for a picture and he was quite amiable and said why not he is a good guy and a really natural and forceful actor i can't say the same for jim belushi he was so full of himself smoking big cuban cigars and talking loudly so br br everyone in earshot could hear his every word his career never did take off but he has had a decent tv career recently i would say watch this movie if you ever get the chance it's wonderful and really heartfelt and real you can feel larry's pain after he enters into the new world mr destiny gives him after hitting the homer and as he wants so badly for people to believe he is not this bad guy everyone thinks he is they all think he belongs in a nuthouse but eventually he wins people over but by then he wants his real life back so badly especially his wonderful wife played so beautifully by linda hamilton and he wants his dog back so see it
<START> this movie is not great but it is a good and enjoyable one it feels like an indie film made out of a play script morgan freeman basically plays himself although the director swears the script was not written for him and there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he hasn't committed to yet i mean he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it br br i found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste but refreshing nonetheless this is a film that inspires the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go a bit too much emphasis on appearance if you ask me br br bottom line a nice little film made in two weeks with basically two actors and a few extras dialogue driven makes morgan freeman look good
<START> this movie is totally wicked it's really great to see mjh in a different role than her sabrina character the plot is totally cool and the characters are excellently written definitely one of the best movies
<START> i can say nothing more about this movie than man this sucks if you really hate yourself and want to do some severe damage to your brain watch this movie it's the best cure in the world for taking away happiness when i started watching this film i was completely happy afterwords i could feel my brain melting like it was struck by molten lava god i hate that stupid dinosaur so if you want severe brain damage watch this movie it will do the trick
<START> i really liked batman dead end i thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance collora could make a fine film this trailer didn't quite give me the same impression the story line or potential story line was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good tv movie or television show br br first michael o'hearn is not that good a superman i actually thought he in his brief appearance made a decent clark kent sorry i just don't think of superman as being that buff the suit kent wore masked his size batman may have the body of a bodybuilder but not superman supes is toned no doubt but not bulk anyway i didn't care for all his posing and his transformation from kent to superman seemed cheezy now this may not be just o'hearn's fault collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction br br second the special effects for flying were cheezy superman flies through the sky if was obvious that this superman flew close to the ground with the telephone cables and buildings visible above him i don't think there were any full body shots of superman flying evidently the harness and rigging supporting o'hearn must have been located on his lower torso br br all in all it was a good trailer i'd probably pay to see a film if ever made and would be sure to catch it on television the story line an alliance between lexcorp and wayne industries superman jealous of lois's attraction to wayne lex and twoface teaming to beat superman and the joining of forces between batman superman is a good one i'm sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film collora and company even o'hearn could deliver a decent film certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of hollywood lately
<START> i grew up watching the old inspector gadget cartoon as a kid it was like get smart for kids bumbling boob can't solve any case and all the work is done by the walking talking dog brain and his niece penny i had heard the live action movie was decent so i checked it out at the library i rented this movie for free and felt i should have been paid to see this br br broderick comes nowhere near the caliber of acting don adams had as the voice of gadget his voice was all wrong the girl who played penny looked nothing like the cartoon penny she is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails but she does do a decent job given what she had to work with dabney coleman gives a good performance as cheif quimby saldy he never hid in any odd place or had exploding messages tossed at him accidently by gadget br br the gadget mobile was wrong it never talked in the series and it did fine why did they do this br br gadget was too intelligent in this film in the show he was a complete idiot here he had a halfway decent intellect it would have worked better if he was a moron br br also the completely butchered the catchphrase borderick says wowser it is and should always be wowsers it sounds lame with out the 's' i got upset when they showed the previews and they didn't have the correct phrase br br the only decent gags were during the credits the lacky for claw is in front of a support group for recovering henchmen sidekicks seated in the audience is mr t richard keil aka jaws of bond movie fame a herve villacheze look alike oddjob kato and more this is about the only part i laughed at br br the other is at the end where penny is checking out here gadget watch and tells brain to say somethin don adams voices the dog saying that brain isn't in right now please leave your name at the sound of the woof woof of course this isn't laugh out loud funny just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear adams in the movie he should have at least voiced the stupid car br br kids will like this anyone over 13 won't br br
<START> when i was a kid we always used to be babysat and we always used to rent a film or see a film at the cinema this is one of the films we watched this is one of the stupidest films i've ever seen i think it might even be a walt disney pictures film a martian is dropped on earth turns into a human befriends a human and is trying everything he can to get back home but he is distracted by the wonders of the earth the only good comment i can give is the choice of actors back to the future's christopher lloyd as the martian uncle martin dumb and dumber's jeff daniels as tim o'hara elizabeth hurley as brace channing and daryl hannah as lizzie but apart from that it's complete crap poor
<START> this reminds me of when i was a born again believer who was going to be a minister i never actually thought i would be a minister or even graduate from high school because i was almost positive i would be raptured to heaven before that would ever happen that was before i discovered that christianity was a bunch rubbish i am now an atheist and that just proves that the once saved always saved doctorine that christians tell us is no more real than elves if it were true then why did i leave after many years of being a devout born again believer yes i really was saved i prayed that silly sinners prayer with all my heart br br if christians were to read their bible they would discover that their god thinks like rape genocide abortion and many other atrocities are alright according to him they might be surprised to learn that no where is the word rapture mentioned
<START> first and foremost zorie barber zeke might be one of the worst actors i have ever seen as a character that's supposed to be a hip village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious why is he so hyper over dramatic and plain horrible did he know anything about his character before they started filming did the director don't the martial arts teach discipline aside from that this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seen it already gross out humor hand in toilet i trainspotting i masturbation hmm i fast times at ridgemont high i i american pie i the list goes on bad dialogue in one sequence eric says it's none of my business i but i and 30 seconds later mia says why is this any of your business bad editing at least five minutes worth of film are wasted on nyc traffic shots hr it's also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tight knit group of friends in any world i can't comment on what makes everyone laugh but if you enjoy low brow basic bathroom humor and insults by all means enjoy if you want something a little smarter but on the same lines see i boomerang i if you want a solid what goes around romantic comedy go for i the tao of steve i but anyone who thinks i whipped i is witty and an accurate portrayal dating well i cannot agree at all
<START> this has the funnist jokes out of all the cheech chong flicks it's the first one i saw with these guys i found it to be really good my dad actually recommended me to get it what a great role model and my grandma actually bought it for me knowing what it was like what a family i have well this movie is pretty good and great to rent when you want to see a good classic i must warn you though this isn't gut busting funny it has its moments but not as funny as there's something about mary check it out anyway i'm sure you'll laugh unless your an anti drug activist or something
<START> the name frau of the main character is the german word for woman i don't know if that was intentional or not but if sure got some giggles from the german audience at the fantasy film festival last year when it was shown br br but those were the only giggles the movie got not that it was aiming for giggles it's a horrible movie for heaven's sake a horrible movie in more than one meaning it's a shame that a premise like that was wasted with horrible even unbearable moments for the viewer definetely not for the faint of heart and it wasn't even necessary to show all the things that are shown i'm not even going into a moral obligation because movies don't really have that kind of task or function discussion of what is shown here but this is a new low on the whole torture movement that has grown in the last few years
<START> i saw this show about 3 4 years ago it was dam funny when i first time i saw it was playing on etv estonian television and i started to like it too bad that that show is on bad time for me hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing frank sinatra and he comes on stupid ideas he got these glasses which h are brown i like it and there's fez the group pervert we all know what he does when his alone he wants to get laid badly he even had it with his boss in one episode his from india and there is michael the stupidest guy on whole group probably stupidest in town and his a cop he is so stupid that i remember follows hyde says did u called cops no michael comes in and says does anyone know how to turn off siren he is a town playboy then comes jackie who is former girlfriend of michael and then she's hyde's girlfriend then is eric who's son of grumpy war veteran and son of kitty the housewife his one big pussy but he loves donna his girlfriend with who they plan for they're marriage donna is one hot girl hmm what i forget ah hyde lives in a basement
<START> if i could give it a zero i'd change my mind and give it a 10 instead absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot doesn't make sense of what is happening just plain boring please don't waste your money on this one pleaseee this movie could have done so well if it truly depicted the real zodiac killer's story but nopes i didn't feel anything but disgust while watching it do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead its better to watch a movie you've already seen like 3 4 times than watch this crap i don't understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know its not going to do well zodiac killer should be called 'boriac killer' instead
<START> thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey john carpenter and tommy lee wallace this movie sucks on so many levels it's pathetic the first vampires was fun but this low budget retread makes me yawn br br jon bon jovi the poor man's kevin bacon drives around mexico with a surfboard housing a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear ala antonio banderas's guitar case in desperado he picks up some lame hunters along the way including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes pills to keep from turning into a vampire and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no backstory and so we could care less about her or her quest to walk in the sunlight by stealing the black cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so if you've seen the first vampires you've already seen this and done much better br br john carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately frankly i think he's past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic the only decent film he's done since they live 1987 is vampires everything else is complete crap right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded ghosts of mars and now this waste of celluloid where are more greats like assault on precinct 13 halloween 1 escape from new york and the thing br br carpenter crony wallace proves he can't write his way out of a paper bag with his paper thin script packed with yawns groans and recycled gags from the original did i mention i hated every character in the movie there was not a single memorable character in the whole film how does that happen this film has nothing to recommend it not even the dvd presentation is good the menu looks awful br br by comparison jason x friday the 13th in space was a masterpiece now that is how you make a sequel and re energize a franchise ladies and germs as well as create an exciting dvd menu
<START> sadly i don't remember the book anymore but i do recall that i was captivated by the stories of edgar wallace this film represents a typical german production of low quality it does not hold my attention although the story itself is good it is just badly adabted at the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated they have no nuances in their performances even the well known and liked german actors joachim fuchsberger and eddy aren't cannot rescue this poor spectacle however there's hope i've been told that the films following this one are getting better and better so in conclusion i must say that this film doesn't deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon
