<START> this film proves that the commercial cinema or else the hollywood movies are in a serious crisis there is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on shaquille's name there is no worth referring to the plot it is a bit more perplexed than a knot what else the screen is somewhat dim o'neal is a bad actor but francis capra is even worse br br rating 1 10
<START> i somehow missed this movie when it came out and have discovered it as late as last week thanks to a friend's recommendation i can honestly say that i cannot remember another intimate dramatic film which does so many things so well the writing is crisp realistic nuanced and even restrained the cinematography and editing are understated but inspired enabling the visual storytelling to dominate through marvelous close ups and framing of images capturing loneliness and alienation in most memorable ways the acting is also wonderful with all of the characters becoming painfully real and vulnerable in the most compelling ways that a film can offer they reveal their innermost weaknesses with unprotected raw vulnerability a real triumph for roger michell and hanif kureishi and the rest of the team a must see for serious film lovers
<START> keeping all political views aside feroz khan and anil kapoor's 'gandhi my father' is a good movie that cleverly explores the confused towards family side of mohandas karamchand gandhi and the fight of his eldest son harilal gandhi with the society his larger than life father and most importantly demons in his head one draws parallels to gandhi the father of the nation and struggles any son could have with their father br br the acting is good shefali shetty darshan zariwala and akshaye khanna strictly in that order add color and pathos to this heart wrenching tale of harilal who weeps to be hugged just once and also runs away at the faintest touch of the finger br br feroz khan's direction and the production canvas is lavish and attractive however the screenplay could've been tighter i had seen the play some years ago on a pirated video type dvd it was called mahatama vs gandhi i think and it was certainly more gripping though the movie's background score and the father son and mother son moments are just a brilliant treat br br this movie could have been great it's borderline to that it has the potential so huge to have been just a story differences between a father and son or just gandhi or even both somewhere the plot is lost and when you expect absolute epitome of emotions nothing comes to you br br it compares decently to other gandhi's certainly not an overview film like kingsley's gandhi or abstract as kamal hassan's hey ram the film just about manages to find its footing however one is left wondering what if worth a watch 7 5 10
<START> just saw this at the chicago film festival avoid it at all costs unless you have sleep problems it is a film filled with pretensions it opens with a minor quote from hiroshima mon amour and it's all downhill from there camera work imagine a child trying to imitate wong kar wai story line smokey robinson and the miracles' the love i saw in you was just a mirage expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours but filled with repetition for butt numbing pain this film ranks with the benches at the methodist church my parent dragged me to when i was a kid i want 2 hours of my life refunded julian hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was controversial that is true only for the film's narcotic effect
<START> when you wish for the dragon to eat every cast member you know you're in for a bad ride br br i went in with very very low expectations having read some of the other comments and was not let down unlike some other cheap and failed movies however this one doesn't really remain hilariously and unintentionally funny throughout br br spoilers follow br br first of all plot it very inconsistent looking past the small mistakes such as the dragon growing up in 3 hours the whole idea it's based on is messed up see the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites which really were dragon eggs after explaining this they show some peasant poking at one with his pitchfork and the dragon pops out later the obligatory crazy scientist guy babbles on about how dragons outlived the dinosaurs so apparently humans were around when dinosaurs were or we just have a fine little plot hole here the other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force half as strong as what was used for hiroshima then two guys later walk in to check everything out and it's almost unscathed there's even another dragon which grew out of who knows what all in all it's very predictable as soon as the guy mentioned cloning i guessed they'd clone a dragon that means that our mr smarty pants security guy isn't so intuitive and smart as the movie would have you believe if you ignore that i knew this film would be about you know dragons br br putting that aside the second worst thing is the special effects others have mentioned the fake rocks falling during the beginning the cg helicopter and the dragon it looks a bit better than a blob but it ruined whatever it had going for it when it trudged down the hall in the same manner time after time to their credit the flying dragons in the beginning looked ok from far away although the one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie these things are funny to watch however the scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not nor are the introduction screens with the vital stats br br coming to the actors they weren't the greatest but i guess at least they tried they seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent bloodrayne for example and you've got to give them points for that one thing i noticed though was that the woman who plays meredith often had her face covered in make up that was many tones lighter than the rest of her she looked like she had a bad run in with some white face br br the script is bad and cheesy you don't really notice the music but it's actually not too bad for the most part br br the bottom line is don't watch it unless you want to see it because you hear it's bad like i did although the only funny things are the bad cg effects other than that don't waste your time and money
<START> i can't understand all the hype about this movie ok if you like cheap splatter you will love this movie but if you like good stories and good actors don't watch this personally i really disliked the actors in this movie they seem to be hired straight from the street the dialogs are completely flat and you always know what's coming up next the overall quality of this movie lacks of the supposable very low budget when we saw this movie me and 3 other people we all had in mind that this movie was made by some people who needed to do this just to get their graduation at a film school with the lowest effort another issue that really lessens the whole experience is the bad cam very shaking and the bad sound the whole movie seems to be recored with a single microphone
<START> i saw the trailer for this movie in the 70's when i was barely 16 while viewing another film oh how excited me and my best friend were we couldn't wait for the month or so until it would come on i saw this movie 17 times that year at the theatre i love love love it kris is so perfect for the film he is brash and kinda trashy but also shy and uncertain with babs and it is so endearing to watch it again when they sing evergreen at the studio and he chimes in with his raspy voice so very different from the perfect notes coming from her but i always thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie the way he looks at her and he is so proud i could watch this movie every day we tried to dress like est her i even have the long sweater and cap that was so like the one she wore this came on tv on time and i got my daughters to watch it they were teens and they loved it to maybe its just that i was so caught up into it at an age when everything was extreme don't know the ending always has me in tears even today
<START> the synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect it's a very good thriller well shot tough to believe it was bill paxton's directorial debut though some shots do look exactly like a storyboard version br br still there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of paxton br br it's a solid story with some great twists at the end several of them all believable all fun and best of all obscured well enough to make them true twists br br the child actors in the movie do a great too i'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as nickelodeon rejects but both these kids do a good job br br this movie is not gory it's not very scary but it is very very creepy
<START> i must say this movie is truly amazing and heartwarming reese witherspoon is so charming and jason london's not so bad either it is so sweet watching dani fall in love and it breaks my heart and yet warms my heart at the same time watching court fall in love with maureen however it is even sweeter watching how much he cares for dani i must admit though i did kind of want him to fall for dani in the end it is just so cute watching her fall for him i did not want her to get her heart broken so badly but the biggest tragedy i have ever seen occurred in this movie watching him die made me cry for a whole day i just could not believe it however never a more loving relationship has been shown in a movie then maureen and dani they really can make it through anything i am giving this movie a 9 because i didn't want court to die but it was still one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen
<START> this show is dull lame and basically rips off all sorts of various things in order to make it original first off the animation is so ugly johnny's hideous and everyone's annoying the twins look like teen female dexters from dexter's lab and johnny is almost like a more intelligent male dee dee also from dexter's lab secondly the plots are painfully lame making them hard to follow the gags are corny and nothing really makes me feel compelled to laugh a little bit especially when it tries to be funny i only saw two episodes but those alone turned me off br br third off the whole theme song starts off by ripping off the tune to green day's american idiot and while i am not a big fan of that band i find it really dumb that they would take the same opening melody and then subtly change it in order to make it their own br br case in point it's a big fat ugly bore 1 10
<START> you want to see the movie the gamers by dead gentlemen productions this is not that movie this movie is not funny it is a waste of time br br all of the good comments here seem to be written by poorly disguised false third parties the people who made this movie seem to be attempting to synthesize fake interest br br this movie is not a well done mockumentary comparisons to spinal tap or christopher guest are insulting br br the movie is so mean spirited that i cannot imagine anyone familiar with the subject matter finding it funny being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality but if you are the ones being lampooned in this manner you'd have to hate yourself to enjoy it br br the movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo topics but because of its constant pathetic banality
<START> i watched this movie once and might watch it again but although jamie foxx is good in the movie i feel they could have used a 'less funny' character as alvin sanders foxx's scenes for instance in the jail when he is confronted by edgar clenteen david morse are too funny david morse again is a wonderful portrayer of a cop his tough yet mostly quiet features are perfect for his role once again morse meets doug hutchinson bristol in the theater morse ends up coming down hard on hutchinson they are both perfect for this scenario in each film i personally love that quality in a film where actors end up in the same situation as a previous film as these two did in the green mile overall it was a pretty good movie
<START> this movie gets both a 6 10 rating from me as well as a 9 10 here is why as a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd where action and gore and scares are taken into consideration this movie will bore you it's basically a family drama similar to what you'd see on the lifetime channel but put in a horror universe the story and formula are age old retreaded hundreds of times if you're looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflicts you'll be disappointed take away the zombies and you'll have something just as melodramatic as a beautiful mind tripping on cheese this is the 6 10 br br however the basic synopsis and idea is pretty original and over the top it's literally something you and your friends would joke about when you're half drunk but that joke actually got a theatrical release the idea gets a 9 10 from me the only reason it isn't perfect is because they could have taken it even further but they didn't br br the mix of both is mixed i thought it was funny but as with most all comedies it wasn't that funny i had my mom and little sister watch it with me and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the jokes scripted there were moments of utter genius but there were also moments of pure boredom br br i sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of over the top risk and original ideas i just can't say it was perfect or even near it because of the lack of originality to the plot br br a great family movie a great movie to watch with a bunch of guys or girls a great movie to watch with anyone but if you watch it alone it will be a bit boring other people always make this kind of movie funnier and richer br br 4 10
<START> ok so it's an adult movie but it really is very tastefully done it's obvious that the producers spent a lot of time and money into making a classy sort of movie i was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was even the acting was fairly decent the plot was more solid than most adult films i've seen the camera work was above average it's just a good flick
<START> frank sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns he was a great actor from here to eternity and the man with the golden arm are a proof of that but he did not have the physique of a western hero you identified him as an urban guy but he tried to do his job well in johnny concho the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault i blame it on two factors a the story was too unusual specially in the fact that sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie in a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern to break away from it the film has to be very good b the story is not convincing it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible why all the gunfighters have not adopted it i think that this film should not have been withdrawn because any film with sinatra is worth seeing and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable
<START> well eyeboy i must say that it pleases me to no end when someone singles me out and tries to make fun of me especially when it is someone who seems as intelligent as you do my favorite part of your post was but no big bang bang good guy bad guy here kimosabe me suggest you stick to movie with lotsa bang bang br br well said i do like action movies especially if they are well done but i also like movies that don't have a whole lot of action as long as they are well done i'm sorry but secret's and lies does not fit into that category and is simply a very bad movie i really don't see very many non american films so maybe i was spoiled and didn't realize how bad foreign films really were when i saw secrets and lies perhaps if i judge foreign movies by a different standard i could some day see how secrets and lies could possibly be one of the highest rated movies on the imdb hmm if true that is very scary br br jeremy barger bits midohio net new e mail
<START> someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date i have since discredited everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie it's just terrible without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes take my word for it the sex scenes are uninteresting at best jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film she does look good but it's all downhill from there
<START> i'm a huge classic film buff but am just getting in to silent movies a lot of silent films don't hold my attention but show people is a notable exception br br marion davies and william haines are simply wonderful in this picture davies in particular shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriously br br show people is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era the movie captured my attention immediately and i actually forgot that it was a silent film i know that doesn't make much sense but that's what happened the actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessary br br show people is a perfect introduction to silent films it is a fast paced interesting film with two of the silent era's best stars add in the satire of hollywood and show people should be on the 'must see' list for all classic film buffs
<START> richard brooks' the last hunt was a film star stewart granger couldn't even stand to hear mentioned Â he even tore up a vintage poster for the film when presented it for signing in his later years Â but then the director did run off with his wife so it's understandable for anyone else this is one of the best of the adult westerns of the 50s and years ahead of its time in its attitude to the environment br br in many ways it plays almost like a sequel to one of anthony mann's westerns that see their heroes dragged to their redemption kicking and screaming against it every step in the way here granger's legendary buffalo hunter has already seen the light but after a buffalo stampede costs him his herd of cattle in a fit of poetic justice he's dragged back into the darkness by robert taylor's callous and proudly racist gunslinger justifying it on the grounds that i've already got the guilty conscience i might as well have the money as well raised by indians he's fully aware of the damage he's doing as the disappearing buffalo heads for extinction and he gradually becomes almost as consumed with self loathing as taylor is with hate when the two men fall out over debra paget's squaw Â the sole survivor of a band of indians taylor kills Â and a white buffalo hide that's priceless to the hunters and the indians for very different reasons a showdown becomes inevitable though the outcome certainly isn't br br taylor's is certainly ironic casting Â it was granger turning down many of the epic roles mgm developed for him in films like quo vadis and ivanhoe that gave taylor his 50s comeback after years of steady decline his hair color may not convince but his performance does a shallow and violent man so consumed with hate that he doesn't wear a gun the gun wears him granger's accent isn't always convincing but he makes a good quiet hero in the jimmy stewart mold trying to keep hold of his newfound decency and reconcile his actions with his beliefs before finally getting a chance to make amends russ tamblyn's halfbreed skinner and lloyd nolan's one legged old timer also give as good as they get but the real star is the script tightly plotted with an excellent eye and ear for character Â not to mention an ending stanley kubrick borrowed for the shining Â it balances historical revisionism with entertaining drama without ever selling either short the new french dvd is extras free but does boast a 2 35 1 transfer with an english soundtrack
<START> something i really love about this woman's short films was the elusiveness of theme especially in living with happiness this film has some nice beginnings unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue patchy performances and very television coverage br br it's once again charming television and very ordinary cinema the ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial but the sentiment is good so we can't complain too much br br i really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who doesn't demand so much boring clarity
