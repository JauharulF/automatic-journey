<START> having read diamond's book i was slightly disappointed in the series but all in all it is quite informative reading the other comments it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work seeing 'attacks' on 'western civilization' under every rug br br is diamond a little preachy sure like a lot of academics he sees his theory as the most important thing ever he uses the phrase 'guns germs and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series we get it after about the first 10 minutes br br is diamond a little simplistic in the series sure the part about the spaniards in south america is particularly amusing condensing some very long complicated history down to 'smallpox swords and horses' wrapping up the whole conquest of south america in about 15 minutes but the point remains valid these things did in fact contribute but not totally define the reasons for the spaniard's success against the established cultures br br is he preaching against western civilization in any way nope not a word not to my ear all he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly not that luck is the only reason br br in the end if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority then this series is not for you but if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence
<START> sorry not good br br it starts out interesting but looses its way a few minutes into the movie br br it does not help a lot that none of the normally great actors quaid glover ermey leto etc delivers a really good performance br br it might be owed to the fact that i saw a dubbed version german but dennis quaid's character was especially wooden and annoying and danny glover does not really make for a believable villain moreover jared leto's character does not really contribute to the story whatsoever except saving one main character's life at one point but that scene is as necessary as a windshield wiper on a submarine in the first place br br speaking of unnecessary scenes the main complaint is really the tangled and clichÃ© ridden storyline the detective of course has to settle a personal matter with the villain and is of course suspended from his official duties courtesy of his personal entanglement the killer of course wants to be tracked down and plays a cat and mouse game with his opponent for years i don't know how many movies build on a similar plot most of them better however br br the plot has got holes galore and many completely unbelievable and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to or work well with the storyline at all e g the truck stop scene or the car at the cliff's edge etc br br to top it off the ending tries to be original and exciting but fails completely in these regards we've seen much better finales with a similar kind of ultimate battle on a train in a forlorn winter landscape setup in the end there is the supposedly moving reunion of parent and child hokey at the least
<START> looking through the other comments i'm amazed that there aren't any warnings to potential viewers of what they have to look forward to when renting this garbage first off i rented this thing with the understanding that it was a competently rendered indiana jones knock off what i got was one of the most offensive movies i can remember trying to sit through made all the more shocking by the movie's comparatively high production values br br i don't think this is a spoiler but if it is be warned br br if your idea of entertainment is watching bimbo getting raped from behind by fearsome tribal chief while she is staring into the dead eyes of her significant other's severed head by all means rent this flick if not i'd advise you to look elsewhere for entertainment br br come to think of it that scene so succinctly sums up the movie that there's nothing else i really need to say about it
<START> this movie is one of those i regret having invested 90 minutes of my life that i'll never get back in the premise is really interesting essentially it's a zombie flick from the perspective of the undead let's not split hairs as to whether they're actually dead or not unfortunately they fail to deliver a compelling story within this framework the nearly unbearable monotony of the lives of the central characters may add to the realism of the film but it sucks all the entertainment value right out of it if they had put a little more effort toward keeping the viewer engaged it would have been much more likely that they drive home the social commentary
<START> distortion is a movie that sort of caught me by surprise a sort of multi layered drama that focuses on a man writing a play about his life experiences that are happening to him right at this moment to be more concise he feels that his wife is cheating on him so he hires a private eye to snoop on him his wife has no idea that this is happening meanwhile the actors in this play are also having a few whoopdedoodles up their sleeves by fooling around with each other and with shall we say unscrupulous people in the world of israel the whole thing culminates in a theater with all the actors present and the predictable but not really happens br br the director of the piece really keeps things moving along with the ensemble cast of characters and edits in a way that makes you pay attention this is a fun film actually one which i didn't mind viewing and would recommend people check out
<START> i saw this series when i was a kid and loved the detail it went into and never forgot it i finally purchased the dvd collection and its just how i remembered this is just how a doco should be unbiased and factual the film footage is unbelievable and the interviews are fantastic the only other series that i have found equal to this is 'die deutschen panzer' br br i only wish hollywood would sit down and watch this series then they might make some great war movies br br note band of brothers saving private ryan letters from iwo jima flags of our fathers and when trumpets fade are some i'd recommend
<START> i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotional especially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower moving was not as episodic and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie br br it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole i have heard many strange reasons such as a because yoda died b because bobba fett died c because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader was revealed br br i would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who cares if bobba fett died if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die don't get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett's name judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think secondly many fans did not like yoda dying sure it was a momentous period in the movie i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic all the good guys can't stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda's death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why was obi wan's death okay but yoda's not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible that is utterly ridiculous i can not believe this one first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage they had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest the only thing they had was their blasters to add it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view and not only that the heroes of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters the troopers must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strikes back the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers don't believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando's base or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at somehow they missed as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star br br the last reason that i care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like darth vader being revealed well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father annakin skywalker it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete by annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was annakin skywalker by removing the helmet the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about in fact that's is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke's father isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet br br on another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original but i can not know for sure let's see that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was br br i am not sure who criticizes these movies but i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite that it is rotj i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading br br bottom line the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day br br finally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as this movie stinks because luke is not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately br br
<START> you'd think you're in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from france to saudi arabia going through most of europe italy bulgaria croatia slovenia turkey before arriving in the middle east but this is not a tour and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights br br reda's father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the haj however since walking and taking the mule is out of the question he chooses to travel to mecca by car he can't drive and therefore enlists the help of reda to his son's protest to get him there in their broken down vehicle br br but reda doesn't see the point of having him go along when his dad could opt for the plane he resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn't understand and hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son being not the best of pals br br the beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that reda is quite a fish out of water through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differences br br it's perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with hari raya haji and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their haj the final scene in mecca is truly a sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating the sights of europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination br br it certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are don't miss this and yes book early i was pleasantly surprised that this evening's session was still a full house
<START> this is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great maybe this is because gorris' takes nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which dignifies him more than the nabokov's one br br the only thing in the movie which i don't like is the influence of valentinov's on luzhin's destiny i can't imagine nabokov creating a person like valentinov and giving him so great influence on novel's argument
<START> back when musicals weren't showcases for choreographers we had wonderful movies such as this one br br being a big fan of both wodehouse and fred astaire i was delighted to finally see this movie not quite a blend of wodehouse and hollywood but close enough some of the american vaudeville humour the slapstick not the witty banter clash with wodehouse's british sense of humour but on the whole the american style banter makes the american characters seem real rather than cardboard caricatures br br some inventive staging for the dance numbers including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors more than make up for the lack of a busby berkley over the top dance number they seem a lot more realistic if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic br br the lack of ginger rogers and eric blore don't hurt the movie instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge it's also nice not to have a wise cracking headstrong love interest instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest far more in keeping with wodehouses' young aristocratic females
<START> a collection of deleted scenes and alternative takes edited together and with added voice over to make it appear to take place after the events of the first pretty cool idea but deleted scenes are left on the cutting room floor for a reason and this is further proof as it's just not as funny as anchorman and really let's face it that film wasn't exactly comedy gold either so you get a 'movie' worse than one that was moderately funny in my eyes that still puts it one or two notches above kicking and screaming or bewitched chross your fingers that the wedding crashers is a return to old school form no pun intended br br my grade d
<START> oh what fun there is here br br amy heckerling has a flair for directing comedy fast times at ridgemont high look who's talking but here it looks like she told the actors to go out and have fun micheal keaton breezes through the role of johnny easily his best screen performance joe piscopo is great as the appropriately named danny vermin what a shame directors didn't pick up on this and i have even mentioned richard dimitri playing moronie and the character's unique vocabulary i don't think it's an accident that the bulk of the character's name is spelled moron br br good lines are sprinkled throughout the movie with peter boyle griffit dunne maurren stapleton merilu henner given good lines even actors with minor roles like dick butkus and alan hale get in a good lines br br recommend it to a friend
<START> wonderful movie with good story great humour some great one liners and a soundtrack to die for br br i've seen it 3 times so far br br the american audiences are going to love it
<START> i've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time mystery men takes its place among the classic comic strip spoofs on tv like batman and captain nice and cartoons like underdog and super chicken the same spirit lives in all of them the comic tongue in cheek tone the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous the not so sure footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries it's the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary and it's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright here br br mystery men opens on a party at a nursing home i wish kinka usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene as it is it looks like something george romero might have devised we need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else or it feels patronizing by the time the red eyes crash the festivities you half expect tom waits who plays a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout just what this party needs a little excitement if writer neil cuthbert had any sense he would have had waits mixing it up with the intruders and egging on the partiers to do the same it would have made for a rousing beginning and a better introduction of the troublesome trio the shoveler william macy the blue raja hank azaria and mr furious ben stiller who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day br br there are many other problems to mystery men than i care to go into among them that the villain casanova frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie and he doesn't geoffrey rush is the wrong actor for the part he needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a galvanic one and rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre you hope for the ripe theatrics of a john lithgow in the adventures of buckaroo banzai or the dry debonair diffidence of a paul freeman in raiders of the lost ark instead what we get is pastiche something half baked and not fully realized br br there are too many ideas running through mystery men for anyone to tie them neatly together and that may be its deepest problem but whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess i love ben stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles he takes this one is no exception but he goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that he'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by jerry stiller and anne meara his roy is related to all the put upon overly sensitive chronically defensive types that woody allen made popular and whether it's wheedling his way into the affections of the waitress at his favorite hangout the sleek claire forslani or questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero wes studi as the sphinx or giving a new member of their elite group jeaneane garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen a hard time he makes it always fun to watch i couldn't exactly say that about him in there's something about mary br br jeaneane garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of one true thing not renee zellweger i don't think i have ever seen funnier exchanges between a daughter and father okay so he's dead and his skull is in a bowling ball so sue me in the movies and the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of emily watson's spellbinding talks with god in breaking the waves and in this version the girl doesn't die and bells don't ring in your head br br william h macy does something very difficult he makes stolid magnetic you understand right away what's attracted jenifer lewis' lucille to eddie you can also understand her exasperation the barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge but when eddie's adorable half breed son looks up at his father and says i believe in you daddy to which lucille sighs and exclaims roland don't encourage your father you feel like standing and hailing neil cuthbert as a first rate wit br br with hank azaria whose only moment of note in film up to this point was his bare behind in the birdcage and louise lasser has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in bananas and mary hartman mary hartman as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware greg kinnear as captain amazing and ricky jay as his publicist kel mitchell as invisible boy paul reubens as the spleen and lena olin who if she didn't have the few lines in this movie that she has would seem to be visiting the set
<START> in my knowledge largo winch was a famous belgium comics never read telling the adventures of a playboy a sort of james bond without the spy life so when i had to choose a movie for a 5 years old kid i picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of james bond br br but just after the opening credits i got heavy doubts when american movies offer amazing start here no action and a torrid sex scene Â then the story get very complicated with financial movesÂ i thought i lost the kid br br but strangely he had been caught by largo and more than james bond br br was it the excellent interpretation of tomer sisley the difficult relationship largo has with his father the multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys the bad guys are the friends the exotic locations of honk kong yougoslavia br br dunno but he really cares about largo will he get up and we enjoyed our moment
<START> this film has its good points hot chicks people die br br the problem the hot chicks barley get nude and you don't get to see many of the people dieing mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes br br also for those of you watching this for jenna jameson she is just a side chearator with a very small role and minor nude scenes br br what this film needed script and story would be nice but i will not complain about that simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face it that is why we watch these flicks br br i wouldn't waste my money on it and if you must wait until it's on the old shelves at your local video store
<START> the 1986 tv movie of the spirit was a pilot for a possible series however spirit creator will eisner did not like the film and thus no series was produced i thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit sorry of the comic with a modern twist i'm sorry it didn't materialize into a series sam flash gordon jones was a perfect spirit nana visitor was a nice ellen dolan and of course would later go on to star trek deep space nine years later maybe with the release of frank miller's big screen version of the spirit more people will be able to see this rare gem of spirit history it seems that when hollywood makes a film from an already established character or idea someone will inevitably seek out previous versions of the property and release it to video in order to make a few dollars when antonio banderas donned the mask of zorro we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on dvd such as the great alain delon version of the 1970s although all copies i ever saw were badly edited heres hoping someone will release the tv adventure of the spirit to dvd soon
<START> i purchased this movie at a car boot sale so i was not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level as a nightmare on elm street 1984 or the hills have eyes 1977 but i thought that it would still be fairly enjoyable to watch however it proved to be not at all enjoyable but instead the acting and the general movie was mock able such as the ways the the 'unsees killer' murders his victims and how all of the people killed just happen to be young blonde women it was a stereotypical horror film i say this because of the following reasons br br 1 three blonde women in danger the majority get killed 2 one survives by crawling around in the dark while being chased by the killer 3 surprise surprise help arrives in the form of a shotgun br br by using three simple points i have saved you two odd hours by summarising this poor excuse of a horror movie so you are now lucky enough to not have to watch it
<START> i saw this film again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about cary's leslie howard childhood considering that br br at the time not much can be shown on the screen not that there is much in the novel the obsession of the character with mildred bette davis is very well conveyed to the audience i recommend this film to anyone who ever fell for another person and the other side tried to take advantage of him or her i have read that maugham was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale but when he started to in the studio he began crying and could not finish more than a few lines and whole project was chucked one can tell the novel is written from the heart and the film is a good br br adaptation of a part of it at least
<START> woody allen made september proving that even a genius could screw up this is mel brook's september monumentally stupid boring and unfunny i must confess i did not watch it through to the end the flick ranks among the dishonored few e g the money pit out to sea spitfire grill which either put me to sleep or forced me to reach for the rewind button and i say this sadly as a devoted mel brooks fan he should stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone how the same fellow that made young frankenstein and spaceballs could crank out a dog like this is beyond me to be avoided at all costs
