<START> in my mind this remains one of the very best depictions of superman on tv as well as one of the most faithful to a particular comics period br br this series paid homage to both the superman films of the '70s '80s and the superman comics series reboot of 1986 onward man of steel superman vol 2 action comics adventures of superman etc the opening score and titles were stirring based on the john williams score from the films updated for a saturday morning action series marv wolfman one of the main contributors to the comics reboot writer of adventures of superman was a perfect choice to be involved in this animated series overall the series had a more mature feel while continuing to be very kid friendly br br superman was presented as believable strong and iconic his recurring nemesis was lex luthor in his megalomaniac ceo incarnation the daily planet characters lois jimmy and perry were portrayed well one of my favorite appearances was by wonder woman and the story revolved around her home island of themyscira paradise island both her design and that of her mother hippolyte were in keeping with the similarly rebooted wonder woman comic book series of the era and it seemed like an equally well done animated series could have been developed for her if handled the same br br the one thing that is hard to believe is that this has not been released on dvd blu ray it deserves to be
<START> there should be a sub genre in the western called 'the robert mitchum western' mitchum's brilliant idiosyncratic usually undervalued westerns import his film noir persona to etch some compellingly dark character sketches and bring an elegiac world weariness more familiar from the films of sam peckinpah 'man with the gun' is one of his best directed by orson welles protege richard wilson it is a stark monochrome beauty full of chilling silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of savage violence as mitchum comes to tame a town terrorised by a monopolist with a private army mitchum's regression from soft spoken stranger to deranged murderer with a host of dark emotions in between is a marvel of expressive physical acting
<START> it's sad to view this film now that we know how the anc got shafted by international capitalism biko died for nothing much woods achieved little yes outright apartheid was abolished but all the apparatus of power was reserved by the minority whites leaving the anc government more or less impotent as naomi klein writes in the shock doctrine in the talks between the black and white leaderships the deklerk government had a twofold strategy first drawing on the ascendant washington consensus that there was no only one way to run an economy it portrayed key sectors of economic decision making such as trade policy and the central bank as technical or adminsitrative then it used a wide range of new policy tools international trade agreements innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs to hand control of those power centres to supposedly impartial experts economists and officials from the imf the world bank the gatt and the national party anyone except the liberation fighters from the anc the statistical results are horrifying with not much change accomplished and aids flourishing viewing cry freedom in this light is deeply ironic actually tragic the anc has transformed itself from being the solution to being the primary problem
<START> i think it was ebert who gave stella four out of four stars but other than his i have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions love and sacrifice three themes most great romantic stories or films have in common br br here the major theme is class division stella is a story from depression era america that said it was translated to the screen then in such a memorable fashion that this remake if you ask a stanwyck fan or two was not exactly appreciated fans of the original never gave it a chance furthermore this version of stella was made in the 1990s not exactly a time of great financial trouble in america as the depression was br br now is the time to remove the rosy coloured glasses in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in america and see that this powerful story still rings true is as timely and relevant as ever in its updated format br br yes class divide is the major theme here stella is among the working poor single with big dreams but little hope of realizing those dreams she works in a bar doesn't have much money lives in a crummy apartment you get the drift in the morning she doesn't really want to get out of bed on her wall pictures of movie stars she idolizes br br a man sees her dance at the bar he's wealthy educated from one of those upper class families that has nothing in common with stella's his major concern is what ivy league college to attend her's is how to pay the rent how to be 'happy ' they have an affair they like each other stella ends up pregnant stella tells the guy the news his response how about an abortion she replies i just wanted a room full of balloons he supplies the balloons and the proposal but she sees his heart is not in it and has too much pride to accept she sends him packing br br her daughter is eventually torn between the two lifestyles the love she has for her mom and the advantages and happiness and love held out to her by her wealthy father stella alone and unloved and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as her someday makes the ultimate sacrifice she gives up the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure the happiness of her daughter and perhaps live vicariously and with hope knowing that at least her daughter found something to live for br br now for the movie everything is right about it beautiful score artful cinematography great set design contrast between the two lifestyles the messy apt and the decorated mansions wonderful and heartfelt performances by the whole cast with bette midler in particular oscar worthy br br this is a film which is much more significant and well made than you've been led to believe
<START> no movie with dennis hopper gary busey erika eleniak tom berenger dean stockwell marilu henner deserves a rating under 5 on here this is a poor mans version of movies like 16 blocks or the timeless midnight run except the prisoner being transported here is the very easy on the eye ms eleniak tom berenger plays another gruff maverick military type well and william mcnamara plays his rookie about to be discharged foil well the plot on the face of it is absurd because i lost count of the times eleniak should have and could have escaped but this is an entertaining feel good movie and there are good cameos from all of the above actors that keep the movie rolling this isn't really a family movie as there is some swearing and a rare nude scene with eleniak but this is a lot better than some of the other guff that came out around this time
<START> i consider myself a huge movie buff i was sick on the couch and popped in this film right from the opening to the end i watched in awe at these great actors i'd never seen say great word the filming was beautiful it was just what i needed i hope that this message is heard over any bad comments written by others the director has a heart and it beats with his actors throughout thanku for making a film like this one just wonderfully awkward beautiful kind characters who are flawed and graceful all at once just great i can't submit this without 10 lines in total so i will simply go on to say that i wish for more from this director more from all the actors in this film and more from the writer i didn't want it to end the end
<START> it's all about mitzi i loved her in this and didn't she look fantastic i love these lifetime sunday afternoon popcorn movies this is like one of those nailbiters where they always go to commercial at the most annoying times the richard character was completely creepy i've dated guys like that well not totally like that lol i wish zack hadn't have gotten killed he was a cutie and very easy on the eyes i love these stalker type stories it always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked my husband doesn't usually like these types of movies but actually sat through the entire thing with me and actually enjoyed it i can't wait to see what mitzi does next
<START> i am curious of what rifle beckett was using in the movie and also the caliber of the bullet that he was suppose to be firing if this is loosely based on carlos hathcock's sniping i am guessing that it is a 7mm round i am also curious of the rifle itself he also made a comment in the final sniper movie about the rifle that the vietnamese man let him use that belonged to his father beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made i would like to know which rifle that is also i know that this particular rifle was made around wwii or beforehand i just couldn't get a close enough look at it watching the movie to identify it br br as for mr hathcocks kills his longest shot was 1 47 miles and he had 93 confirmed kills and 14 unconfirmed kills after his wounds somewhat healed from being burned in vietnam he spent the rest of his career teaching snipers in the usmc the skills that they would need in the field his sniping career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters that train in the usmc i found out his name from my friend who is a former marine any information would be great
<START> this film is definitely an odd love story though this film may not be much to shout about nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of hertfordshire life with shots of st albans hemel hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area what starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular british tv series heartbeat soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flick nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends up as fairly decent weekend entertainment a good one to watch and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character
<START> this movie was definitely not one of mary kate and ashley's best movies i really didn't like it and i was kind of disappointed in that movie for some reason it seemed like it was a movie that they put together really fast in some parts it got so boring that i had to fast forward it it didn't have any bloopers or any exciting parts like their other movies
<START> this movie was 100 boring i swear i almost died from boredom at the theater it wasnt funny and didnt really hve that much action in it either it was boring and i hope whoever out there that liked this movie god be with you in the future when you find out what this movie was really like and try to jump off a bridge or something like that
<START> it's easy to make really general comments about a film like this the fact that it's one of the only remaining japanese films from this era causes people to say that it started japanese cinema and was unlike anything the west ever made the latter of these two comments is particularly false as kinugasa himself admitted to ripping off caligari on more than one occasion but style was meant to be imitated and doesn't take away from this film's importance what we have here is experimental themes and composition built on already established visual styles opening the doors for a truly brilliant layering of narratives and realities for this purpose the madhouse is the ideal setting and the writers knew this this is a landmark film and every effort should be made to track it down br br 5 out of 5 essential
<START> gandhi my father is a well made movie it nicely portrays the life of gandhiji's eldest son harilal his character his differences with his father his love for his family his desire to stand on his own his failure his ego akshaye khanna completely justifies the role of harilal just not him everyone did well in the roles they played darshan jariwala is the best on screen gandhiji i've ever seen but i will cut three points as there were few shortcomings br br first movie was fifteen twenty minutes longer than it should have second the movie needed more research into harilal's character somewhere the character looked incomplete also his relation with his brothers was not shown there was no mention of any other child of gandhiji in the whole movie i believe the character like harilal should be having at least some differences his brothers as well considering the egoist nature of harilal br br anyways despite some shortcomings i liked the movie recommended
<START> only the most ardent doris day fan could find this one even bearable to watch when one thinks of the wealth of material available for a story about new york city's most famous blackout a film that could have dealt with numerous real life stories of what people had to cope with this scrapes the bottom of the barrel for lack of story telling originality br br once again doris is indignant because she suspects she may have been compromised on the night of the blackout when she returned to her connecticut lodgings took a sleeping potion and woke up in the morning with a man who had done the same wandering into the house by mistake br br nobody is able to salvage this mess not doris not robert morse terry thomas patrick o'neal or lola albright as directed by hy averback it's the weakest vehicle day found herself in committed to do the film because of her husband's machinations and unable to get out of it too bad
<START> what starts out as a gentle country yarn inoffensive and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as edward norton's initially charming harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the sinister as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern wild western br br an amiable rancher norton wanders into town and charms a young girl evan rachel wood seemingly rescuing her from a dead end existence with her bad tempered father with a whirlwind romance but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye br br edward norton Â a real chameleon actor with changing facial hair to match playing a country hick accent slightly dodgy but maybe because he's merely trying to act the part without worrying about the accent he certainly makes it appear effortless to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about harlan however with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where harlan is coming from and what seemed like a good performance from norton gradually becomes confused evan rachel wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her eyelids at norton br br down in the valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace and by never really making the protagonist's motives clear the audience's sympathies for the characters remain uncertain should we like this drifter or not even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear this ambiguity is to the film's detriment as if the writer could not make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a hotch potch had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess fans of old fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the film but will be put off by the darkening tone completist fans of norton aside or fans of the lush scenery of the san fernando valley give this a miss
<START> i found 'still crazy' to be marvelously entertaining and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late '60s early '70s rock my 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time i drag out the dvd don't worry it's only been three times and she loves it too br br it is a truly loving poignant and hilarious nod to the era and every actor hits his her notes with perfection it was my first introduction to bill nighy and i am glad his somewhat similar turn in 'love actually' brought him more attention bruce robinson was incredible as brian bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug damaged rocker stereotype it was interesting to see that robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer br br i live in sherman oaks california and after the first time i saw the movie i bumped into billy connolly at the local mall he lived here at the time and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time he invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time we even talked of the idea of an american oriented remake before wisely dismissing that why mess with the original br br my only problem with 'still crazy' is that it wasn't hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience
<START> this film is so much of a rip off of the masterpeice demons and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching the acting is terrible the action scenes are speeded up the script is almost painful and budget non existent br br if you think this film is good then you havn't seen a real horror film skip this and get a copy of the movie demons
<START> despite gorgeous and breathtaking animation this is probably one of most uninspiring disney films i've seen and i don't slam disney films very often spirit is a wild stallion who repeatedly gets captured either by the cavalry or by indians both of which try to break him spirit ends up forming a bond with the indian and that in a nutshell is the story with exception to the beautiful animation of the horses neither i or my five year old were very inspired or excited by this film it's ironic that it's titled spirit as spirit is what this film could have used a bit more of an extra point was given for the soundtrack which was enjoyable with songs by bryan adams and hans zimmer and although this film is rated g you will still probably have to end up explaining what breaking a horse means to your five year old i did br br
<START> of all the reviews i've read most people have been exceedingly hard on alexandre neither marie or veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep alexandre he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual as most of us are however hard it may be for anyone to admit alexandre is getting away with life perfectly being totally taken care of getting and giving what he wants the girls are allowing this veronika loves sex marie is his patron is there anything wrong with any of this is anyone in love really i don't think so though french new wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in alexandre's position in an urban area can ask for i'm looking for a patron anyone interested
<START> a comparison between this movie and 'the last detail' is made by some but 'chasers' is flatter than a stretch of interstate highway in west texas and like the scenery in the desert there's nothing much to distinguish it not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around no one in the cast comes off too well with this lame script that's not surprising dennis hopper the director won't give much space to this one if he ever writes a memoir i don't think
