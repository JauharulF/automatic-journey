<START> if you want to watch a real 'quality' movie get hold of the eden formula this wondrous film must have cost all of 50 to make it features a wafer thin script pathetically bad sets lighting and camera work and a stop motion paper mache monster that is utterly laughable it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and or a glove puppet for the monster but all were equally dreadful br br the actors all speak their lines as though they've never seen them before and are reading off a teleprompter the special effects are way beyond lousy and the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title 'tyranasaurus wrecks' which sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes br br this is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the crud that lies underneath br br i loved every minute of it
<START> well my goodness am i disappointed when i first heard news of a remake of robert wise's 1963 film the haunting i had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summer movie sized visual effects but deep down i had faith surely with such a talented cast intact de bont and company will not ruin a film who's original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety well subtlety where are you now my fears have manifested a promising movie has gone wrong yes eugenio zannetti's production design is jaw dropping the movie is wonderfully photographed and composer jerry goldsmith can never ever do wrong but the script puts it's fine actors to the test asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies in the end the always wonderful lili taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity and that's just barely but the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us we can no longer use our imaginations feel that horrible dread of fear of the unknown no we get some visual effects to show us what we're supposed to be afraid of and you know what as wonderfully realized as they are the visual effects come off as sort of silly and the climax is a phantasmogoric mess but things had gone terribly wrong long before that br br everything in the haunting is overdone and overblown i'm afraid there are no real thrills or creaks in this old haunted house monstrosity only groans check out the original instead br br
<START> hmmÂ i agree with the reviewer who said that strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film i thought the film was intriguing enough to watch it i think that was primarily because of marsden and speedman not the plot br br the bottom line is that this film is mildly psychologically tantalizing on the one hand and profoundly homophobic on the other thumbs up on the former and triple thumbs down on the latter i'm not sure if the film is intended to promote dialogue or to spread fear and propaganda br br i thought the acting was mediocre a lot of conversation that was about 90 degrees askew of reality i kept wanting to derive some meaning from the plot but it's ultimately just a conversation with a mad man speedman i feel mildly sorry for him speedman because of his loss but not really his loss is no greater and certainly is less than losses suffered every day around the world by more significant causes br br does the film expose naivetÃ© about hiv aids yes that of the intended audience is hiv a dark mysterious evil killer what about it's victims the answer to both questions is no neither hiv nor its victims have any more or less malevolent intent than lupus multiple sclerosis tb hepatitis cancer or their victims for god's sake just because a disease is communicable does not make it either deliberate or negligent or evil it just is br br does this excuse ignorance or fool hardy risk taking no should all people practice safe sex yes will safe sex save the world no is safe sex realistic in all instances of love and lust between passionate and emotional human beings Â of course not what kind of a world would we live in if everyone followed the rules no one ever took risks and sex was never spontaneous and passionate am i ignoring that the film deals specifically with gay sex Â yes hiv is spread by sharing blood or bodily fluids between infected and non infected individuals sex is not necessary for transmission gay or otherwise br br i'm always disturbed by willful violence of one person upon another i actually thought the film did do a good job of portraying the absurdity of tom's violent abduction captivity and intent towards dan and this kind of insane violence does occur every day br br stream of consciousness notes from the film tom is crazy br br why doesn't dan ask why do you feel this way rather than what are you doing implication men who have sex with men get aids implication hiv aids where was tom's responsibility in the sex act why was it dan's responsibility to use the condom maybe you slipped it off before you stuck it inÂ what are we talking about here was one of the parties unconscious maybe she didn't want to hear the truth are you kidding me she's up in heaven and so unbelievably hurt about what she now knows about me ÂrightÂ is dan's life over if he has hiv certainly not is this why the whole world is so homophobic they think gay men are the cause of hiv that they will give it to the rest of the world and we will all dieÂ are you kidding me are people really stupid enough to think that homosexuality is the cause is the problem do we feel that way about the victims of tuberculosis of malaria i can see that tom is hurt because of his wife's death and he blames it on aids but seriouslyÂ who's at fault here the victim or the virus are illnesses really the responsibility of the ill presuming they did not seek and did not seek to spread the disease br br sure safe sex is essential to a safe life but so is not driving not flying not leaving the house not living do we really want to blame the disease on the victims would safe sex between tom and dan have prevented tom's wife's ultimate demise perhaps but not dan's sole responsibility br br tom is crazy did i mention that br br tom to dan maybe you get what you deserve Â come on 24 days violent naÃ¯ve and homophobic br br am i overreacting perhaps but i think this film points a judging finger at gay men for their reckless and malevolent intent towards a straight world by practicing unsafe sex when the rate of homosexuals practicing safe sex is proportionately equivalent or better than that of heterosexuals we all need to wake up and get serious about hiv aids hiv is killing hundreds of thousands of straight africans every year
<START> the five deadly venoms is a great kung fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery there are all the usual telltale signs of a kung fu flick great choreography awful dubbing different styles of fighting and a wide range of greatly exaggerated often cheesey human emotions however the plot certainly is better than average it's interesting and holds your attention throughout the non fight scenes occasionally it's even able to fire up the audience such as when x character receives horrible injustice br br another thing i love about the five deadly venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie's morals and themes just about everyone gets what's coming to them the cowardly greedy and corrupt lose out the bad guys consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing the good guys use teamwork planning and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top br br poison clan rocks
<START> ecstasy 1933 usa 1940 starring hedy lamarr as hedy kiesler br br the world's first glimpse of a 19 year old hedy lamarr occurs in the early moments of this 1930's treasure as she sweeps across the screen in an angelic wedding gown this was to be the start of a legendary career this was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen br br it is eva's lamarr wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic advances she retreats to the lonely bed and in a beautiful scene she fiddles with her wedding ring as the realization of her marital mistake overcomes her the husband seems more interested in neatness and order than he does in love gustav machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture lamarr's considerable talent and beauty with no words spoken in the early part of the film she is able to grasp our sympathy our hearts and our support it is that combination that prepared the 1930's audiences for what they were about to see as the film unfolded 'ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time some thought it to be scandalous br br she returns home to her father's estate and files for divorce the next day she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness she just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake and in one of the most famous scenes in film history hedy lamarr became the first person to ever appear nude in a major film her frolic in the woods and her skinny dipping adventure in the lake were legendarily scandalous but the audiences couldn't stay away as with many of today's movies the controversy made it a must see film br br eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse who had run off with her clothes after an awkward meeting they eventually fall for each other their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene with its blatant waves of eroticism however machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments machaty creates one delightful moment when eva literally seems to sink into her new lover using a gorgeous early camera trick br br it cannot be overstated how brave this performance was on lamarr's part many might have presumed it was career suicide instead it gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye louis b mayer who signed her to a contract with mgm there are some truly erotic moments in this film even by today's raunchy standards it is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930's again machaty was very clever with his imagery leaving a lot to the imagination but we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done br br the meeting of eva's former husband and her current lover is perhaps inevitable however the consequences of that meeting are not the film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and it all makes for a great story and a lovely debut on the grand stage of movie stardom for hedy lamarr br br i highly recommend this once controversial now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on dvd it is easily worthwhile if only for the pleasure of seeing hedy lamarr but the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time 'ecstasy' is a memorable early treasure br br www tccandler com tc candler's movie reviews
<START> one stinko of a movie featuring a shopworn plot and to be kind acting of less than oscar caliber but to me the single worst flaw was the total misrepresentation of a jet aircraft and especially a 747 some of the major blunders br br 1 no flight engineer or even a flight engineer station 2 mis identifying the f 16 interceptors as f 15's no resmblance whatsoever 3 loading passengers into an aft baggage compartment supposedly accesible from the cabin even if such a compartment existed placing that much weight that far aft would make the aircraft unflyable 4 hollow point bullets that won't damage the aircraft 5 the entire landing procedure was so bad i wanted to puke 6 an sr 71 of all planes with a pressure seal hatch 7 opening a cabin door outward into the wind in flight br br ah nuts it was just a truly lousy movie gotta make the list of bottom 10 of the year
<START> well i just paid a dollar for a dvd of this movie and it wasn't even worth that it seems to be from a poor print and is in the public domain i am guessing br br neagle despite her glory awards and reputation is a homely british gal who can't sing or dance or act br br some of the fine old hollywood character actors on display here must have thought they were doing a classic director herbert wilcox neagle's husband always thought anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen he was mistaken she was improbably popular in britain before and after wwii her serious roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance here br br only a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented skip this one and find the one that stars doris day at least you get some real comedy and professional style dancing
<START> this film differentiates itself from the run of the mill wonder of the human body documentaries by bravely if bizarrely opting to elicit disgust in the viewer in one scene the camera closes in on a gigantic 50 foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it in another the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo in a final tour de force the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of teenage armpit hair unfortunately i'm not making any of this up see this film if you must but bring your vomit bag and don't have pasta salad beforehand
<START> i imagine victorian literature slowly sinking into the mire of the increasingly distant past pulled down by the weight of its under skirts along comes television at its best it has a redemptive power and with dramatisations like those the bbc produce so finely victorian literature gets a new stab at life the religious themes the moral overtones may be increasingly ill at ease in a world no longer easily shocked and acquainted with cohabitation affairs and domestic violence but those old well told stories have enduring power and this is one's a hidden gem br br it's hard to gauge today just how forceful feminist and extraordinary ann bronte's masterpiece the tenant of wildfell hall actually was emerging from the primeval slime of restrictive corsets Â bodily mental societal Â her heroine helen huntingdon escapes a miserable marriage flees brutality and alcoholism braves not only her abusive husband's fury but society's pinched intolerance and malicious gossip to wreak change in her life she pays a price but retains her self respect she falls in love along the way she emerges battered but victorious and strong i just love watching women like these on screen br br the actors are superb Â the best brits have to offer the love story is beautifully handled with real passion and feeling by well matched actors tara fitzgerald inhabits every aspect of the complicated heroine and as has been said here by other reviewers no less sharply defined and beautiful a face could survive that petrifying hairstyle toby stephens striking sparks off her contributes just the right combination of headstrong handsome youth and passionate yearning vulnerability rupert graves one of my favourite british actors ever enjoys himself as the charismatic villain so much so that you're almost with him at the end no one's perfect the supporting cast ably create a world into which you sink without feeling that coarse compromises have been made to modern tastes and without having felt preached to another bbc classic highly recommended this is how romantic literature should be dramatised
<START> after i got done watching this movie i was so upset that i had wasted 2 hours of my life that's 2 hours i'll never get back ugh when you start this you might think wow this is really good but rest assured that first impressions mean nothing i was so excited about this movie until the dumbest ending i have ever seen this movie is simply pathetic the acting is bland the story line is anything but original and there's nothing especially unique about this except that it's the worst movie ever do not watch this movie warning dumbest movie ever you will be sorry if you waste 2 hours of your life on this 1 10
<START> this film was amazing it is an inspiring piece of cinema the characters are fully developed through the truth in which director lucy walker brings to the film i highly recommend this to any one looking for that special film that shows the humanity in the human condition lucy wlaker showcases the landscape beauty this film id a true example of man vs nature and sometimes man vs man the inner turmoil and triumph is tremendous in its subject matter the subject of how the tiebtans view blindness as a sign of demons is interesting this film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been showcased lucy walker has given erik weihenmayer a voice when he would have not normally been heard thank you lucy for being true to your vison as a filmmaker
<START> this is a really bad film with bad acting and a very boring pace lorenzo lamas is really cool though all the characters are just annoying except lamas and there is absolutely no one to root or to care for plus the action is very boring the film gives us 3 villains who were supposed to find menacing and disturbing when in fact there boring laughable and just a bunch of morons that i wanted to shut up plus it looks very cheap and amateurish lorenzo lamas has a lot of charisma but he can't save this piece of crap and believe it or not the opening was really cool as was the ending however the middle is incredibly boring and got me to have the urge to press the fast forward button plus the dialog is especially laughable there is a cool bar scene that i really liked but once lamas heads to the dock it all falls apart plus the scene where the villains torture jennifer's family and kills them were supposed to find it disturbing when it in fact is laughable this is a really bad film with bad acting and a very boring pace lorenzo lamas is really cool though however it is not enough not recommended the direction is very bad george erschbamer does a very bad job here with mediocre camera work bland location and keeping the film at a boring pace the acting is pretty bad except for lamas lorenzo lamas is awesome here and while he isn't required to act he is quite fun to watch and has a really cool character and had a lot of charisma however even he can't save this one and he had no chemistry with the cast either lamas rules josie bell is terrible here and while she's decent looking she isn't very convincing and had no chemistry with lamas cheryl jeans is hot but does not have much to do but scream and scared she did okay at that robert scott is incredibly annoying as the main villain and wasn't menacing at all he was laughable as were the other 2 rest of the cast are bad overall avoid avoid even if you do like lamas like me out of 5
<START> stage adaptations often have a major fault they often come out looking like a film camera was simply placed on the stage such as night mother sidney lumet's direction keeps the film alive which is especially difficult since the picture offered him no real challenge still it's nice to look at for what it is the chemistry between michael caine and christopher reeve is quite brilliant the dynamics of their relationship are surprising caine is fantastic as always and reeve gets one of his few chances to really act br br i confess that i've never seen ira levin's play but i hear that jay presson allen's adaptation is faithful the script is incredibly convoluted and keeps you guessing deathtrap is an enormously entertaining film and is recommended for nearly all fans of stage and screen br br 7 4 out of 10
<START> genghis cohn is a very mildly entertaining british movie about a german police commissioner in the late 1950's who is haunted by the ghost of a jewish comedian that he killed 15 years earlier while serving under hitler in the ss the ghost comes back and wants his killer to live as a jew to atone for the murders he committed br br otto the german policeman actually knows this ghost's name because the last thing he did before he died was said in yiddish kiss my ass' the policeman didn't speak yiddish so he asked around until he found the meaning the kiss my ass' left such an impression that everybody involved with that killing learned and remembered the comedian's name genghis cohn br br there are a bunch of men who are murdered in the jurisdiction of the police commissioner and there are no helpful clues the men are murdered with a set of knives that are missing from the local butcher the butcher announces that his knives are missing while the commissioner is in the store to get a liver and onion sandwich so the commissioner is a suspect the first man is killed while making love to the butcher's wife so the butcher is a suspect but the butcher maintains that he would be very busy if he killed every man that slept with his wife all the men are killed immediately after the climax of lovemaking br br i think i might be a bit angrier than the ghost of genghis cohn if i was killed like he was he seems to be very good natured about it as if he was just in a mild car accident i can only guess that it is because it is a british movie and they are known for being a very polite people he uses some of his material from his stand up routing and i just didn't find it very funny br br i gave this movie a 4 because it was just kind of goofy i thought it should have been a little more serious than it was the movie turns out to be a murder mystery where did this come from and it seemed that genghis should have been more helpful than he was the movie gave me a tiny look into jewish culture but was only skin deep do all jews love liver and onion sandwiches do they all say shtoop' and meshuganah' in their daily vocabulary isn't there more important stuff that we should know about the culture br br i saw this movie at a jewish community center in berkeley ca and i was the only person in the room whose hair was not fully gray or white i have no gray or white hair there were 18 of us and after the movie they stayed for about 20 minutes to discuss the movie there were 2 main concerns expressed there 1 the movie was way too light hearted and future generations might not understand the gravity of what happened and 2 as the holocaust survivors are dying off future generations will not know what really happened i thought that this second concern was ridiculous and i told them i thought they didn't need to worry because there is tons of literature out there and there will always be people who like to watch movies like myself the murder of 6 000 000 people by a very bad man will not ever be forgotten i write this last paragraph because they charged me with telling others about my experience that day
<START> this movie isn't as bad as i heard it was enjoyable funny and i love that is revolves around the holiday season it totally has me in the mood to christmas shop and listen to holiday music when this movie comes out on dvd it will take the place of christmas vacation in my collection it will be a movie to watch every year after thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year i heard that ben's character was a bit crazy but i think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time take it for what is it a christmas comedy with a love twist i enjoyed it no it isn't titanic and it won't make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two so go laugh and have a good time
<START> posh spice victoria beckham and her alleged new adventures after just moving to la for work purposes footballer hubby david is now a galaxy la player after his transfer from real madrid was originally going to be a full series but was thankfully abridged to just one hour or so but even in this form it is still numbingly interminable br br like virtually all 'reality' tv shows most of the incident comes across as blatantly faked with the programme itself even admitting that posh's newly appointed personal assistant is an actress an ugly betty lookalike we hear some lamely written and performed banter early on with an obvious joke about becks' apparent dalliance with a previous and rather more glamorous pa rebecca loos though her name is not mentioned with further sequences involving a fake blow up doll to trick the paparazzi and hopeless attempts to pitch a baseball br br this could have been more entertaining if all had acknowledged it was a piece of fluff and had an actress or impersonator in the lead role talented impressionist ronni ancona would've been perfect and is better at being posh than posh herself is and if this more sensible decision had been taken much more fun and amusement would've ensued sadly we are left with the real thing here ms ancona may have rejected the script as too weak anyway and although there are odd scattered attempts at self deprecation and irony it never remotely works because of prior info of la beckham's considerable wealth beforehand and her non ability at delivering would be jokes despite the intentions to send up her image mrs beckham comes across as a shallow egotist and her weak one liners don't persuade us she has any humorous self awareness i suspect that if a more realistic fly on the wall documentary approach had been taken namely posh walking down any street in la and being totally ignored instead of the frantic staged scenes of mild hysteria on show here and associates making unscripted jibes about the previously mentioned ms loos this would've made marginally better tv but being sycophantic pr material the bony one herself would never allow such events to happen br br having said that the later scenes where she made a special appearance at the baseball stadium where she was indifferently presented in front of an uninterested crowd show it will be tough times ahead if she wants to make it big in hollywood her colleague scary spice aka mel brown also found it impossible to make it big residing in the movie capital despite her affair which was not consummated with big name eddie murphy br br the spice girls were of course a massively successful bubblegum pop group in the mid 1990's more so in their native britain but still popular briefly in other countries including the us they were certainly good fun at their peak of glory 1997 when there seemed to be a glorious period of optimism in the uk with cool britannia and a new labour government which the spice girls seemed to sum up better then anyone else at the time even if it was somewhat manufactured but they were never outstanding musical or singing talents and uk optimism seemed to fade rapidly later that year the starting point was arguably the tragic death of princess diana as did the spices' themselves their presence on the music and entertainment scene soon became repetitive and obvious and if they had all quietly moved out of the public eye permanently with dignity to enjoy their fortunes then we would have all had pleasant memories encrypted on our mind without any guilt unfortunately the emergence of the hideous 'celebrity' culture in the uk towards the start of the millennium has put paid to those imaginings and we have all suffered thousands if not millions of stories about the spices since posh being the worst offender with the rest of her colleagues not too far behind it was recently announced that there will be a reunion tour soon which is baffling as they have never gone away and they certainly don't require any additions to their swelling bank accounts maybe it's because two of them are struggling single mothers perhaps br br good it's soon time for becks' adventures on a revelatory documentary next i can hardly wait br br rating 2 out of 10
<START> a matter of life and death what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film powell and pressburger's visual imagination knows no bounds every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions the switches between the bold colours of the real world to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is the final court scene is also fantastic as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter david niven 's operation br br all of the performances are spot on roger livesey being a standout and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful never has there been a more romantic film than this if there has i haven't seen it a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is and jack cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone the way he lights kim hunter's face makes her all the more beautiful what a genius he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting and the sound design is also impeccable the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time br br this is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in cinema under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audiences but one of my all time favourites which is why i give this film a 10 10 in a word beautiful
<START> the garden of allah is a prime example of popular women's literature turn of the xxth century style combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism and the sado masochistic bite of catholic guilt just as jane eyre couldn't really be happy until her castle burned down around her and her lover was permanently maimed for his sins or the heroine of rebecca couldn't find true fulfillment in her marriage until her lordly husband was put on trial for the murder of his first wife and her castle burned down around her or poor psyche couldn't leave well enough alone and had to extract cupid's secret at all costs domini the devout catholic heroine of this piece of tripe can only find true sexual realization by inadvertently marrying a man who has renounced his sacred religious vows like all such narratives aiming to stimulate the female reader and induce the vapours this one relies on the oldest tricks in the book basic misunderstandings and the inability to express one's true feelings at the right place and at the right time until it is too late the logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be indulged in as long as one is willing to eventually pay a high enough price for it in atonement in the last act it is paul claudel reduced to beauty salon magazine standards oh well it could have been much worse and it often was br br without the religious overtones the film's plot is that of your basic porn flick oversexed monk driven mad by abstinence escapes to the desert where he has a few rolls in the dunes with a romantic shapely but naive catholic heiress before reintegrating his monastery all passion spent leaving her to clean up his mess and i really resent another commentator's comparison with anatole france's thais a sophisticated novel whose intention was to make fun of the whole concept of catholic sexual repression some of which transpired in massenet's opera of the same name thankfully br br but what makes this picture unique in the annals of commercial female eroticism of course is the enormous constellation of talents gathered under one banner to make this cinematic wet dream come to shimmering vibrant life imperishable technicolor photography that will outlive us all a truckload of worthy character actors including one cute dog a music score by max steiner that seems determined to accomplish the composed film that michael powell who ironically had a bit part in the 1927 silent version always dreamed about tittering at times on the brink of dissonance but always coming through in splendid symphonic operatic exoticism a dream like atmosphere where material considerations are no object characters travel as if by magic from one spot to the next dialog is sparse vague and suggestive the art direction is close to celestial flower arrangements appear in the humblest hut or tent the heroine's wardrobe is inexhaustible and all the male characters are either aristocrats saints doomed but horny sinners mystics or poets br br ahh hollywood the mgm dvd presentation of this film is bare bones but impeccable the bit rate is very high throughout the colour registration is almost always perfect and the 2 0 mono sound truly does justice to max steiner's score and to boyer's penultimate confession br br a historical note on this sort of women's subject the following year 1937 julien duvivier visibly inspired by the garden of allah directed carnet de bal where a very similar clothes horse butter won't melt in her mouth heroine widowed after taking care of an ailing husband in the exotic remoteness of some impossibly romantic alpine lakeside villa wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book she finds them all in time only to realize that whatever feeling there was at one point between her beaus and herself were either misunderstood overestimated or else had lifelong tragic consequences it was duvivier's cynical way of telling us to beware of impossibly idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later
<START> i ended up watching this whole very long movie because i was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it it seems difficult to believe that so many famous people anthony quinn lawrence olivier john gielguld vittorio de sica etc would have willingly participated in this farce but maybe in 1968 people really were so naive the plot seems written by some confused latin american marxist priest with an agenda there is a superpower conflict and the russians are actually the good guys with the communist party general secretary being a nice and spiritual man who suddenly after 20 years sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a siberian gulag the priest then promptly becomes the pope by a series of coincidences we are allowed to see the secret vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imagine br br meanwhile the communists in china achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death to solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war in order to justly distribute the western capitalist riches to the poor workers of china br br our good old comrade general secretary gets a bit worried and calls the pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace they meet with the chinese leader comrade peng who looks and acts like a 15 year old boy you will roll on the floor laughing about what people in 1968 thought the chinese looked like comrade peng demands that the western capitalists must pay which is quite logical after all don't capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists and that the pope needs to sacrifice something too for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice br br so when the pope gets crowned in rome he pledges the entire wealth of the catholic church world wide to feed our poor chinese brethren in christ and thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust br br apart from this there are also some minor sub plots which alas provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie i'd give it three oscars for stupidity br br by the way anthony quinn looks quite unlikely as a pope he is much more plausible as zorba the greek
<START> this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen it shows a china i had never seen or imagined and i believe it shows 1930's china in the most real light ever seen in a movie it is absolutely heart breaking in so many situations seeing how hard life was for the characters and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film the actors are all perfect such that you feel like you have really entered a different world br br i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough it may just change you forever once you have seen it
