<START> popeye and big foot popeye's engine company getting popeye's goat 1 2 br br i used to lap these up as a kid but catching an episode of the series comprising three cartoons back to back now i e several years later they preceded the theatrical screening of the pirate yarn raiders of the seven seas 1953 i can see how they don't hold up all that well the character of popeye isn't exactly sympathetic to begin with olive oyl distinctly overbearing and bluto's antics failed to elicit much interest either Â in short the scripts were alarmingly thin fairly awful and generally unfunny to boot they're strictly juvenile fare yet i doubt today's kids would even have the patience to stick with them furthermore the animation style is unattractive br br taking each short per se i guess they improved from one to the other after the initial shock one adapted to its mediocre quality as it were so that the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot Â popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose immense appetite causes him no end of mischief hardly original i know but always an amusing ploy one interesting element here was that the shorts were bookended with popeye delivering moralistic bits of wisdom to the kids in the audience
<START> so 'thinner' yep this steven bachman read steven king yarn about a man who gets his just desserts from a gypsy elder who he just killed the story itself is there no doubt about it but i don't know why i didn't enjoy it more than i could have i guess what really distracted me was the actors i mean who's the lead robert john burke who's he and fer crying out loud can someone please stop hiring joseph mantegna for every italian mafioso role there ever is and while we're at it does every mafioso have to have a pasta cooking italian mother the only good acting job done here is under 10 pounds of makeup michael constantine as the gypsy elder he's pretty good but the rest i make you all better actors
<START> watched this french horror film last night and pretty much liked it the whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a hand written journal in a wall from a serial killer that had escaped the prison 20 years earlier somehow without leaving his cell as they look through the diary they discover it delves into the black arts and commands that might be their way out of the cell and to freedom what they find out is something completely different and horrifying to say the least i like low budget horror films that deliver the goods in a fairly quality way and tell a good story this movie does just that despite taking a while to get going the result and the horror they unleash is very interesting to me and i enjoyed the ride not a lot of gore but that wouldn't fit the story although the gore it has is pretty good
<START> my watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships as a lot has been written about the movie already it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved br br i think the point where jesse and celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with br br on the plot front making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish br br i believe in romantic flicks of such flavor the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer's and director's mind what the actors bring out is what becomes of them right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify to become the character the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story here both the actors do just the right job kudos and before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful
<START> this movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flicks i've seen the length wasn't nearly long enough to include a good storyline also the way the foster parents died was just plain ridiculous the mother suddenly dies from falling through a shower after tripping over an action figure and the dad is shot by a police officer i can see where some originality might have been what they were going for but it could have been better also the cheesiness of it all made me want to press stop before it was over after hearing all of lucy's name and figuring out it was 'lucifer' i wanted to gag yes it's interesting that lucifer was a woman but look at the name it's a male's name it should be given to a male character all in all the movie was a bore and could have used a better plot
<START> i actually didn't enjoy this movie br br i saw it at a camp and we didn't rave about it we laughed at it sure some parts are touching but the acting is terrible the effects are terrible and the whole overall movie idea is terrible now i know it was based on a book which i haven't read but i hope that the book was better than this because frankly i thought that this movie was very bad and boring like i said i went to it with a bunch of people from a camp and we were excited to be there plus i got a caffeinated drink but nonetheless i struggled to stay awake the only thing that kept me up other than my fear of being embarrassed once i woke up was the gunshots that were quite pointless as well i just really didn't like it
<START> this is a big step down after the surprisingly enjoyable original this sequel isn't nearly as fun as part one and it instead spends too much time on plot development tim thomerson is still the best thing about this series but his wisecracking is toned down in this entry the performances are all adequate but this time the script lets us down the action is merely routine and the plot is only mildly interesting so i need lots of silly laughs in order to stay entertained during a trancers movie unfortunately the laughs are few and far between and so this film is watchable at best
<START> good lord whoever made this turkey needs to be buried alive i'm sorry but the other reviewer must not have seen this movie he must be watching something else or have never seen a movie before 9 out of ten stars he's saying what this is as good as ben hur or gone with the wind unintentionally funny massively unbelievable characters absurd situations looks like it was shot in griffith park which works out pretty well mash was shot in griffith park crappy script just about everything that could possibly be wrong with a movie all rolled into one package should be required viewing for all prospective film makers as an example of how a movie could be horribly wrong it reminds me of something a usc student may make for a film class br br give this one a pass unless you do drugs and are into high camp
<START> after a long period in the space looking for the remains of planet krypton superman brandon routh returns to earth he misses lois lane kate bosworth who got married and has a son with richard white james marsden meanwhile lex luthor kevin spacey plots an evil plan using crystals he stole from the fortress of solitude to create a new land and submerge the usa br br after so many delightful movies of superman with the unforgettable christopher reeve or tv shows like lois and clark and teri hatcher or smallville a great expectation was created for the return of superman in this bryan singer's version unfortunately the awful story is too long and boring with many unnecessary parts lack of emotion and overrated in imdb in addition the romance between lois lane and superman is something shamefully ridiculous the twenty two years old actress kate bosworth is wrongly miscast playing the role of a mature reporter and experienced mother of a five years old boy brandon routh is two years younger than tom welling who plays a teenager clark kent in smallville the character of parker posey kitty kowalski is actually a silly caricature last but not the least and in spite of being a terrific lex luthor kevin spacey is forty five years old therefore older and older than the rest of the lead cast the corny conclusion looks like a soap opera and is terrible my vote is four br br title brazil superman returns
<START> this is a brilliant documentary that follows the life of herge and his creating tintin its based around a series of interviews conducted in 1971 and covers every thing from his early life and nazi collaboration to the final moments of his life br br brilliantly edited very cinematic and fast paced enough to not get boring this film will give you a new appreciation for the work of herge br br the film makers make the film more than just another documentary using the latest state of the art technology and for a change putting it to good use br br recently more and more documentaries have been making it to cinemas but this one as to be amongst the best
<START> as a great admirer of marlene dietrich i had to finally watch this very very dull picture it is miss dietrich's first color film and the world's most beautiful blond is a redhead bad start the story is a tremendous bore involving a subject which itself bores bores me stiff religious guilt who needs it suffice it to say perhaps that of all dietrich's films and i have seen most including pittsburgh this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching the color photography is ok this is a very early technicolor release but to no purpose ridiculous casting c aubrey smith basil rathbone enough said the only thing of any interest at all is john carradine's outlandish caricature of a performance as the sand diviner who foretells all that will happen the supposed happy ending is one of the most depressing ever conceived yet another example of david o selznick's highly inflated reputation did he ever make a really good film other than that one and for one final annoyance the soundtrack of the mgm dvd is a mess with volume levels seemingly randomized highly unrecommended
<START> richard pryor's early 80s running down the street on fire incident must have affected him somehow in his stand up he jokes about it getting great laughs it seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose the toy is about the lamest he ever chose aside from i guess another you br br a movie where a white man buys his son a black man nice little bit of underlying political incorrectness before thee was such a thing it's seeing richard getting all sentimental that made me finally walk out before the end i wanted to see pryor get even with this brat instead it becomes the misunderstood kid nauseum at least gleason had his moments ignore this and watch pryor with gene wilder or any of his '70s stuff this is a waste of any movie watcher's time
<START> for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time no exceptions james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller through films such as aliens the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science fiction goes he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful interesting and entertaining film about it the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose's and jack's story alone no one else emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home the music has become iconic and legendary it is composer james horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is only one problem the usual james cameron problem is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime my heart won't go on from this one
<START> this is just a terrible 'comedy' it really is a bad film there are no funny elements no jokes that are funny i don't know how some people can claim this dismal short film could be 'smartest' or 'quality ' perhaps if its the only film that a person has seen you can make that claim of the brothers but i have seen thousands of better films namely leonard part six now that's funny i don't know how the brothers is even considered eligible to be listed on the internet movie database its more like a home video than an actual film br br jokes aside just skip this film a root canal is more enjoyable that this cliche ridden unfunny material
<START> br br i must admit i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of 'cut' last night though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem i am a true horror fan as true as they come and found 'cut' to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced but one of the great parody comedy films of late br br my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements the film was not overly clever in it's application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could i am certain this was intended as humour hoping this was intended as humour br br and of course there was the gore br br the use of the 'customised' garden shears was brilliance besides the expected stabs and slashes in short there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth br br the appearance of both kylie minogue short that her appearance was and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film both performances were fantastic as well as simon bossell 'the castle' in a brilliant role as the jokey technician br br all in all i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years as well as a beautiful satire parody toungue in cheek till the very end br br loved it go see it
<START> as far as i know the real guy that the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it was an outstanding portrayal i'd agree with him this is a fantastic film about a quite gifted boy man with a special body part helping him oscar and bafta winning and golden globe nominated daniel day lewis plays christy browna crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor in a wheelchair and carried by his family he has a special left foot though he can write with it paint with it and hold things with it he learns to speak later in the film it is very good for a guy like him also starring home alone 2's oscar winning and golden globe nominated brenda fricker as mrs brown and bafta winning ray mcanally as mr brown it was nominated the oscars for best director for jim sheridan best writing screenplay based on material from another medium and best picture it was nominated the baftas for best film best make up artist and best adapted screenplay daniel day lewis was number 85 on the 100 greatest movie stars he was number 20 on the 50 greatest british actors he was number 9 on britain's finest actors and he was number 15 on the world's greatest actor and the film was number 28 on the 50 greatest british films outstanding
<START> that's right under 9 on average but maybe under 12s for some others i was 11 when i originally saw this on video and at such youth i wasn't able to notice the shoddy cartoon quality or the fact that those classic characters we have all grown to love are not the same or as good to see just about everything is so 2d here belle is i'll agree not even beautiful but just a plain looking woman with tinted skin she wears the same bright blue dress all the way through with not one glamorous dress on wardrobe is to say the least annoying my ears may bleed if i had to listen to her everyday lumiere in both the original and the christmas edition was suave and elegant but here he is a womanizing unfunny twit cogsworth despite being the no nonsense housekeeper he is famous for is a complete sh t and the most insufferable character i'd say he always seems to find shutting that unbearably grating pie hole of his very difficult in this one and whose clock face should really have been used for turning back in time to the unforgettable two film in this series poor poor mrs potts was not brought to life by angela lansbury one of my favourite classic actresses but by anne rogers who captured none of mrs potts' character no offence to her not if she did her best when the beast roars it sounds so horrifically fake with clearly no additional roars snarls or growls by a microphone i am aware that this is only a third feature following two other films so of course it wouldn't be as good but i'm sure that more of a contribution wouldn't have hurt the disney artists who indeed have achieved such remarkable styles of animation over the years it's alright i guess and i do watch it sometimes though only when it suits me it's quite difficult to make a recommendation for you reading this because it depends on how old you are but remember this will not at all be what you may expect following the earlier spectacular movies and to think that on my video of it the text on the back cover said boasting brilliant animation it's a nice little flick but for one thing it's also highly poor and for another those 3 words ought to have been saved for the next re release of the original
<START> i found this movie hilarious the spoofs on other popular movies of that time were some of the funniest i have seen in this sort of movie give it a try if you saw the movies that this movie is spoofing and you get the humor you should enjoy the movie br br i and the others who watched the movie with me felt the funniest part in the movie this is not a spoiler because i will not tell you what actually happens was a scene with the flashy thingy from mib when they first discover the device and do not know what it is does and then again later in the movie you'll understand when you get there br br my only complaint about the movie is that i have never been able to find it in dvd so that i could buy a copy
<START> i don't know about you but what i love about tom and jerry cartoons is the often violent interaction between the two characters mouse in manhattan sees jerry leaving tom behind to have an adventure in new york and as far as i am concerned this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat br br as magical as jerry's exploration of the 'big apple' might be for the other t j fans who have commented here on imdb i couldn't wait for this self indulgent rubbish to end so i could watch the next cartoon on my dvd br br in fact the only part of the whole episode that i genuinely enjoyed was when jerry almost 'buys the farm' hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle hundreds of feet above a busy road
<START> i went to go see this at the esquire theatre in cincy oh and i hate my life now br br christopher reeves would have been a more believable boxer br br as a film it was painful but seeing bret carr in person was to see desperation at its pinnacle br br my favorite part of the movie was seeing bc slammed in the face with what appeared to be a c battery the jury is still out on this it was from a dildo and it was in slow mo yep br br shoot the left side of the face only people become famous by demanding things bret carr b carr donned a chicken suit for a bit of reverse psychology roaming the streets of clifton bashing his own film he should this is correct to bash the film br br my soul felt chafed after this movie br br bret carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of a cult or smart enough for that matter that is the feeling you get from the what the bleepesque trickle of brainwashed impressionable neo yuppies that came to see this bret carr piece of work br br it's an emotionally draining experience just thinking about writing about this film so goodbye br br anonymous
