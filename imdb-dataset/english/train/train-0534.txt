<START> soon after watching this film you will realize why it didn't even make it to the theaters this movie does not deserve the prequel tag instead this is a common theme in hollywood rip off previously good movies with disastrous prequels sequels etc br br this film's plot was bouncing all over the place like a ping pong ball and the character development was non existent i seriously felt like i was watching a comedy at some points in the movie because the acting was so bad p diddy needs to stop tainting movies with his horrible acting he actually made me laugh every time br br the only good thing that comes out of this movie is jaclyn desantis who looks excellent in this movie and actually brought some enjoyment from watching this film br br if you are a big carlito's way fan i recommend you not watch this if you decide to watch it anyway then treat this movie as if it ripped off the original because that is exactly what it did
<START> ever since i started visiting this site and voting for movies i have never given any movie a rating of 1 even the disturbing dance workout with barbie got a 2 there is a reason for this br br any time i find myself watching what i think is a really bad movie i have to stop and ask myself the following question is this movie really as bad as the horrific soul sucking beast that is 'theodore rex' and i've never been able to answer yes br br i would give anything within reason to know what crackhead said hey let's remake 'blade runner' with barney in the harrison ford role and decided it was a good idea to actually spend the time and money to commit it to film furthermore i want to know what the hell kind of market they were going to sell this towards if it hadn't gone strait to video this is that rare monster a movie that is way too violent for kids and way too insanely stupid for adults i'd ask what were they thinking but in this case it might actually be redundant br br anyhow all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if you're one of the five or six rabid fans of howard the duck or if you are curious to see the most evil insane movie of all time or you want to really punish yourself
<START> i absolutely loved this show i watched it from the time it first aired in the late 90's to the very last episode in my honest opinion it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days definitely a show you could watch with a friend or your children yes things have changed a bit with jo since we last saw her in the books but it's still compelling with great stories and good lessons the actress that portrays jo bhaer michelle burke does a wonderful job as does as the actor who plays nick riley spencer rochfort throughout the series we get to see the developing romance between jo and nick as well as the daily stories and lessons the kids and students learn i recommend this show to anyone
<START> it takes guts to make a movie on gandhi in india in which he is not shown as a man who could do no wrong this movie shows how a mahatma failed to be a decent father at least in the eyes of his son br br the performances are terrific the cinematography fantastic the direction fabulous but the film drags if the intention was to make this movie without any box office expectations which i assume is the case here then its a brilliant attempt but if the makers were expecting this to be a commercial success then the film's fate was doomed the day they chose this subject br br 20 yrs from now this movie will be remembered for the brilliant portrayal of harilal by akshaye khanna he deserves an oscar nomination for this one and honestly his is not the only performance worth applauding shefali chhaya is terrific too br br watch the scene where harilal hears about his father's death no dialogues no screaming but a speechless shot by khanna its one of the finest scenes ever shot in the history of cinema br br gandhi my father is not at all exciting cinema but yes its excellent cinema and a must watch brilliant attempt
<START> what would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having his bachelor party with some of his closest friends at a hawaiian guy bar all smooth sailing until he takes his bachelor hat off what would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her what would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of his finance a new low right well paul coleman played comically by jason lee leads this experience of a nauseous blur and a new low i got to say this is one of his good leading roles however i do believe his role in vanilla sky was better acted br br his finance named karen is played by the up and down actress selma blair while karen's character becky is played by the lovely and talented julia stiles getting back to where we left off paul now has to deal with one arising problem to another he gets diseases has to deal with certain people and has to play his lie games with stealth or any member of each of the families could get p o'ed including one of his relatives that hasn't had a bowel movement for 14 days vomit all of this leads to the long awaited wedding with one hilarious scene before it recapping all the hell that paul and his brother had to go through br br overall a guy thing is quite funny and is all right sometimes the story may seem to go nowhere and you get tired of scenes here and there but it's a mixed movie and if you're a canadian and a fellow fan of the ctv brett butt sitcom corner gas you'd recognize a small role played by fred ewanuick the same man who plays the hilarious hank in the series this movie is all right it's another feather in lee's hat quite an empty hat so far however br br my rating 7 10 br br eliason a
<START> the movie is a total crap we have two good actors who are miscast and a meat head of an actor salman khan just to attract the female audience the story is a crap the characters poorly sketched non existent story telling no editing to speak of ajay devgan as a rock star that is a dream in itself the movie drags along to the point of decadence the whole charade about arjun bringing his manna to london let him grope his girlfriend and let him not play at wembley vimbley in the dubbing process is absurd salman khan's over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch i remember seeing some good movies from this producer vipul shah but this is not one of them it seems all the good directors are falling prey to the box office mania that the mumbai media morons have created this is yet another crap movie in the lines of wanted with idiot actor like salman khan who has no place in a good hindi cinema he is good to the indian cinema as titanic was to the winter cruise business on a positive note i like asin character dancing bharatnatyam when she changes to the western style dancing when the teacher is not looking
<START> this movie proves that you can't judge a movie by the awesome artwork on the dvd cover it also goes to show that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it or get it for someone at christmas the beginning of this movie actually looks somewhat promising well until you meet the characters pumpkin jack the old guy from down the street brings the college co eds a book full of witch's spells that he leaves at their annual haunted house where the movie takes place after that there is some drinking fighting and soft core porn then the action of the movie finally takes place after over an hour br br overall hallow's end was predictable unsuspensful and reminiscent of a soft core porn this movie is probably best viewed with a group of friends who have nothing better to do as it is a good movie to make fun of and for first time viewers it is really fun making predictions of the order of people who die
<START> now i won't deny that when i purchased this off ebay i had high expectations this was an incredible out of print work from the master of comedy that i so enjoy however i was soon to be disappointed apologies to those who enjoyed it but i just found the compleat al to be very difficult to watch i got a few smiles sure but the majority of the funny came from the music videos which i've got on dvd and the rest was basically filler you could tell that this was not al's greatest video achievement that honor goes to uhf honestly i doubt if this will ever make the jump to dvd so if you're an ultra hardcore al fan and just have to own everything buy the tape off ebay just don't pay too much for it
<START> well i must say this is probably the worst film i have seen this year the jokes were extremely crude wasn't expecting it from as pg movie rated pg in canada and they weren't funny with this great cast i at least expected some good acting but i didn't even get that i am a huge rainn wilson fan and this is the first time i was extremely disappointed by his performance neither luke wilosn or uma thurman's characters are the least bit likable and i really could have cared less what happened to either of them i didn't expect this at all as in the past i have really liked other movies by this director six days seven nights for example this movie was not worth the 10 it cost me and i strongly encourage you not to see this movie i guarantee that you will be like me begging for this movie to be over
<START> i just saw this movie the other day when i rented it and i thought this was going to be just another movie with a girl trying to prove a point but diane joined boxing because she wanted to i thought this movie was good i gave it a 8 10 that's how good it is plus a movie with michelle rodriguez is always good even is she's been in only six
<START> although this film is somewhat sanitized because it was made at a time when people just didn't talk about sex it is an extremely helpful short film to show prepubescent girls so they know what to expect during menstruation not surprisingly it was paid for by the kotex company though what may surprise many is that disney made this film as they made a lot of educational films during the 1940s 60s however well made the film is though i think the film maker's missed a real opportunity instead of the nice female narrator's voice and the relatively bland visuals it would have been great if they'd used minnie mouse and the rest of the disney gang i know this would have given old walt a heart attack but wow that would have been a great film by the way although the notion of sex is barely hinted at in the film it does adequately explain menstruation in general however it does lack some details especially about intercourse that i assume were included in the accompanying booklet br br now if only i can figure out why i watched a cartoon about menstruation
<START> in one word excruciating i was advised to read some articles about this film's philosophical meanings afterward but having sat through the movie's interminable 115 minutes and being slowly crushed beneath its bloated symbolism and lava flowing oppressiveness it seemed better to just report my reactions to the movie after all who goes to see a movie with a syllabus in hand and this flick was dismal lead actor claude laydu from the film's opening to its end wears the same wearying and annoying mask of agony as to be practically indistinguishable from the film's eternal dreary voice over filming one over the other might have worked better than subjecting an audience to both as they basically say the same thing the priest of ambricourt is a wretched human being the story about a persecuted priest who tries to help out a troubled rich family does nothing toward making its characters remotely interesting or sympathetic as the family are a bunch of unpleasant weirdos and the priest himself comes across as a nosy pest the last 30 minutes suggests some breath taking message about grace and one man's suffering equaling that of others but due to all the indulgent close ups of a suffering laydu and the vague subtext in robert bresson's script all i felt was finally it's over let's have some ice cream interesting for fans of bresson fanatic paul schrader just to see how many elements of character and setting schrader carried into in his own scripts and movies especially taxidriver raging bull and light sleeper
<START> faithful to the work of pearl s buck whose years spent in china as a child of missionary parents that provided her with deep insights into the chinese culture and its philosophy this film adaptation is brilliantly done both in technically artistry and acting br br wang lung is a humble farmer grateful for the basics of life to survive off of his land and to be newly wed to olan a servant to a rich and powerful family in the village area despite wang lung and olan's best efforts to farm the land raise kids and build savings and wealth a famine threatens to wipe out everything they have worked for choosing not to sell their land a traditional asian belief they instead journey to a major city to wait out the famine while in the city they are reduced to begging and being just one of hundreds of other unfortunate homeless families although not a looter olan gets caught up in a mob looting at a rich man's house she's summarily rounded up for execution by the army but is saved at the last minute her good fortune however is that she found valuable jewels at the looting site that affords her and her family the opportunity to return to their farm to start over again the newly found wealth transforms wang lung he becomes selfish self centered and takes credit for the find he becomes a very rich farmer but that only makes matters worse as he increasingly becomes more unappreciative arrogant and difficult to reason with he loses touch with the basic things in life that money can't buy loyalty commitment trust fairness and honesty as punishment nature once again turns the table on wang lung by sending a plague of locust to destroy everything he has brought to his knees wang lung enlists the aid of all friends former friends workers and family with all that help he succeeds in saving the farm from that experience he once again returns to humbleness and an appreciation for the basics in life
<START> the final chapter in the hanzo the razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of samuraisploitation inoue replaces yasuzu masumura blind beast red angel manji in the director's chair but the style is pretty much the same perhaps due to shintaro katsu serving as the producer apart from the titular antihero br br hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake of course hanzo being hanzo he's not put off by the fact she's a ghost so he proceeds to rape ahem interrogate her using the now familiar revolving net device the plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks corrupt officials promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash hanzo's superior officer onishi and his two servants provide the typical comedic notes and generally it's business as usual br br significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first which is all over the place and a bit of a mess less stylish dramatic and bloody than the second arguably the finest in the hanzo series but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits complete with trademark training sequences the obligatory rape swordfights and a mystery hanzo is called upon to investigate this will ultimately satisfy the fans
<START> look there's nothing spectacularly offensive about this film it's just boring it's a typical rom com with an ending you can see coming before you've seen so much as the trailer the key difference is that the classic rom coms tackle their stories with wit and a lack of pretension this movie has no pretension but it really has no sense of movement you feel as though you could get up and walk away at any moment the production of the movie also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago i'd recommend re watching a classic movie like when harry met sally instead of this shallow imitation oh one other big problem no chemistry if you're used to seeing michael looking all cute as vaughn in alias you're going to be seriously disappointed with the way they've made him look here
<START> there is just one word for this film appalling the director clearly has talent but like his character robert carmichael he throws it all away br br carmichael has potential but like cray he can't be bothered to use it being drawn into petty crime and then descending into depravity is cray's vision of british youth like the british tabloids this film portrays young people with no aspirations or respect cray cries out for attention but deserves none br br i was appalled by the act of violence that cray chose to shove in the faces of the audience he assumes the audience are ignorant of world atrocities like a piece of obscene graffiti on a toilet wall he shows us male depravity with adolescent glee br br some actors of quality have small parts in this film danny dyer and leslie manville both make short appearances the acting is otherwise amateur the young men joe and ben are cringe making carmichael played by daniel spencer is creepy miranda wilson plays monica the attractive wife of celeb chef jonathon michael howe how she was able to subject herself to such an ordeal is beyond belief the film is never subtle and monica is treated to the most gratuitous violence which is cut with war action war imagery is used to convey the idea that young men cannot help themselves that acts of violence will occur within even civilised countries this is most certainly true and is symptomatic of our altered society where males have an increasingly less important position but cray descends to the level of the barbaric males he seeks to expose through his use of such brutal and violent images the female characters in the film offer no relief they are either victims or in manville's case a washed out mother the community is represented as dysfunctional br br this is cray's first film i listened to what he had to say during a q and a session at edinburugh and he is not unintelligent he simply lacks experience and his film exposes his naivety the film is due to be released later this year but i hope the company goes bust cos the public really don't need this kind of messed up material
<START> i watched this show and i simply didn't find it funny at all it might have been the first episode lately i realize abc is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station all the characters on this show are pretty bad actors but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down i would say that i believe this show will be cancelled but seeing as how abc is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing they might just keep this one simply because it's average compared to them
<START> playing kaddiddlehopper col san fernando etc the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream i love watching him interact w amanda blake or don knotts or whomever he clearly was having a ball and i think he made it easier on his guests as well so long as they knew ahead of time it wasn't a disciplined 19 take kind of production relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there br br he reminds me of guys like milton berle benny hill maybe jerry lewis some too great timing ancient gags that kept audiences in stitches for decades sheer enjoyment about what he was doing his sad little clown he played was good too but in a touching manner br br personally i think he's great having just bought a two dvd set of his shows from '61 or so it brings his stuff back in a fond way for me i can remember seeing him on tv at the end of his run when he was winding up the series in 1971 or so br br check this out if you are a fan or curious he was a riot
<START> this is a poem on film wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry it captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly italy's lake district in the twenties it's a love story with a twist the characters are unique and believable the settings are deliciously exotic some of the scenes the funeral boat in the fog the high long shot of the chess table in the centre of an intricately patterned tile floor are beautiful images and rather than the mandatory happy ending this story has a bitter sweet one if film is an art this is close to a masterpiece br br
<START> c'mon people look at the title lol i remember seeing this movie on saturday late night creature features years ago it's a great cheesy monster flick with hilariously bad acting and two wonderfully moronic hillbillies that add to the schlock factor the 2 redneck boat rental guys are the movie lol and you'll love the boat scene where the english guy and his wife are talking about all the stars and it's midday and sunny bloody hilarious you can tell they just didn't care about plot they just wanted to blow through the filming of the movie as fast as possible bottom line you'll love it if you love 70's schlock
