<START> i first rented this film many years ago and was completely enthralled by it just recently feeling a strange need to revisit some of the way too few films that i've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime i decided to give erendira another look and i'm glad i did as i soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film br br the story is about a teenaged girl erendira played remarkably by claudia o'hana in some respects she resembles winona ryder who accidentally burns down her grandmother's mansion after which the grandmother played downright hypnotically by irene papas forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages br br the viewing is at once fascinating and compelling though inspite of the basic premise which deals with prostitution is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content the story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn which by the way is in the rough and tumble part of rural mexico br br the film is very atmospheric arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality it sometimes borders on the bizarre but not to the point of say a david lynch film it's also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature read the comments from previous viewers below br br often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion quiet and melancholy adding just the right musical accents to highlight the mexican setting the cinematography of the rural places many of which are in the desert is quite superb br br the film moves at a nice pace neither too fast nor too slow and after every scene i felt i had to rewind the tape and play it over again just because it makes you want to do that for me anyway it really is that compelling br br hopefully you will see the film in its spanish language version with subtitles i studied spanish in high school as well as in college and i was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue por ejemplo el mundo no es tan grande como pensaba the world's not as big as i thought i e it's a small world br br this film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine which upon drinking is immensely satisfying however you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren't more bottles just like this one
<START> was it a thriller as i thought when i saw the cover at the video library no was it a 'food fr thought' as the author was maybe trying to make it not really so what was it it was a very average movie that had great potential and was nicely directed but let down by a confusing story without strong points beginning middle and end with poor acting expect from the serial killer guy who although he seemed overzealous at some points delivered the best performance of the cast overall it was nice cinematography with good colours cool hi tec stuff beautiful scenics but leaves you lost about where it's going and where it has just been and with a feeling of let's just quickly wrap it up in the end ok to watch if there's nothing else on tv
<START> i can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante flick but this is just bad and not bad in a way you might enjoy seeing mst3k make fun of it it's just nauseatingly bad like you can't find anything to enjoy about this no matter how hard you try i truly regret wasting 2 hours of precious life on this crap you can tell by watching it that no one was asked to act and everyone in it knew this film would only bury their careers apparently walking tall has garnered enough income that someone decided they could make a buck off their investment if it's not the worst film i've seen it's so bad that it's blotted the worse films from my memory
<START> this is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate it looks as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack slade lived and died idaho colorado territories and montana it fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious 'bad man ' 'good man ' the script is horrible there is very little direction and lousy acting dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack slade in real life jack slade was a very good stage line superintendent he was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking when drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in virginia city montana to insure that he could never terrorize them again vigilantes lynched jack slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately this is a horrible movie i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood butches history at will even to this day
<START> i am a fan of the previous best of the best films but this one was awful no wonder i had such a hard time finding it i tried 4 video rental stores until i found one with a copy of this movie the acting was terrible the plot was a joke and the action was bad as well br br i really miss alex grady travis brigley and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this film had with the first 2 movies br br john
<START> deliverance is the fascinating haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by james dickey turned into a brilliant movie by john boorman it's about four businessmen driven by manhood and macho behavior who're spending a canoeing weekend high up in the mountains up there they're faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery poverty buggery and even physical harassment these four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain land completely estranged from all forms of civilisation all these elements actually make deliverance one of the most nightmarish films i've ever seen just about everything that happens to these men you pray that you'll never find yourself to be in a similar situation pure talking cinema deliverance is a very important movie as well john boorman's best closely followed by zardoz and excalibur was and still is a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies just think about the terrific duelling banjos musical score and of course the unforgettable homosexual squeal like a pig rape scene all the actors deliver haha perfect acting performances especially jon voight a must see motion picture
<START> this show was absolutely terrible for one george isn't funny and his kids are snobby little brats he also treats his mother with no respect as a hispanic i am highly offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed br br plus the dysfunctional family thing's been done to death for once i want to see something original what makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times i thought abc would come to its senses and pull this piece of garbage off the air but sadly we're going to have to stomach this until they jump the shark br br in my opinion they already did
<START> robert colomb has two full time jobs he's known throughout the world as a globetrotting tv reporter less well known but equally effortful are his exploits as a full time philanderer br br i saw vivre pour vivre' dubbed in english with the title 'live for life ' some life robert seems to always have at least three women in his life one mistress on her way out one on her way in and the cheated wife at home it helps that robert is a glib liar among his most useful lies are i'll call you tomorrow' and my work took longer than planned ' he spends a lot of time and money on planes trains and hotel rooms for his succession of liaisons you wonder when this guy will get caught with his pants down br br some may find his life exciting but i thought it to be tedious his companions including his wife catherine are all attractive and desirable women but his lifestyle is so hectic and he is so deceitful you wonder if he's enjoying all this br br adding to the tedium is considerable footage that doesn't further the plot there are extended sections with no dialogue or french only dialogue we see documentaries of wars torture and troop training interspersed with the live action when robert's flight returns from africa we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal br br annie girardot is the standout performer in this film hers was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection it was also nice to see candice bergen at the beginning of her career i can't find fault with yves montand's performance of what was basically an amoral bum br br i enjoyed some of claude lelouch's novel techniques in a hotel room scene the camera pans around the room as robert and his mistress argue we catch sight of them briefly during each pass around the room in another scene set on a sleeping car of a train robert is lying on the upper bunk while his wife is on the lower robert is giving his wife some important but distressing news but we hear only parts of it because of the clatter of the train i sensed that his wife was also unable to absorb every word due to the shocking nature of the news i also liked the exciting safari scenes in africa the cinematography of those scenes and of those in amsterdam was superb br br i reviewed this movie as part of a project at the library of congress i've named the project fifty 50 notable films forgotten within 50 years as best i can determine this film like the other forty nine i've identified has not been on video telecast or distributed in the u s since its original release in my opinion it is worthy of being made available again br br
<START> simply well written directed and acted woody's best of the 2000's if not his best since the 80's hugh jackman was the perfect pick for his roll scarlett johansson's banter with woody proves how well rounded an actress she has become br br it's refreshing to not being in a romance on screen with the leading lady he plays the perfect bumbling magician br br there have been a few reviews maligning this movie don't let them stop you from seeing the wonderfully done film people in the crowd i saw this with were laughing so loud at some lines i missed the next line if you like woody allen films of the 70's you'll regret missing this one br br i suggest you go to watch this film with an open mind if you do you might walk out smiling
<START> oh the hilarity oh the joy another film that is so bad it's good or so i thought in actual fact this one misses the so bad its good phase and goes sadly straight to the could have been so bad its good but they screwed it up and made it plain bad br br for a start its way too long cut half an hour and it might have been more endurable then put in such ludicrous plots as the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the earth because he has all the food stockpiled and he'll be rich if the mission fails duh or the talking bomb plot device last seen in dark star guess what just like in dark star the bomb has a malfunction hmmmm add in a dash of we can't act our way out of a kindergarten play and you have solar crisis in a nutshell br br light relief is to be had in the form of jack palance or jack pants as we called him in this flick whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a kid around the desert and telephone the kid's dad to come pick him up eventually between driving and phoning jack dispenses pointless drivel and leers and cackles a lot but contributes little to the story such as it is in short he's the best bit of the movie br br my award for the most ironic line delivered straight faced goes to charlton heston who when meeting his eldest son for the first time in ages comments that his son looks a little out of shape whilst he himself is standing there with his gut bulging over his waistband and in dire need of a captain kirk corset br br also amusing is the bad guy's top henchman who has a bright white hairstyle that kept making me think of andy warhol for some reason br br apart from these hilarities there's little to recommend this movie the ending is a sequence copied from but mercifully shorter than the end sequence from 2001 br br tips for enjoying this movie more if you are foolish enough to watch it like i did br br 1 any time the bomb speaks imagine it's called tarquin trust me it works br br 2 whenever chuck heston is on screen and about to speak pre empt him by reciting a line from planet of the apes such as get your filthy paws off me or similar br br 3 whenever the female lead is looking stressed this is most of the time keep hoping against hope that she's having an aneurism and will die soon br br 4 during the interminable the ship's broke again scenes keep hoping the tech engineer guys will spout a scotty ism like you cannae change the laws of physics or some such crap br br other than that do what it takes to get you through this one i dozed off half way through and woke to realise i hadn't missed anything nor had the plot laughable though it is advanced any so don't worry about tuning out for a few you won't miss anything
<START> this movie is very entertaining and any critique is based on personal preferences not the films quality other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by murphy the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor it has some pretty good special effects and exciting action scenes br br as a finder of lost children murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl which leads him on the path for which others believe he was chosen to protect the golden child the young boy is born as an enlightened one destined to save the world from evil forces but whose very life is in danger if not for the help of murphy and his beautiful mysterious and mystical helper guide protector br br also there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts one such scene is where the golden child that murphy's character is solicited to protect is tested by the monks of the mountain temple an elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from and the child is tested on his choice br br this is a fantasy comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware as we accept this premise of the plot we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us br br this is an excellent movie with a good plot fine acting and for the most part pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of martial art fighting and eddie murphy humor
<START> redundant everlasting shots useless shots useless scenes are what you will find in this film in other words it seemed technically poor to me the musical bits are amateurishly directed no synchronization in the would be dancing badly post synchronized bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time etc br br the film is long and boring eventually it makes few point and even less sense br br there are some good ideas though some of the comic elements are actually efficient especially the opening scene however the film gets worse and worse so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand by the end br br the trailer i saw was very dynamic that is not true for the film that is to say the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a rip off
<START> my title just about sums this heap of crap up i should have taken a hint when i saw it was a fred olen ray movie but i thought 'hey it might be better than his usual rubbish' boy was i wrong this has to be the worst movie ever targeted at children the acting was awful the humour was non existent the direction was the worst i have ever seen the special effects wouldn't seem out of place on a 1950's disney movie br br what has happened to dee wallace stone who once had such a promising career in the 80's movie veteran former child actor russ tamblyn was a awful bad guy the budget was so low it was a totally unbelievable even as a kiddie movie br br i haven't seen the sequel made in 1999 and nor do i intend to br br if you want a good kid movie watch 'honey i shrunk blew up the kids kid' or any disney movie br br my rating as a 19 yo 2 10 br br rating as a kid movie 3 10 at the best
<START> i liked antz but loved a bug's life the animation that was put into this paid off i will definitely be getting this on dvd by the way disney should make a widescreen version of this movie on tape i heard talk of squishing all of the characters into the screen on the standard video format most will have to agree that the ending credits were the funniest i only saw one of the two sets but i can't wat to see the other one
<START> enchanted april is a tone poem an impressionist painting a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words it has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out i continue to wait albeit less patiently for the film to come out in dvd format apparently i am not alone br br if parent company amazon's listings are correct there are many people who want this title in dvd format many people want to go to italy with this cast and this script many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries the cast is spectacular the cinematography and direction impeccable the film is a definite keeper many have already asked please add our names to the list

<START> of the films of the young republic few in number as they are the buccaneer 1958 stands out as a finely crafted film charleton heston excels in his portrayal of old hickory's defence of new orleans with a thrown together force of militia regulars and pirates promised a reprieve br br after christmas 1814 peninsula veterans led by sir edward packenham the duke of wellington's brother in law bore down on the city of new orleans andy jackson had a day to draw together a scratch force to defend the city behind bales of hay br br charlton heston projects jackson's terrifying presence and awe inspiring power of command yet there are a few colorful comic relief with the might of the english lioness about to pounce a young blond haired voluteer from new orleans asks i guess the ruckus is about to start br br the battle was about to rage but not for long true to form the british marched straight into withering american fire in less than a few minutes an attempt to reconquer lost north american territories had been foiled br br the battle scene in this movies lasts slightly longer than the actual battle itself br br there are colorful side stories in this film of the young volunteer at his first dance to celebrate the victory
<START> the clichÃ©d polynesian males drink fight and make a stream of sexist stupid and unfunny remarks real life polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped cardboard characters the supposedly samoan girl didn't look or act samoan at all seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim with weak as water story lines you can't say anything about the acting even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script it's sad to see polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene and only two or three 'jokes' what a waste of kiwi taxpayers' money what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community it's better not to make movies if they're as bad and mindless as this
<START> i have never commented on imdb before but i feel i have to after watching the batman animation its absolute rubbish warner brothers had the perfect animation series in batman in the early 90s so what the hell are they doing trying to mess with the winning formula i feel like writing a complaint letter to wb the original animation was dark and brooding exactly the way batman was intended to be wb had to mess this up with some tripe batman of the future now they produce this drivel the joker doesn't remotely resemble the joker from dc comics dc should sue i urge everyone who agrees with me to email or write to wb and use people power to get back the original formula
