<START> this is a very good movie do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are knocking this movie i will tell you in this movie you have a black criminal who outwits a white professor a black cop who tells the white professor he is wrong for defending the black criminal and the black cop turns out to be right thus Âmaking the white professor look stupid it always comes down to race this is an excellent movie pay no attention to the racist if you can get over that there are characters who are played by blacks in this movie who outsmart the white characters then you shouldn't have any problems enjoying this movie i recommended everyone to go see this movie
<START> i'm fan of art i like anything about art i like paintings sculptures etc this movie shows it so i like it a lot it shows how a woman wants to paint anything about art especially naked bodies but she can't do it because of her strict family father at the beginning of the movie she painted herself naked but she wanted a man for her paintings but her family didn't let her paint naked men because it's against the moral even so artemisia could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked she falls in love with her art teacher and it seems the art teacher is absolutely in love with her too so at the ending he sacrifices his freedom for hers by lying he said that he raped her but it wasn't true artemisia fell in love with him but if she says that she will suffer a lot because in the trial in which artemisia her father and the art teacher were somebody was hurting her artistic hands to say the truth i think this a great movie about art and an artistic love it's worth watching valentina cervi is great as artemisia she acts very well i also like her performance in the portrait of a lady as pansy osmond 8 5 10
<START> drss1942 really took the words right out of my mouth i loved segal's early films and feel like the only one who is still faithful to him i just saw this movie ok fell asleep about 90 through so i didn't see the end when i woke up and saw i was at the dvd menu i was thankful i didn't subject myself to any more of that movie and didn't dare find out what happened at the end there was something strange about the voice of segal and others kinda reminded me of the original mad max where the voice were dubbed but in the same language australlian is english right anyway if i had 10 thumbs they'd all point down right now for this segal injustice
<START> pretty poor firestarter clone that seems more like a bad tv movie than a bad feature film how disappointing for this to come from hooper and dourif br br government contractors do a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb the boy born to the couple from the experiment constantly runs a fever of 100 degrees and when he's an adult people in his life start spontaneously combusting he tries to find out why br br the people completely on fire are well done but when they get to the point that they are well done in another sense they're obviously changed to dummies when jets of fire shoot out of characters' arms it looks silly rather than alarming the way it should also ridiculous is fire that evidently travels through phone lines and erupts in huge jets from the receiver's earpiece how is that supposed to happen exactly br br something else that struck me as silly about the movie is when a character has visions of his late parents we later see the exact same shots from those visions in home movies
<START> rating 4 out of 10 br br as this mini series approached and we were well aware of it for the last six months as sci fi channel continued to pepper their shows with bg ads i confess that i felt a growing unease as i learned more br br as with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time different people go to it to see different things in this regard when people think of battlestar galactica they remember different things for some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor for others it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time many forget the state of special effects during the late 70s especially those on television for some the memories resolve around the story arc others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they faced br br frankly i come from the latter group the core of battlestar galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire yes evil the cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it while base stars were swirling around men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources and somehow they managed to survive until the next show they didn't survive because they had better technology or more fire power they survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next show br br the show had its flaws and at times was sappy but they were people you could care about br br the writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this in some ways he took the least significant part of the original show the character's names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction since that was their goal they can be judged on how well they accomplished it failure it was far from a reinvention in fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time it borrows liberally from st tng st ds9 babylon 5 and even battlefield earth i find that unfortunate br br ronald d moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade and has made contribution to some of the most popular television science fiction that you could hope to see one of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the enterprise d e that was the inviolable rule of roddenberry's st tng like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority ron moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master gene roddenberry here instead of writing the best story possible he has created a dysfuntional cast as i have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could besides being dysfunctional some of it was not the least bit believable anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days in hack they could have gotten execution and they never would have gotten out the next day it wouldn't have happened period especially in time of war br br the thing that i remembered most of ron moore's earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of capt james kirk he killed capt kirk and alas for me he has killed battlestar galactica
<START> i hope the viewer who regards 'dream machine' as one of corey haim's finest and the best movies of the century was kidding undetected sarcasm on my part i sincerely hope so br br 'the dream machine' marks the first of a long line of mediocre capers that would plague the rest of corey haim's career except 'prayer of the rollerboys' which was surprisingly decent here haim plays nonchalant college boy bernie who supposes that a cool car will attract his dream girl's attention lucky for bernie a rich woman aiming to get back at her cheating husband hastily decides to reward her faithful piano tuner bernie with a gift a slick porsche turbo however unbeknownst to the woman and unfortunate for bernie is that her dead husband was murdered and his body was hidden in the trunk now being that in this movie bodies don't seem to decay or possess a rather foul funk bernie is unaware of this in fact the oblivious boy has no idea that something suspicious is afoot despite several odd circumstances that arise in particular a grizzly man follows him around desperate to get hold of that body relatively undetected br br this is a low grade action fizzle as many of haim's films like this are see the double o kid despite being part action part romantic comedy this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first forty five minutes in which the filmmakers take more than enough time to show the immediate problem i e bernie being in possession of a car and a dead body and a hit man finding out that the porsche is going to be hard to find after which and thanks to poor acting by haim i loved this kid too but it's not exactly sacrilegious to admit the times when he obviously couldn't act well and the lack of real immediacy and emergency between bernie and the villain that makes much of the events unconvincing and as a result inappreciable to add injury to insult the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like self evident songs you would hear in team america see the 'date' montage br br loyal corey haim fans however should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance however others understanding that haim's career probably peaked when he was 14 or 15 and never recovered might expect mediocrity as will viewers just looking for early 90s b comedy fluff to pass the time
<START> this is the single worst movie i have ever seen let me say that again this is the single worst movie i have ever seen br br it had all of the ear marks of a bad movie continuity errors bad writing bad acting bad production value bad music i thought that there were a couple points to horror movies the first is that it is supposed to be suspenseful enough to scare you this movie gets and f in this category the second point is that when a character dies or something bad happens to them we are supposed to care this movie gets an f in this regard as well br br the first story a woman gets mauled by wolves after being afraid that this would happen to her the next story an ocd guy dies from not being careful and talks to a dead friend of his oh and then there is the horrific nail biting story of a bad roommate come on could you pick topics a little more interesting and a little less common than being alone in a house being anal retentive and having a roommate turns out all of these stories where hallucinations virtual reality induced by a doctor who in turn uses it himself wow stupid br br let me explain something i enjoy watching bad horror movies and laughing at how bad they are i couldn't do that with this one it was utter pain to sit and watch do not under any circumstance watch this movie you will regret it
<START> this film came recommended as a good action film which i don't really think it is i found the story convoluted and not all that easy to follow there really isn't that much action until the end of the film and it's pretty dark and hard to see what's really happening i was sure hoping for something different but alas didn't find it here
<START> this guy has no idea of cinema okay it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship this all is very good but look carefully he does not know his job the scenes are unbalanced without proper start and and with a disordered content and full of emptiness he has nothing to say about the subject so he over licitates with violence nakedness and gutter language how is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art why don't they let him succumb in piece
<START> i'm always suprised on how different all people are and how for almost every movie you get both extremes people who think it's the best movie and people who think it's the worst br br stigmata wouldn't be the worst movie i've ever seen but it's up there first of all the sound the producers spent more time on the soundtrack than the editing it was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking and then when patrica was talking in her monotone voice she could hardly be heard br br i usually like patrica and gaberial but they were both flat in this movie patrica had basically 3 emotions quiet in great pain or really angry she has stigmata the first was the predominate one the second involved screaming pain the third involving raising her voice it was loudness that distiguished the three and not emotion br br maybe i missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots everyone was talking about or maybe i was distracted by the terrible filming and mtv like style when you watch a 3 minute video you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story in a 2 hour feature film it's nauseating i fail to see the meaning of her seeing that women across the steet and dropping a child and no pittsburg does not rain that often br br i think maybe a real story with something to say could have been intended but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to do slow rain drop shots and renting that gorgous apartment that ms arquett lived in that they ended up firing the guy with the story
<START> possible spoilers br br i recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences ron ely is just right as doc cool calm almost always in control and with an occasional twinkle in his eye what more can one ask for i have never read a doc savage book so i don't know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derring do many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark which i don't think is fair the difference in budget is astounding raiders must have at least 10 times the budget doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has special effects are also at a minimum but come on people the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right the sousa music is catchy love that theme song every time i watch the film i end up humming the theme for days the best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib really overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day i give it 7 out of 10 br br doc savage doc savage thank the lord he's here
<START> the dentist starts on the morning of dr alan feinstone corbin bernsen his wife brooke's linda hoffman wedding anniversary on the surface mr mrs feinstone seem to have a nice life a beautiful home in los angeles he has a successful career with responsibility but beneath things are very wrong alan discovers that brooke is having an affair with matt michael stadvec the swimming pool cleaner to add to his humiliation alan then discovers that matt is also having sex with paula roberts lise simms one of his next door neighbours to top it all off he owes the irs who are breathing down his neck a shed load of money alan starts to lose his mind he convinces himself that everything is decayed rotten just like his patient's teeth it's up to him to fix it that morning at work he begins to take his frustrations anger out on his patients first he injures a young boy named jody brian mclaughlin he sexual assault's a patient named april reign christa sauls after he hallucinates that she is his wife deliberately performs an unnecessary painful procedure on another alan also begins to take drugs as he completely loses it goes homicidal starting with his adulterous wife pool cleaner br br directed by brian yuzna i thought the dentist was a good film tried something a bit different the script by dennis paoli stuart gordon charles finch is more of a psycho thriller than straight slasher which came as a surprise to me as i was expecting the latter it would have been easy to make a teenage slasher film like friday the 13th 1980 with a high body count a wise cracking dentist villain but what the dentist actually turned out to be is very different the dentist is at heart a character study of one mans descent into madness it does a fine job although having said that i'm not sure what he goes through is enough justification for his subsequent murderous actions it moves along at a nice pace has a nice narrative in which i liked the constant connection alan makes between the decay he sees in his patients the decay he sees in the world around him is an entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes it goes without saying that anyone with a phobia about the dentist probably should give this one a miss or you'll never go again i liked the ending too where the tables are turned i'll say no more br br director yuzna does his usual fine job here in fact i don't think i've seen a yuzna film that i didn't enjoy to some extent he obviously predictably takes the opportunity to play on our fear of the dentist with some nice dental torture set pieces including pulling people's teeth out sexually molesting them performing operations on drugs torturing people with the dreaded dentist's drill there are some other gore scenes as well a dead dog someone gorily slashed with a knife cut out tongues yuzna gives the film a certain style on what was probably a low budget he likes to tilt his camera which make for some nice angles i liked the shot where the camera is above someone being knifed huge sprays of blood splatter on the floor in a nice wide overhead angle br br technically the dentist is fine decent cinematography music production values although some of the special make up effects look a little unconvincing the acting is pretty strong from everyone involved with corbin putting in a good crackpot performance the ever cool genre favourite ken foree turns up as detective gibbs one of los angeles finest br br the dentist didn't turn out like i had expected all the better for it if your a horror fan perhaps want something a bit different then this is well worth checking out i liked it think it's definitely worth a watch
<START> another weak third season entry 'is there in truth no beauty ' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as spock would say fascinating the main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane it's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise obviously i think it was a mistake to ever 'show' the alien as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build up all we get is the standard star trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar in any event kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by mr spock and then only if spock is wearing a special visor for the longest time i thought the alien's name was 'carlos ' which i found humorous but i digress spock is required to mind meld with kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the enterprise back to safety this is accomplished but when spock kollos go back to end the mind meld by golly spock forgets his visor uh oh he goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of kollos' assistant a blind woman with psychic powers this might have been a really bizarre excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the series' last season
<START> i saw his movie in dallas texas when it came out in 1986 i remember them giving out prizes for showing up to see the movie after seeing the movie i can see why the movie was not bad nor was it great the problem with this movie was that it tried to tell a side story they created a new story new characters and tried to wrap it around the masters saga my biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of robotech masters attacking the earth they even used the same scenes from the master saga but with different dialogue as a kid i loved the movie but unfortunately i haven't seen it as an adult and can't give a better review looking back i was disappointed but now i would love to see the movie and re evaluate my stance on it that being said will someone please release this movie for the whole world to judge i love robotech and can't wait for the shadows chronicles
<START> having not seen all the films released in 2002 i can't say that this is the best film of the year i can say that it is the best film i have seen all year br br most american films featuring black people either obsess over the american preoccupation with race relations or fall into the cliches of the inner city ghetto with every sterotype imaginable spouting ebonic phrased slang antwone fisher stands proudly alone in this regard race is irrelevant save for one fight that may or may not have been provoked by a racial slur br br antwone fisher's story is one that should find resonance with any empathic individual he is understatedly and thoughtfully portrayed by derek luke denzel washington while obviously using his star power to have the film made sticks to the background for the most part and allows the film to be the antwone fisher story br br at a time when bet and popular culture in general want to maintain the ghetoization of a large number of americans and canadians too you know this is a film that speaks to the humanity in all of us i just hope that the non black audience will go see this film for that humanity rather than avoiding it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the movie whom they can identify with that would be a sad commentary on race relations in north america in and of itself br br
<START> i thank god i didn't go to cinema for this film i would be very sorry for the money i gave i saw it on tv and i couldn't beleive my eyes i wonder if any film could be worse than this one they spent millions of dollars to this film for nothing awful acting and awful scenario i think the other people who wrote comments are the man working from that film company it's very big fiasco in year 2000 can they still laugh at this kind of film embarassing
<START> visitor q is a failed attempt at black comedy which focuses on what might be the world's most dysfunctional family including physical abuse from beatings to murder to incest to sodomy to necrophilia to a lactating mom who nurses her husband and adult daughter etc the film is so outrageous it garnered some critical praise and established a small cult following however with home video quality and a slapdash production visitor q just doesn't hold up even as a curiosity genitals are blurred out and sanitary appliances clearly visible make up is awful and everything else is amateurish at best a waste of time c
<START> i loved this movie it was so well done great acting and drama and historically accurate i love romy schneider movies this one rocks not as great as sissi but still rocks br br and scorpiolina she commented and said french dubbing well this is originally a german movie not french so yea second of all there was a plot maybe your not familiar with history oh and her mother played the part of her governess not her teacher and the storyline was actually not cinderella but queen victoria maybe u missed that detail br br but anyway yea the history in this movie is great i love historical movies and queen victoria is very fascinating i love all the historical stuff like that guy that was trying to manipulate her mom and when she ran away and met her future husband and he showed her the new type of dance waltzing when waltzing was new it was considered kinda scandalous because the couples dance so close yea her governess was like oh my god br br and also the clothes i love the clothes the styles are great hoop skirts are awesome and of course romy always looks very pretty
<START> casting jack cassidy as ken frankin was sheer brilliance cassidy personified arrogance confidence charm and wit all with a condescending evil little smirk on his face in my opinion jack cassidy is by far the best murderer having appeared three times in the columbo series this particular and first performance is my favorite columbo episode ever hands down a fresh faced steven spielberg did amazing camera work yes there were a couple of camera shadows on the actors at times capturing the nuances and banter at different and intriguing angles between columbo and franklin also the panoramic and tight in shots at big bear lake ca franklin's cabin home were very impressive br br if you have not yet seen this episode then you owe it to yourself to do so it's a true masterpiece br br jack cassidy was a very talented actor and singer his charismatic personality was highly infectious his death in 1976 at age 49 was very sad and indeed very tragic he surely had his best years ahead of him rest in peace jack you will live on for eternity through your great work
<START> olivier kosentsev richardson coranado zefferelli and almerayeda have all directed hamlet but branagh's the only one who got it right br br this is the only film of hamlet that contains the full four hours of william shakespeare's masterpiece and gives a unique feel to the whole story br br not many directors could pull this off without boring their audience but branagh's skillful use of bravora film style and stunt casting allows people to see the importance of the scenes that are usually cut out br br examples of this include gerarde depardue as ranyaldo whos entire purpose in the film was to simply say yes my lord as polonius asks him to spy on leartes this also included billy crystal as the grave digger robin williams as osric jack lemmon as marcellous and charlton heston as the actor br br branagh's performance of the act 4 scene 4 soliloquy which again is usually cut out is nothing short of c cinematic marvel as the camera slowly pulls back as the intensity grows it is a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start applauding br br branagh is the only film maker that understood the importance of every scene in this film and knew how to convey that importance to the general audience br br this is a must see for everyone who enjoy's good story telling brilliant acting and incredible direction all of these part of william shakespeares greatest triumph
