<START> this is the prime example of low budget winning over what would be a good story line let's bring back samaire armstrong having seen her work on the o c i know she can do better then find a better script and budget br br the special effects were so bad and mostly badly computer generated that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on screen and samaire armstrong's alert changing into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad gcif figure before she even begins to change final fantasy's humans as well as pixar's made these laughable think of the figure as a nude barbie doll br br the story of was interesting though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new as it also got into the balance between evil maybe not so evil and the possible end of human kind should the two lines mate the subplot of a book of werewolf linage which effected some of the other characters in a spell like manner for a while was effective but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past br br bring in a better script and direction and i'd come back again
<START> i do not envy barry levinson rachel weisz ben stiller or jack black for doing this film it's in one word boring maybe the fact that is too predictable the more than exploited ben stiller's loser role or the not at all funny scenes make this film just something to forget even christopher walken's appearance finishes in a pathetic way i was very disappointed i love ben stiller's acting i loved it in most of his films the last one i saw before this was duplex with drew barrymore and was not that bad about jack black well apart from high fidelity i've never seen him doing something good what about school of rock ooops frightening
<START> i hate this movie i hate the show i hate just about everything about it it's so annoying and stupid everyone's saying that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they're going to make it big what kind of drugs are you taking nat and alex are going to end up as either hobos or end up like jane hudson from whatever happened to baby jane i could only get through not even 20 minutes of this one barely 30 seconds of the show and i managed to survive about half an hour of 'battle of the bands' how anyone could cheer for these guys in the audience at the kid's choice awards i have no clue days before the movie premiere on nick most of the teen girl actresses on nick jamie spears emma roberts lindsey shaw etc showed up in a commercial influencing brain dead kids about how awesome nat and alex wolff are first off they didn t trick me and second of all nat and alex probably either drugged them or payed them loads of money in order to say that and sound convincing because i don't see how anyone could find this show movie entertaining the music is just awful nat's singing sounds like a sick dying moose on crack alex is the most annoying movie tv show character ever he's not funny he's annoying he's really weird and he thinks he's hot and knows everything about girls this guy's lucky if he ever manages to get laid you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters in real life don't even exist the character jesse is actually played by nat and alex's cousin jesse draper they mustve had some budget problem their father is not single he's married to polly draper but she doesn't appear on the show making it seem the wolff's are mom less rosalina doesn't exist either her name is allie dimeco i'll tell ya the naked brothers are gonna be in some deep sh when their fans find out the whole thing is staged 0 10
<START> this movie was disgusting their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage what is garbage the misuse of peoples time the misuse of energy and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write talia you are a sick demented loser your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem br br the acting and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the middle of the garbage i ended up at a scene that was uncalled for if you want to learn how to shock people watch a larry clark movie i lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie no more support from me how could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is manifested from the mind of a psycho i feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene i think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is congratulations you won his attention
<START> although it's not as creepy as it's cult classic predecessor zombi 2 i actually like this one better this is because of it's faster pace better settings and cool 80's soundtrack it's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by lucio fulci the zombies don't quite look as nasty as in zombi 2 but they still look good it was made pretty well but it definitely has it's share of cheesiness for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas some are braindead while others say funny lines but who expects consistency when it comes to italian horror there's even a flying zombie head how rad is that definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans it'd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well also check out zombi 4
<START> the time is the future and for many not aware of it that day is now in this final movie for legendary actor edward g robinson solent green becomes a landmark classic many a film buff and environmentalist believe this is our eventual history the movie is taken from the novel entitled 'make room make room' but who's working title was changed to solent green the story concerns the earth as it evolves into the future with the world's environmental problems becoming nothing short of catastrophic the planet's natural resources have been exhausted and basic food has been reduced to simple staples they come in a variety of colors such as solent yellow solent red and now 'solent green ' however there are those who know the 'real' ingredient in solent green and cringe at their own culpability and fear divine retribution the first is a food executive named william r simonson joseph cotton upon his death a dedicated police detective called robert thorn charleston heston seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide although corruption goes all the way to the top it begins with simonsons' bodyguard tad fielding chuck connors and security chief donnovan roy jenson who target thorn for a waste desposal factory thorn's boss lt hatcher brock peters believes his suspicions but warns him of those 'higher and hot' who want the case closed but thorn will not risk his job for an easy way out what thorn discovers marks him for death but like the film awaits a final warning
<START> most of us at least inhabit two worlds the real world where we are at the mercy of circumstances and the world within the unconscious a safe place where we can escape with those words mr gone introduces inside the world of the maxx a fascinating world where the fantasy and the reality are combined inspired in the comic books of sam kieth the maxx is very faithful to the material in what it was inspired not only in the story but also in the graphic style that look like the pages of the comic giving this show a surreal and unique appearance but also the story it's interesting and entertaining at moments it could turn too weird but when you got inside it it's hard to get out of it the story and the characters are wonderfully developed the music goes perfectly with the style of the show and give it the proper atmosphere unfortunately like many good animated shows this one was short lived the maxx is a must see it 's one of my all time favorites
<START> like so many media experiments this amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary in the 5 years since it was released the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development and i found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason i imagine the director clearly is a fan of hitchcock and it's too bad that the film was not better executed but in fact it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention one can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing page br br i have to admit i found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more sometimes the slick has less to offer us and i would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for education purposes oh yes and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot my heart rate went up and i was reluctant to get up and take a break
<START> amazing performance from simon pegg who just gets better and better with every role as usual he plays the part of a very cringy character who makes you want to hide behind your cushion in embarrassment for him sometimes but thats what pegg is all about br br the laughs were regular and eye watering and everyone of them aimed at penn the movie was very cleverly put together where every character plays a very sophisticated and serious part with penn being the only humour involved which is a huge credit to the director robert weide br br and i cant let this one go without a quick round of applause to gilliam anderson who shone throughout highly recommended to all
<START> he he hello this is a really fun movie basically in party girl you have your fun lovin' independent early 90's new yorker chick along with her party friends she meets a mature turkish vendor it is a comming of age story for those new adults who are searching for what they want to do it is comforting to see a female slacker develop into a mature woman hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only skills are being able to maintain while hammered and a nack for throwing good parties br br on a side note parker posey makes this movie great i have never been a great fan of her but this movie makes me just want to watch all of her movies there are subtle manerisms that perfected her character if you want good laughs and a fun time make sure to watch this movie repeated viewings are a must
<START> for months i've been hearing about this little movie and now i've seen it i find it cute cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people's creative ideas in order to make their own one joke premise of a movie troops swingblade any of the million blair witch parodies come to mind if all that these directors want is a foot inside hollywood's door then they're doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how hollywood makes films how many times have you heard the phrase it's animal house meets back to the future it's wall street meets dead poet's society or shakespeare in love meets star wars i remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable
<START> sandwiched in between san francisco and captains courageous two of spencer tracy's greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people they gave him a gun stars spencer tracy and franchot tone in the only film they ever made together and gladys george as the woman who loves them both br br tracy and tone are a couple of world war i draftees tone is a weak character who almost goes over the hill in boot camp but tracy stops him tracy is still playing the lovable blowhard younger wallace beery type that mgm envisioned for him when they signed him away from fox br br over at the front tone gets an opportunity and takes it when during a fight he manages to get to a church tower that peers down on a german machine gun nest he's learned to shoot by now and he does a sergeant york but alvin c york was never changed by the war the way tone has br br wounded in the fight tone convalesces at a hospital with gladys george looking out for him tracy goes awol himself to visit his pal and he and george get something going later on when tracy is reported missing in action tone and george marry tracy's brokenhearted when he comes back and learns of the marriage but takes sit in stride br br the rest of the film is dealing with tone applying the the wartime skills he's learned to the gangster trade he's a hit man now and george doesn't really know what he does for a living i think you can figure the rest out br br the part of the film that gave me some trouble is that i can't believe gladys george couldn't figure it out she's a street smart girl her part is very much like the one she played in the roaring twenties opposite james cagney br br speaking of the roaring twenties humphrey bogart's character development there is similar to tone's although he was not the central character of the movie in fact there are elements of they gave him a gun that are to be found in taxi driver and in clint eastwood's classic the unforgiven br br the world war i battle sequences are very well staged by director woody van dyke for some reason leonard maltin panned this film i think it's a lot better than he gave it credit
<START> diana guzman is an angry young woman surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas she takes her anger out on the closest targets br br when she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club she knows she's found her home br br the film progresses from there as diana learns the usual coming of age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing michelle rodriguez is very good in the role particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism br br the picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors who pale in comparison to the older more experienced cast there are too many pauses in the script which detracts from the dramatic tension the overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity br br this is a good picture to see once if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power its limitations prevent it from being placed in the see it again and again category
<START> sensitive film does lack brilliance and to some degree narrative structure but is nevertheless superbly shot and performed however the narrative structure point is debatable while it gives the impression of tying off loose ends nicely in the final scenes and connects its thoughts with what might be described by the modern viewer as a story i'm sceptical as to whether this feel needs a narrative structure that is definite and detectable inevitably it will be compared with somersault in that its central protagonist i'm not sure that's the correct word is a young and very young looking woman whose newly discovered sexuality both confuses and empowers her although of course cate shortland's film tackles this aspect better but while the possibility exists for reckless viewers to dismiss this film as a clichÃ© peaches is in some ways much more ambitious than somersault perhaps that's where it doesn't quite make it it's certainly very different to monahan's first feature the interview i'm not quite sure how the sex scenes between weaving and lung added to the story who knows maybe they did they certainly rammed home the compromised and flawed nature of weaving's character although i personally think this was achieved without the need for these scenes br br just saw the film again br br on a second viewing i can see how some would dismiss it as a telemovie dressed up as a feature but i'm not sure how distinct these 'categories' are anymore or even if we should be making that distinction in any case i do think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from hallmark efforts on the other hand the film's structure is very formal and its content is hardly challenging at least in the way somersault tom white three dollars the illustrated family doctor look both ways and the human touch are the performances are all good but i did come to the realisation that the main reason i was enjoying the film was because it fit the australian genre without necessarily adding anything and i can understand that this can be a fairly good reason for another person not to like it indeed it wasn't until lung enters the room in her vietnamese dress that the film really begins to pack a punch but that leads us into another debate should we expect that a film must challenge us all the time certainly i enjoy being challenged by a film or a book or other people but is there no room anymore for what is simply a nice story br br i haven't deleted my initial post on this film because i'm all too aware of the orwellian overtones of such an act but i would downgrade my initial rating from an 8 to perhaps a 6 5 br br as for nominations for afi best film my votes go to the human touch three dollars and look both ways and i think look both ways should win
<START> another case of a decent dvd case betraying the shot on video quality of the film br br it wasn't that bad rochon does a serviceable job and damn the cast is good looking i've never seen that many musclebound guys hang out together on a regular basis this movie really wanted to make you think rochon was the killer but it was not to be my biggest problem with the film was that by the end i didn't much care who was the killer and the real killer made little sense since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers were thinking 'ha betcha didn't see that one coming sucker ' yeah there were continuity errors about mainly with ms rochon's ever changing wardrobe but for an indie slasher it's not that bad i was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless but that was just a gimmick the dialog was overly think and painful at times br br just don't have high expectations going into this and it won't be that bad and lloyd kaufman's cameo is wonderfully understated
<START> this film was absolutely brilliant every performance in this film is excellent especially jake gyllenhaal and chris cooper it looks like mr gyllenhaal will have a huge film career if this is anything to go by i thought that joe johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated woth big budget blockbusters jumanji honey i shrunk the kids he pulls of every scene with sheer class my favourite scene was where homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky going down as all of his dreams were it was beautiful joe johnston should direct more of these brilliant acting driven films as well as his big budget blockbuster faire which is also excellent kudos to all involved in this masterpiece
<START> hilarious film i saw this film at the 2002 sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival and laughed from start to finish the acting was subtle but very funny i'm not entirely certain about the real world influence we don't get that here but the film holds up without the understanding of that show heather b steals every scene she appears in most notably when acting with her seldom talkative red co star highly recommended i'd love to see this released on video dvd some time in the future
<START> a convict serving time comes forward to give the cold case unit information about the murder of a policeman committed years before the murder of sean cooper a good cop was never solved naturally the detectives believe the new evidence will help them put together all the pieces of the puzzle that frustrated their colleagues br br in flashbacks we are taken to the baptism of james bruno's baby sean and jimmy were partners there is tension as sean who is the godfather arrives disheveled and late for the rite eileen bruno doesn't appear to be happy being there the real mystery is revealed by her she caught sean who was drinking with jimmy in the backyard kiss her husband and more shocking yet jimmy responding willingly br br somehow at the station the partners become the center of gossip sean has not endeared himself to his superior because he discovered the involvement with a criminal in his area who controlled the drug business sean realizes this man is in with the drug strong man because he always makes an excuse to free the scum bags sean and jimmy haul into the station all the time the pressure is too much on jimmy sean is comfortable in his homosexuality and wants to be honest about it cooper's own father doesn't want anything to do with a queer son even his superior mccree wants him out of his jurisdiction but the case is complicated because cooper comes from a long line of irish men serving in the police force sean is killed because his homosexual condition and for knowing too much on his peers' involvement in taking dirty money br br tom petit wrote this honest portrayal of the life of a police officer in the closet and his secret love with another fellow cop we thought it was a frank account of a serious matter no one talked about in those days sometimes the people involved with the show fearing reprisals from sponsors or the networks don't dare to present these real situations jeannot szwarc shows a sensitive approach to this thorny issue which is dealt without the sensationalism the case might have been shown with a different team br br there is a rare chad everett appearance as the older jimmy bruno his take is right on target with a touch of sentimentality that doesn't get out of hand shane johnson makes an excellent contribution to the show as sean cooper the cast is marvelous and it includes good all around performances from everyone under mr szwarc's direction br br in this episode nick vera gets closer to his neighbor the mother of the basketball player the detective took his ball away nick is heading for romance with the woman
<START> in this forgettable trifle the 40 ish norma shearer plays a fluttery girlish socialite in monte carlo caught in a tussle between george sanders and robert taylor it would be tempting to blame this movie's failure on the dull talky script or director george cukor who never seems interested in livening up the film's generally comatose state mostly though it's the fault of shearer herself who desperately wanted to keep playing young parts as long as she could get away with it inadvertently this makes her cardboard lover a bizarre monument to an aging woman's vanity
<START> nathan detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in nyc but the heat is on and he can't find a secure location he bets chronic gambler sky masterson that sky can't make a prim missionary sarah brown go out to dinner with him sky takes up the challenge but both men have some surprises in store Â br br this is one of those expensive fifties mgm musicals in splashy colour with big sets loud music larger than life roles and performances to match broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing which i don't my main problem with these type of movies is simply the music i like all kinds of music from albinoni to zz top but broadway show tunes in swing time with never ending pah pah tah dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren't my cup of tea this was written by the tag team of frank loesser mankiewicz jo swerling and abe burrows based on a couple of damon runyon stories and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak blaine's two numbers for example are identical unnecessary don't advance the plot and grate on the ears and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you there are only two memorable tunes luck be a lady sung by brando not sinatra as you might expect and sit down you're rockin' the boat nicely performed by kaye but you have to sit through two hours to get to them the movie's trump card is a young brando giving a thoughtful laid back performance he also sings quite well and even dances a little and is evenly matched with the always interesting simmons the sequence where the two of them escape to havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise bustle and vowel murdering of noo yawk fans of musicals may dig this but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show
