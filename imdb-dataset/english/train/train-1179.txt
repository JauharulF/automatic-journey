<START> i've seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time this one however takes the cake more comedy than horror full moon high puts the c in cheese fest the star quality in this movie is not bad just the way it was made just sends in rolling downhill adam arkin plays tony an all american high school football player of the 50's who ends up not aging due to a werewolf bite in transylvania the most annoying part of the movie was the violin player he drove everyone batty ed mcmahon plays his ultra conservative father who met his end of his own bullet adam's father alan plays a shrink who seems to be not top of his game after all these years tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack and then he'll get the chance to catch in his state more laugh than blood shed this movie is just a start in the 80's teen wolf was an improvement from this 1 out of 5 stars
<START> this movie was excellent a bit scary but excellent at that for those of you that have heard of columbine and know the story it gives you a idea of what and why these kids did what they did in the back of your mind you know that people think of this stuff but you never realize just how bad it is and this movie makes you realize it's seriously that good it also makes you think twice before you make fun of someone that's for sure i read a book on the columbine massacre and it made me think this movie makes me worry and scares me to death on the downside it's like a how to kill someone guide for serial killers i recently received a threat and i blew it off thinking nothing of it but after this movie i think you should take everything seriously some people are crazy and you never truly know which they are so take it seriously and don't under estimate someone
<START> feeding the masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard earned dollars suggestion keep your hard earned dollars and let's just say that good old theatrex took one for the team on this one guess what the plots about zombies taking over this time though for the sake of originality this film takes place in rhode island and to be honest i'm not sure i've ever seen a zombie flick based in rhode island a tv station controlled by the government is supposedly keeping up normal broadcasts so that any remaining citizens won't think that there's any problem in the world that is those that never look or go outside anyway i will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film there is actually somewhat of a story to this but i'm not bothering with that because after a while you'll either not care or have fallen asleep at any rate this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the seen it all before stuff that gets trotted out before the camera trust me you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch this 3 out of 10
<START> this was a real guilt pleasure i saw the trailer and all the advertising so i figured 'why not check out this vh1 movie ' and as they used to say on t v 'i can't believe i watched the whole thing ' quinn and harris were believable beatle boys and although the accents were sort of over the top and difficult to decipher at times i found the dialogue believable as well the film touched upon the tenuous relationship of len mc and showed how deep down they were simply two guys who grew up close together and shared a passion for music coming at it though with different sets of issues and personal needs you find yourself wishing they'd hopped in the cab to snl for an impromptu reunion that would have knocked the world's socks off but you also gain a greater appreciation for why they didn't
<START> not only does this movie have a poor plot bad direction and terrible acting its opens up a whole new meaning to racism br br in this film white chicks are the sluts white boys are the wana be gangsters and successful yes again white businessmen are revolting toilet shitters br br i just wonder what would happen if i made the exact same movie with the exact same story line and script only i made it about caucasians he dude its good to finally see your've stopped dating those black chicks br br nobody seems to notice it but watch this film again and you'll vomit at how they have portrayed the new zealand white boys all of a sudden its white folks who are the main cause of gang aggression and whores out for a quick bang only samoans girls have a heart there's no such thing as a non slutty white girl br br it disgusts me that they couldn't make this film without giving the caucasian community in new zealand a repulsive profile if you think i'm overgeneralizing go watch this film and see what you make of the white boys just because samoans choose to call us white boys in actual life doesn't mean its funny if i said hey black boy i'll loose my teeth br br don't see this movie don't waste your money don't be racist
<START> i am an avid fan of violent exploitation cinema who would never attack a film for being violent or disturbing i consider cannibal holocaust a masterpiece and will always defend controversial films like day of the woman or last house on the left as genuine classics anyone who browses through my other user comments will notice that i am actually very pro violence gore when it comes to films however i do think that there should be at least some point to the violence this piece of crap doesn't have any point whatsoever the first film in the notorious guinea pig series the devil's experiment 1985 is widely controversial but as opposed to many other controversial films this stinker has nothing at all to be recommended for i must say that before seeing any of the guniea pig films i already had a feeling that i would hate this one knowing what it was about due to its status as one of the most controversial films around however i decided i had to see it i am very glad i didn't waste any money on this pile of crap and i sure wish i hadn't wasted my time with it either br br this thing's story i don't even want to call it a 'film' it doesn't have one three scumbags torture a woman to death for some excruciating 40 minutes that's it there is no artistic value no 'shocking' story no suspense nothing simply the disbelief that a film that shows nothing except for a woman being tortured for no reason enjoys an enormous cult following it is disturbing i give it that of course it is disturbing to watch a torture video for 40 minutes what is more disturbing however is the fact that many people actually seem to regard this pile of garbage as some kind of masterpiece i really cannot figure why the fact that the gore effects look realistic cannot be the reason i hope the girl who plays the victim isn't a very good actor and reacts very calm to all the torture that makes the film look less realistic which is in this single case a good thing this is a film that is sickening not for its gore but for its redundancy its existence for the sole purpose of showing 40 minutes of torture br br i strongly oppose any form of censorship since this is 100 fake and nobody got hurt during its production it is legitimate to make such a film however i cannot think of a single reason why anyone would like this other than the morbid desire to watch suffering and the enjoyment of torture this film's sequel flowers of flesh and blood gained notoriety when actor charlie sheen mistook it for an actual snuff film and informed the fbi fortuneately the film turned out to be fake overall the devil's experiment is a fake torture snuff film that seems to have the sole purpose of looking as close to a real snuff film as possible br br the devil's experiment is one of the worst films i have ever had the misfortune of sitting through don't torture yourself by giving this piece of crap a try for its controversial status do yourself a favor and avoid it zero stars out of 10 i wish there was a negative scale in order to appropriately rate this pile of crap
<START> having seen three other versions of the same film i am afraid for me this is by far the weakest primarily due to scott's rather dull and leaden performance his emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film alistair sim portrayed the role infinitely better when scrooge was at his meanest you don't get the sense scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing i cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the alistair sim version even the musical version and frankly the muppets take on this are better executed very disappointing
<START> i saw the the bourne ultimatum last summer with a friend and wow i had already seen the first two films and i liked them but ultimatum i loved br br matt damon plays jason bourne a amnesia suffering cia agent on the run trying to discover who he is br br like i already said i loved this movie from start to finish no plot holes slow scenes everything was paced just right and it fit in well with the other films but in all senses it was much better br br best stunts car chases actors and effects i've seen in an action movie all summer surprisingly due to spider man 3 pirates etc but i it wasn't just action in this film jason doesn't just kill and run he has a soul and the audience feels for him so drama is included but that doesn't slow it down br br of all the threequels that came out last summer this was the best
<START> october sky is a highly lauded movie and itÂ¡Â¦s easy to see why the story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs especially jake gyllenhaal and chris cooper the hero finally gets what he wants and itÂ¡Â¦s a true story frankly i think the directorÂ¡Â¦s achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates we donÂ¡Â¦t see any special narrative or cinematography the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters we feel homerÂ¡Â¦s desire to earn his fatherÂ¡Â¦s recognition and create his own future and his resilience wins our respect Â¡Â§october skyÂ¡Â¨ reminds me of a later 2001 japanese production of mini series Â¡Â§rocket boy Â¡Â¨ which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison when october sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny Â¡Â§rocket boyÂ¡Â¨ offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society starring the outstanding actor yuji oda Â¡Â§rocket boyÂ¡Â¨ focuses on three men as ordinary as can be a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother like what homer feels in his family and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea the collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them Â¡Â§impossible Â¡Â¨ to compensate for his lost ideal kobayashi yuji works in the tour operator because itÂ¡Â¦s called Â¡Â§galaxy Â¡Â¨ when his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him he finally finds strength from his fatherÂ¡Â¦s words who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed Â¡Â§but i donÂ¡Â¦t regret it Â¡Â¨ his father told kobayashi Â¡Â§at least i tried Â¡Â¨ it is his fatherÂ¡Â¦s confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair kobayashiÂ¡Â¦s effort finally fails and he goes back to the travel agency but his Â¡Â§crazyÂ¡Â¨ courage inspires his friends and everyone loves him more just before the end of the series kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts after the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says Â¡Â§astronauts wanted for 2004 Â¡Â¨ kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs just like a kid looking at his ticket to disneyland kobayashi may never get what he wants but he dares his destiny and Â¡Â§just does it Â¡Â¨ this series is so heart gripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy unlike dilbert or other sarcastic writings this show enlightens us and teaches us something homer and kobayashi both have the dream and they do what they can despite other peopleÂ¡Â¦s opinions i recommend other imdb users to see the japanese tv series if you are a nine to fiver you will feel more touched i feel sorry that imdb doesnÂ¡Â¦t have its data maybe you can ask somebody from japan to help you
<START> as a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period it's almost a must see and rates a 9 as a variety show i was drawn to watch this by the presence of richard captain midnight webb who plays the colonel in charge of the event what surprised me was the stunning performance of doris day outside of 'calamity jane' i've never seen her put over a song better than she does here randolph scott is memorable as well even if he doesn't see much screen time it's been a while since i saw the movie but i was almost sure humphrey bogart put in an appearance with so many familiar faces it's hard to keep track if it ever turns up on a tv station near you be sure to catch the doris day sequence if nothing else br br
<START> i saw this on tv the other nightÂ or rather i flicked over to another channel every so often to watch infomercials when i couldn't stand watching it any longer it was bad really really bad not so bad it's good just flat out bad how did it get funded who thought this was a good idea an actor friend of mine auditioned and was told he wasn't good enough to play a bad guy but i think what they meant was save yourself and runaway from this steaming pile of i bet the rest of the cast had been given the option to be fair the acting was hard to judge because of the appalling fake american ascents the shooting was dullllllllllll the action was awkward and stilted the dialog was inane by far the saddest thing was ship in real life the interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on film it doesn't scrub up well instead of trying very unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crews liner with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusting polls i kid you not they could have change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness dumb dumb dumb don't watch this movie not even as a joke
<START> citizen x tells the story of the butcher of rostov nickname for a heinous and perverse russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives from 1978 92 the film focuses on the novice detective rea who doggedly pursued the killer against all odds in the face of an uncooperative bureaucracy in self serving and convenient denial an hbo product for t v the film offers a solid cast good performances spares the audience much of the grisly details but plays out like a docudrama sans the stylistics of similar hollywood fare an even and straight forward dramatization of a serious and comparatively little known story more interesting than jack the ripper b
<START> fever pitch isn't a bad film it's a terrible film br br is it possible american movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that hollywood churns out that they'll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs that's the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy and i use that term loosely because there's nothing funny in this film is getting good reviews br br i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny br br the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film he adapted fever pitch for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in 1997 peter hedges found hornby's voice for about a boy 2002 and when high fidelity was americanized for a movie in 2000 writers d v devincentis steve pink john cusack and scott rosenberg didn't go wrong because they kept the essence of hornby's wit and humor they made one of the best films of that year br br so why does the american version of fever pitch go so painfully awry the british version wasn't a masterpiece but it was charming funny unexpected and gave us two characters we could like respect and understand br br but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornby's work in americanizing the story they've butchered it removing all that was good and unique about hornby's work and replacing it with conventional drivel br br they've transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy never once veering from the wretched formula lindsey drew barrymore has three girlfriends each of whom has a distinct function one's overweight the second's cynical and ambitious and the third's a romantic want to guess how many male friends ben jimmy fallon has br br what made high fidelity such fun was not only a good leading man and lady but engaging supporting characters in this fever pitch the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny they're so insignificant they're not even decorative the only reason they're in the film is because the formula demands it poor ione skye winds up as one lindsey's pals in a thankless role the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away come to think of it cusack would've made an excellent ben of course cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script br br there isn't a single solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced every plot turn is predictable every lame joke telegraphed ganz and mandel labor for laughs the first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch it's almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing guru's formula pasted on the wall when they got to a certain page they looked up at the formula and said ok the guru says this has to happen now and presto br br directors bobby and peter farrelly don't help the film any they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters they hand over the v o narration not to the protagonist but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park thanks to some extremely clunky writing we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings br br barrymore does cute and adorable better than most she's as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday but even her cuteness can't save this extraordinarily awful film she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story about 30 minutes into the film lindsey tells ben you're funny the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script for fallon's ben never says anything even remotely funny fallon is neither witty nor funny when he does comedy he overacts br br fallon was never any good on saturday night live he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices the only reason weekend update worked occasionally was because fallon's cohort tina fey knows a thing or two about comedy br br actors who think they're funny and behave that way rarely if ever are actually funny that's true of fallon he thinks he's hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle his stuttering unsure of himself shtick didn't work on the small screen it's lousier on the big screen br br unfortunately for fallon his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments if you thought his comedy was bad wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff two scenes in particular the first in a park the second in front of ben's school are painful to watch the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work his range of emotions doesn't even run the gamut from a to b br br ben has no personality or depth often he comes across as an oaf and not a lovable one at that it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him compare fallon's performance to firth's in the british version and you'll understand how terribly flat unfunny and forced fallon's ben is and how wrong he is for this role watching fallon in fever pitch makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcher br br just as high fidelity did an americanized fever pitch could've worked brilliantly it just needed better writers more competent directors and most definitely a stronger funnier smarter leading man do yourself a huge favor avoid this rotten film rent the 1997 british version and read hornby's book instead
<START> the van is a simple teensploitation picture made especially for the drive in that goes out of it's way to make you feel comfortable providing many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends danny devito has a small yet plentiful role as the manager of a car wash and almost steals the show all the leads are well acted the characters complex and the directing quite competent for this type of picture a crown international release
<START> the movie has the longest most tortured and agonized ending of any movie i've seen in a long time unfortunately it starts right after the opening credits january jones gives such a wooden performance i was surprised she didn't go up in flames when she got near the candles in the film i don't really remember her from the other films she's done a blessing i have to believe i never criticize an actors performance because in film there are too many things which can affect it but in this case it is so bad that it actually stands out from the atrocious script granted she's given lines and situations meryl streep would have trouble with but i swear at times shes reading from a cue card off set at other times i thought she might actually be learning disabled or slow in some way for real the plot dialog and pacing are as bad as you'll ever see but there is still no excuse for this performance nor for the director that let it be perpetrated i feel sorry for the other actors cruel intentions 10 little indians breakfast club shoved into a rotten burrito then regurgitated by a grade school writer director take that back this has studio exec crayola all over it
<START> seriously crappy movie br br first off the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse furniture store the bad cop takes a girl which they had pulled over into the warehouse's attic while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there the bad cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag and the newbie cop doesn't think there are any problems but he still wonders what was in the bag so he asks gets a bullshit response and then he thinks everything is ok for now br br the bad cop repeats this process and even once with a tit scene made it slightly better but eventually people start to catch on which took awhile considering how f ing obvious it was one girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies like ya do now the bad cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch and then he gets rid of the duffel bagged body br br since she had the oogey boogey magic put on her she comes back with lots of eye shadow on which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie also the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become eye shadow monsters some of the girls meet up with a dude who is apparently a currency specialist and he offers them a ride they look normal to him apparently but when the girls see other people such as the one girls husband he freaks out because she is hideous some people freak out but others don't even notice massive plot hole br br so to wrap it up the eye shadow monsters kill the bad cop who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene it was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping
<START> i really have problems rating this movie it is directed brilliantly there is obviously a lot of money in it gere and danes are intense although her screen personality could use a bit more defining and spicing up editing and cinematography are excellent on the other hand it is one of those really really sick movies where one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes and yes one cannot help but wonder how many copycats will such a movie inspire br br in purely artistic terms it is a 9 but i really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie
<START> this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see i was talked into it and dragged into the theater but boy am i glad for that i thought it was going to be just another love story but it turns out to be sooo much more than that definatly an intellectual flick one of those movies you have to pay attention to
<START> shower is an story about loyalty about the unstoppable advance of modern world in the detriment of rather traditional and more human ways of life a man forced to choose between his successful career in business his big city life his wife and his retarded young brother the eternal doubt between what we want to do and what we should do the modern china versus the ancient one the public baths with its gatherings its cricket fights versus the shopping centres and the skyscraper lots of old men and women that are no longer needed china one country two systems as xiao ping said though one of them is killing the other br br tender moving full of funny moments and of bitter sweet ones the sensitive ones will cry and laugh equally the actors are enormous especially the one who performs the role of the retarded boy and yang zhang makes a good job easy simple letting the story just flow by itself br br my rate 8 10
<START> i won't spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment i just want to add it because all the comments were so positive i felt like i just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma some scenes seemed promising playing with visual dimensions but couldn't hold up the rest i felt like i was stoned for the first time again having semi philosophical conversations with fellow adolescents br br what a futile attempt to raise dutch cinema to new heights i'd rather watch jesus is een palestijn without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves br br gert de graff is not jean luc godard or tarkovsky and appearantly never will be
