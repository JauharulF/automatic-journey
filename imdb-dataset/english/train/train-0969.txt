<START> the film concerns a classic theme in fact it concerns the theme exploited by batman from beginning to end but in real data and details the mayor of new york appreciated and very diligent and dynamic in order to get some project through slightly faster than normal yields to some pressure from some private business contractors about a criminal drug dealer who should have been sent and kept in prison and he pressurizes the judge in his turn to set him free on probation in spite of a negative probation report that disappears but is not destroyed be it only because of the political value it represents and what was to happen happens and a few people including a black schoolboy is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that criminal the city may explode because of it racial tension because of the black school boy and social tension because of the insecurity such criminals free to roam around and go on with their criminal activities represent to the public unluckily the film does not show that tension very well and follows the investigation of the first deputy mayor who wants to find out the truth and does find it out but along the way a few witnesses are killed and those who had played some role in the whole business are forced to retire the judge to end their career and life the contractor or the contractor's go between a public officer who was ready to deliver the disappeared probation report and some shady character after he provides some crucial information the mayor himself retires and takes a long vacation but the main interest of the film is in the exploration of the contortions the mayor is doing to cover up the problem and the contortions he remembers having done in the past that led to the mistake about this probation case the political philosophy that nothing is pure white or pure black and that everything is grey which is never comfortable to decision makers is invoked as an excuse for wrong but profitable decisions we are not speaking of necessary compromises to get to some consensus in some domains that are crucial to public interest we are speaking of considering as less important to take a bad decision about some petty or supposedly petty criminal than some infrastructure or economic project in the city that is not typical of new york that is true in any mayoral office it is just more significant in quantity and in quality in a big metropolitan area like new york and of course in a city or country where police departments are municipal and are controlled by political imperatives the young deputy mayor is thus pushing the old mayor out of the way and he derails his ambition to be the governor of new york in order to become the president of the us the mayor is perfect due to the embodiment al pacino offers us since he is able to express ten minutes of dialogue with one facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless i find the end slightly mushy with the ex deputy mayor campaigning in his own name that seems to mean that he was so attached to justice because he saw his chance to push the mayor out of his own way hence he is not better than all the others just still too young in his ambition br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
<START> one of the great mysteries of life suffered from daily is why nice girls so often are more interested in the jerks and heels than in the nice guys br br worse when the nice guys even want to marry those girls the girls still prefer the jerks and heels even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt have shown they're just interested in using the girls br br stu erwin is the nice guy who continues to be nice after being lied to and cheated and even after losing the girl completely br br clark gable is the jerk and he is perfect in the role rather a sad note to his fans br br jean harlow comes across as a more slender mae west even sounding like la west in some of her cynical throwaway lines br br somewhat puzzling is that so many of the other characters intended to be bad guys i mean heck they're locked up so they must be are so obviously nice people br br in fact there are lots of nice people here people who in a lesser film or story would be snarling and back stabbing but here go out of their way to help someone else br br so maybe the story is rather clichÃ©d at least by modern standards but ultimately the viewer will be glad to have watched br br the biggest complaint i have is that so many really good actors are not given credit once again we can say a fervent thank you to imdb com
<START> it's amazing that actress p j soles didn't become a big star after playing riff randall 1 fan of the punk rock group the ramones in rock 'n' roll high school soles is so exuberant you don't mind she's obviously too old to still be in high school that fact is leveled out by having all the kids look 24 the movie is a fast paced frolic that doesn't cop out everything gets blown to smithereens at the end and that's just as it should be mary woronov an innately kinky and funny presence as the nazi like principal gets a great one of a kind bit at the beginning where frisbees fly dangerously close to her head how many takes did they use on that or was it a fluke and dey young is very appealing as soles' best kate rambeau the weakest link ironically enough in this high school chain gang is the ramones they can't act they're not funny and their concert segment goes on too long one ramones song i want you around is treated as a fantasy and is well captured other incidental songs are good particularly a rare paul mccartney ballad heard near the beginning did we meet somewhere before great fun from
<START> mirror mirror 1990 is a flat out lame movie why did i watch movies like this when i was younger who knows maybe i was one for punishing myself by watching one terrible movie after another i don't know i guess i needed a hobby during my teen years a teenage outcast rainbow harvest seeks solace in an old mirror soon she learns about the horrific power this antique mirror has and uses it to strike out against those who have wronged her movies like these the power giver has a nasty side effect this one changes her inside and out if she likes it or not br br a mess of a movie that for some reason was restored on d v d a few years back i don't know why they should have left it on the shelf and collect dust people love this movie foe some reason if you do i would like to know why until then i dislike this movie and i have no reason to ever watch it again br br not recommended at all
<START> i'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars br br but they just don't understand the movie br br the story is about growing up in a difficult situation br br there is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren br br and there's good reason why so many critics like this movie br br and the reason is because they understand the movie br br i feel sorry for the low scores given by some people br br i wish i could just write a brief summary of a movie but imdb requires you to write 10 lines br br i frankly don't have anything else to say
<START> definitely definitely the worst film i've ever seen no questions asked contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others since it's an independent low budget film but c'mon already Â the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying br br agreeing with everything that has been said about this film for example the mind numbingly weak acting when it's this bad you take another go at shooting the scene god damn it the thing i found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script assuming such a thing existed during the production there was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any rationality or even brains five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath Â gang up on her why don't you br br the only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it which is as the rest of the film a good idea executed exponentially dreadfully br br Âoh and by the way this movie is nothing like the blair witch project or cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand held camera Â this is an effect and not a trait used cleverly it can be breathtaking but in this case it's an excuse for inadequate cinematography
<START> i have to admit that for the first half hour or so of this movie i was basically lost there had been some mildly amusing humour but at best a barebones plot and a general sense of pointlessness that was on the verge of making me think that i was wasting my time then for no apparent reason i suddenly realized that i was enjoying this there was no blinding moment of realization and no suddenly dramatic scene that grabbed me in fact nothing very exciting happens in the entire movie it was as if i just all of a sudden realized that the movie was meant to be largely pointless and that in its very pointlessness was its charm br br morgan freeman starred as an unnamed actor who finds a âlittle projectâ to jumpstart his career he's going to play a supermarket manager and spends the day in a neighbourhood supermarket to research the role while there he meets and bonds with scarlet played by paz vega a cashier who wants more out of life he helps her prepare for a job interview as if she's auditioning for a role while she introduces him to real life it's truly funny watching âhimâ for that's how the character is identified in the credits be overwhelmed by a visit to the local target store br br freeman and vega were great together with a strange but completely believable sort of combined romantic but father daughter chemistry if you feel lost at the beginning stick with this in the end it turns out to be a delightfully charming movie 7 10
<START> this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen i remember watching it years ago when it initially came out on video and for some strange reason i thought i enjoyed it so like an idiot i ran out to purchase the dvd once it was released what a tragic mistake i won't even bother to go into the plot because it is so transparent that you can see right through it anyhow i am a fan of herschell gordon lewis so i am accustomed to cheesy gore effects and bad acting but these people take this to a whole different level it is almost as if they are intentionally trying to make the worst movie humanly possible if that was their goal they suceeded if they intended to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way shape or form that it is real then they failed miserably avoid this movie read the plot synopsis and you've seen it
<START> higher learning says its ok for blacks to torment white people because they're all oppressors most blacks in this movie are portrayed as ignorant savages stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race incompetent acting direction and production values all contribute to this toothache of a flick an appalling piece of trash the perpetrators of this dreck should be ashamed higher learning says its ok for blacks to torment white people because they're all oppressors most blacks in this movie are portrayed as ignorant savages stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race incompetent acting direction and production values all contribute to this toothache of a flick an appalling piece of trash the perpetrators of this dreck should be ashamed
<START> a magical journey concocted by alexander korda and michael powell these two titans of the british cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece some of the most ravishing early technicolor a sublime and shimmering miklos rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of sabu the theatrical and malevolent villainy of conrad veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of june duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well miles malleson who plays duprez father the sultan of basra also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose don't miss this one since posting the above comments i have obtained the recently released dvd and can honestly say i'd never seen the picture properly until viewing this dvd version the clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that i was stunned this amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer again a must see
<START> as a fan of notorious b i g i was looking forward to this movie i am unfortunate to see it is a terrible movie jamal woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray notorious b i g a lot of the story follows notorious b i g 's real son christopher jordan wallace as notorious b i g as a kid unfortunately he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father derek luke is just as unconvincing as sean puffy combs in a nutshell no one is convincing enough to play their roles here the big problem with this are these are actual people they are playing it was boring and did not give any information about notorious b i g that fans and non fans alike did not already know i was especially disappointed with angela bassett a very good actress wasted here as voletta wallace the movie slugs and slugs along thinking that notorious b i g fans will spend tons of money on it i am unfortunate to say that that happened it's nowhere close to a good movie i was expecting so much out of it but unfortunately i didn't get anything i wanted from this i think you should definitely skip this one
<START> this movie shows life in northern cameroon from the perspective of a young french girl france dalens whose father is an official for the colonial french government and whose family is one of the few white families around it gives a sense of what life was like both for the colonists and for the natives with whom they associated it's a sense consistent with another movie i've seen about africa in a similar time period nirgendwo in afrika 2001 but i have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is it's not just an impression things do happen in the movie but the plot is understated the viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the filmmakers' forced upon him although the framing of the story as a flashback from the woman's visit to south western cameroon as an adult provides some perspective
<START> i have been an environmentalist for years and was really looking forward to this show i had it set to record all episodes because i thought i could really learn some great new things i probably could if i could get past rachelle br br i'm sure a lot of this is staged to seem like a reality show and appeal to that class of viewer it doesn't work for someone who's really interested in improving the planet br br this show should be called nagging with rachelle br br since ed is such a great font of information maybe a second show that's really serious about the environment would be a good idea dumbing things down is not necessary for some of us br br i no longer record episodes or watch the show but do let me know if a real green show may be in the works
<START> skip mccoy is a three time loser pick pocket unable to curb his instincts back on the street he picks the purse of candy on a subway train what he doesn't realise is that candy is carrying top secret microfilm microfilm that is of high interest to many many organisations br br director samuel fuller has crafted an exceptional drama set amongst the seedy underworld of new york city communist spies and shady government operatives all blend together to make pickup on south street a riveting viewing from first minute to the last based around a dwight taylor story called blaze of glory fuller enthused this adaptation with heavy set political agenda something that many at the time felt was over done but to only focus on its anti communist leanings is doing it a big disservice br br digging a little deeper and you find characters as intriguing as any that fuller has directed the main protagonist for one is the hero of the piece a crook and a shallow human being his heroics are not born out of love for his country they are born out of his sheer stubborn streak it's quite an achievement that fuller has crafted one of the best anti heroes of the 50s and i'm sure he was most grateful to the performance of richard widmark as mccoy all grin and icy cold heart his interplay with the wonderful jean peters as candy is excellent and is the films heart however it is the oscar nominated thelma ritter who takes the acting honours her moe is strong and as seedy as the surrounding characters but there is a tired warmth to her that ritter conveys majestically br br it's a b movie in texture but an a film in execution pickup on south street is a real classy and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director 9 10
<START> sucks that's all i got to say about this sorry excuse for a film sucks sucks sucks i mean what the hell were they thinking the idiots involved should never be allowed to make another films the acting was so bad that it even failed to entertain on a bad level the attempt at a lesbian scene was sad i felt so bad for the ladies involved this movie sucks sucks sucks br br i heard rumors of a sequel br br god br br help br br us br br all
<START> from the excellent acting of an extremely impressive cast to the intelligently written and very quotable script from the lavish cinematography to the beautiful music score by carter burwell rob roy offers a rarity in movie going experiences one that is nigh impossible to find fault with in any area br br there have been several comparisons made with braveheart which came out the same year with all due credit to mel gibson braveheart struck me as too much of a self conscious and preachy epic to rival rob roy as the kind of movie i would care to see more than once while braveheart works hard to be a serious epic rob roy just grabs you and absorbs you into its tightly edited storytelling not a single scene is wasted br br rob roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic tension action and even occasional humor the characters are well fleshed out perfectly conveying vernacular and mannerisms that anchor them in their authentic period setting br br further they are not caricatures of good and evil as we all too often observe in even modern film br br for example while we hope the heroic rob roy prevails we realize his predicaments are products of his own pride and sense of honor tim roth plays one of the most hateful bad guys in the history of cinema yet there are moments when we can understand how the events of his life have shaped him into becoming what he is rob roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and gripping br br rob roy is a delightful treasure featuring one of the greatest sword fights ever choreographed and a climatic ending worthy of all the tense anticipation
<START> the movie actually has a fairly good story but gets bogged down in several key places it's almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film dennis quaid does a fairly decent job in his role but something is clearly missing from several key scenes br br this 2 5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie and probably would have been a much better film had it not had the feel as if it was thrown together br br
<START> if you were a director that was looking to cast female victims for a slasher movie then surely it would make sense to add a couple of porn stars it's not as if they're inexperienced in front of the camera they have no qualms with the requisite nudity and how many unattractive porn queens can you name christian viel obviously recognized the potential of mixing hardcore actresses with hard gore effects and so he cast four of adult cinema's sexiest and most notorious stars jenna jameson chasey lain ginger lynn allen and taylor hayes all turn up for cameos in arguably the most intriguing slasher flick to be released since scream reinvigorated the genre br br samhain was originally intended for a cinema release in october 2002 thus keeping in check with the halloween based synopsis unfortunately the shoot was plagued by numerous problems which have thus prevented the feature from achieving the exposure that it deserves last i heard it had been signed by film 2000 here in the uk and was penned for a late october release direct to dvd unfortunately that label has got a peerlessly abysmal track record with dtv slashers not content with polluting our shelves with camp blood and its follow up they were also responsible for unleashing granny bleed and the rancid paranoid could samhain finally be worthwhile ammunition to their contemptible catalogue cannon br br five canadian american students and their teacher head to southern ireland as part of their history course upon arrival they are told the legend of a cannibalistic clan that roamed the hills of scotland and murdered locals for food the cannibals were eventually caught and burnt at the stake but it's rumored that one of the tribe escaped and headed to the woodland of ireland to find refuge after the kids have settled and begun doing what all massacre fodder does in these flicks the mandatory goody two shoes and definite heroine candidate begins to be spooked by a shadow creeping around late at night could it be that the flesh hungry maniac is still at large in the forest well what do you thinkÂ br br it looks as if samhain's production was jinxed right from the start almost immediately wallmart refused to develop jenna jameson's nude make up shots and chasey lain began acting characteristically like a drugged out primadonna finally to add insult to injury the producers got cold feet just before the flick was about to hit shelves and began talking of re editing and removing all the gore reports have said that they were unhappy about the copious amounts of violence and they wanted to trim scenes down so it would achieve an r rating veil of course disagreed seeing how his entire synopsis was boosted by its creatively graphic display eventually after months of arguments the director parted company with warehouse productions and the feature was once again locked in the vaults br br despite countless disruptions veil's slasher opus is still one of the best genre pieces to be released since the new millennium the copy i was sent was the pre release screener which was obviously a test press without sound effects or the complete soundtrack but still it boasted a few credible jump scares some superb cinematography and a couple of the goriest set pieces that i've seen for some time one guy is disemboweled via his rectum before being strangled with his own intestine jenna jameson is stripped naked and gutted in unflinching close up and chasey lain ends up 'spilling her guts' after an unfortunate rescue attempt from her boyfriend richard grieco even though the murders are uncommonly gruesome samhain never feels mean spirited which is basically due to the characters being thinly portrayed as basic slasher clichÃ©s in all honesty the script was perhaps the movies biggest downfall because the dialogue was not so much inspired by wes craven's scream movies as it was flagrantly cut and pasted from them br br certainly the inclusion of the mouth watering jenna jameson was a great move by the producers her fans will be excited to know that she does whip off her top as expected and so does chasey lain and taylor hayes but samhain is no soft porn movie and it benefits from sticking to the structure that it set out to produce it's worth noting that the aforementioned xxx stars almost out perform the supposed 'actors' of the feature which isn't much of a complement ginger lynn was at least notable if you ignore the shameful 'oirish accent and her battle with the hulking killer was superbly performed and choreographed by alan chou taylor and jenna delivered expectedly poor dramatics which could have been caused by the numerous problems on set veil's direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed and he provides some much needed injections of suspense exciting and crisp photography is mixed with a good flair for storytelling and the net result is a slasher extravaganza to satisfy even the most critical gore hounds br br it will be interesting to see what kind of final cut is released of samhain rumor has it that a second director was drafted in to shoot a different ending and i'm curious as to how much of the explicit gore will remain intact for worldwide distribution if the end result is only half as good as the rough print that i watched then it's still better than nearly all of the genre pieces that have been unleashed over the past ten years this one is certainly worth checking outÂ
<START> this entry is certainly interesting for series fans like myself but yet it is mostly incomprehensible the plot is confusing as is the sequel continuity some striking effects to be sure but we never find out what it all really means br br try to see the nc 17 workprint version which contains the gore that was cut to be re rated r
<START> normally i'm quite disposed to like low budget gonzo films but darkman iii is so appallingly unengaging that i feel nothing but contempt for it br br it looks and feels like a tv show and a particularly shoddy one at that the sets are sparse the lighting flat the score and effects disjointed and the camerawork is film school 101 there's no plot to speak of the characters are one dimensional and the actors are sleepwalking most of the cast look like they should be doing soft core porn in fact the only reward that i got from this mess was spotting the startling squint faced roxann biggs dawson b'elanna from star trek voyager without her klingon bumpy head makeup on her skin tone is about two shades lighter than it is in voyager either she's been bleached down for this role or blacked up for voyager very strange either way
