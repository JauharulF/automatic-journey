<START> this movie shows us once again how genius the japanese directors are and were this movie could be seen as a sort of a silent movie tetsuo well eisenstein
<START> br br ok well i rented this movie while i was bed ridden hopped up on pain killers and let me say it didn't help the film any br br the film is about a man who buys a car as he is going through a midlife crisis he loves the car more than anything around him one day his wife decides to borrow the car since i don't want to spoil not that there was anything to spoil i shall let your imagination figure out the zany and i use that word lightly antics that follow br br i had to fight to stay awake through this snore a minute sleeper of a film and i would like to say that if you are venturing to the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous please don't it's a waste of the film it was printed on br br then again i could be wrong
<START> this sequel is thoroughly uneven incoherent and rambling in plot if there really is one and tries too damned hard to be modern ridiculous out of period and character 21 st century style songs predominate and cute yawn there are too many manufactured belaboured jokes with animals the actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot even glenn close and she is normally very good sweeps through this film parodying herself as the original de ville and the lead from sunset boulevard it's a film that isn't even good to look at this is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel even basic instinct 2 had a plot characterisation and acceptable acting this doesn't it is bad
<START> this film is amazing and i would recommend to child and adult alike the animation is beautiful the characters are rich and interesting and the story is captivating far better than anything the american studios were producing at the time however there is a couple of caveats to this statement it's a shame that disney bought the studio ghibli back catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it my main point being disney re dubbed the film despite the original english version being very impressive the new cast with van der beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e g pazu and sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers the original music score is also far better than the disney remix it begs the question why did disney make such changes it seems to me is that by having van der beek et al being cast then disney can draw in more money which is fair enough but in the process they tainted they film it is still a beautiful film and i would still recommend it to anyone my main beef is that disney ruined a film from childhood which i loved and still love i am lucky enough to have an original japanese import with the original english dub which i am now going to guard with my life
<START> if this movie proves only one thing it's that keaton is was and always will be a comic at heart even when dodging bullets heading for the electric chair and getting at the wrong end of an information line in prison br br but johnny dangerously goes on to prove even more in the '80s the zaz boys zucker abrahams zucker were the pinnacle in the world of genre spoofs but there were several pretenders to the throne this time amy fast times at ridgement high heckerling tries her hand with an amazing amount of television writers behind the script go and check br br this slap happy slapstick spoof of the 1930's cops and gag sters movies throws just about every cliche for a loop and even adds a few cliches that didn't exist way back when br br and not only is the ever dependable keaton on hand as the johnny of the title but so are such funny guys and dolls as piscopo henner stapleton boyle dunne devito walston and just about every other actor in hollywood that happened to walk into the immediate vicinity you'd be surprised by how many faces you'll recognize i know i was br br and the jokes well when they start out they come at you fast and furious like a machine gun there are too many to count in the beginning topped off with a crazy theme song by weird al yankovic but you have to watch for when they reload and they have to reload a little too often br br everyone tries they seem to be having fun and i was laughing a good amount of the time in the end though there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes could have been funnier not usually the best thing to think about after watching a comedy br br but for a slow night when there's nothing good on tv pop in johnny and be ready for some dangerously serious laughter br br eight stars check out johnny dangerously don't be a bastidge
<START> there is indeed much to complain about this movie version of molnar's mystical play farrell looks good in his title role but his line readings frankly stink this also suffers in large part from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection the sets look phony br br there are two great strengths in this show however although the dialogue readings limp the visual performances are perfect rose hobart as julie is little remembered today mostly for rose hobart in which joseph cornell cut down the programmer east of borneo to simply shots of her credit melford's stylish visual direction of the original her great beauty and simple although stagy performance help repair some of the damage to the earth bound sections of this movie br br however one of borzage's themes is the mystical power of love and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this great from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'the hot place' h b warner's performance here is as always perfect br br so we have here a flawed but very interesting version i think that lang's 1934 version is better as well as the celestial scenes in the henry king version of carousel the watered down musical remake but i still greatly enjoyed this version and think you should give it a chance
<START> this movie is maybe one of the most boring movies of 2000 that i have seen especially the music fails to create suspense when people suddenly disappear also aspects such as martial law are not treated with the necessary seriousness the story itself has problems the un could never take power over the world since the united states alone would not allow it but nations such as china russia japan etc would not either this would also play against someone trying to take over the world as nicolae carpathia does this reminds me of james bond movies only that those have more action naturally the movie is made for christians and only for christians and they may enjoy it since i cannot count myself a christian i find the whole idea ludicrous this prophecy furthermore seems to be if believed to be true dangerously close to other prophecies by cults for the end of the world why fear such a possibility when we can make life as good as possible here on earth without
<START> four prisoners share a single cell the domineering transvestite marcus clovis cornillac marcus's idiot savant buddy paquerette dimitri rataud who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches cockroaches and his little sister lassalle philippe laudenbach the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife and carrÃ¨re gÃ©rald laroche the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping after a brick falls from the wall of the cell the men discover the hidden journal written by a 'fountain of youth' obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s is this journal the secret to their escape or is there something much more sinister behind it br br i was a little weary about getting into this film because the only other experience i have with eric valette was the dreadful one missed call 2008 which i consider to be the worst theatrically released film i've ever seen however much of what was wrong with one missed call could probably be attributed to klavan's awful script because as i remember valette's direction wasn't the worst part about the film unless he chose to include the baby anyway malÃ©fique was a good way to get my respect back it's a french film obviously something i like and it takes place in prison which is my second favourite horror setting after asylums so that's two points for him before the film even starts luckily valette had me once the film ended as well malÃ©fique is a rather deep rather complex rather compelling story of obsession and desperation the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality while it's not a terrifying film in the traditional sense the oddity of its power makes it pretty damn frightening the period between the climax and conclusion was some of the best film i've seen in quite some time and i would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore br br final verdict 8 5 10 quite a bit of respect earned back by valette br br note paramount picked up the rights to make an american remake surprise surprise it's due out in 2009 i'm not sure why to be honest as this doesn't seem like something that would be a big moneymaker here in the states but i've been surprised before br br vive la france br br ap3
<START> this has got to be one of the worst fillums i've ever seen and i've seen a few it is slow boring amateurish not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot the actors do not act i can't blame them they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in summersisle br br there is not one moment in this film that rings true not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved the nicholas cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations i have no doubt that i was seeing a suffering man up there but it was nicholas cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career
<START> having seen triumph of the will i can only say this movie is ghastly even measured against the historically low standards of the time naturally it's all totally fabricated and prejudicial this is what one would expect of 1930's german propaganda unfortunately the quality of the presentation itself is hackneyed and cheap it's also so blatantly ridiculous that even contemporary germans must've left the theater holding their noses in a genre renowned for its base appeal lack of originality and unapologetic wrong headedness this film doesn't even qualify as bad it would have to improve significantly to attain that status
<START> contrary to some people's summaries the women depicted in the film are not geisha they are oiran prostitutes living outside the most famous pleasure districts and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of tokugawa era women i can't say the stories were particularly enlightening but their charm lies in just how typical they are the themes are universal and everyday love friendship and sacrifice br br i did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting i felt like i was getting a glimpse of a time and place i can never otherwise glimpse the actors especially the 4 women who played the main oiran were a thrill to watch i'd only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of japanese culture or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories it's a great example of both
<START> only reason i have seen 101 dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the oscars i must admit that i was less than impressed with this film in this sequel cruella devil by the way glen close pulls off this role very well is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour she likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away from that point we only wait until she starts having crises soon enough she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world of course for herself and from fine dalmatian fur apart from glen close i found all cast quite silly but from a child's eye funny that is fair enough as its target market is i assume children under 12 quite a good entertainment for children and families but didn't do much for me out of
<START> there are no spoilers in this review there's nothing to spoil br br no plot nothing most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some tenuous stretch but this didn't even do that clips three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips ok so perhaps they were short on production time but they'd have been better off skipping this episode entirely what a waste of time br br i'm not sure how this got made in fact scrubs is usually much better at subverting tropes but somehow this got through br br thank heavens they were back on form by the next episode
<START> the only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it really is with a plot that makes your average middle school writer look good and acting which is almost as good it gets my bottom score one of tom hanks very early films where he obviously didn't have the pleasure to be real picky the best special effect of the movie consists of a guy dressed up in an incredibly fake rubber monster consume
<START> has there ever been a movie more charming than this one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other's lives the center of it is the romance of james stewart and margaret sullavan who work together and can't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies including you've got mail the recent update of shop they're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near tragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have christmas dinner with a must see out of
<START> the national gallery of art showed the long thought lost original uncut version of this film on july 10 2005 it restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release the character of the cobbler a moral goody goody individual in the original censored release of 1933 is here presented as a follower of the philosopher nietsze and urges her to use men to claw her way to the top also the corny ending of the original which i assume is in current vhs versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form a wonderful film of seduction and power hopefully there will a reissue of this film on dvd for all to appreciate its great qualities look for it
<START> i just don't see how a concorde new horizons film directed by jim wynorski and featuring the acting talents of andrew stevens and a puppet could be bad it just boggles the mind doesn't it br br well let's make no mistake about it munchie strikes back is indeed a bad film munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries for reasons not fully explained until the end of the film he is sent to earth to help a single mother and her son the mom's problem her main problem at least is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks to the not so tiny tune of 20 000 ouch she can't come up with the money because she just got fired ok just is the key word in that sentence what the was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck maybe it would've been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it ya think br br munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess but there isn't a limit on the number of wishes you can make munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall munchie was borrowing it from the annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating a baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the earth several times sadly those dumb parents watching the game don't think it's at all strange hmm br br anyway i'd like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is you'll be truly moved by the scene where leslie anne down playing the mother kicks a dog which is yapping at her your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer munchie strikes back 's credits promised another film to follow entitled i believe munchie hangs ten to date the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force heh 1 10
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen i was going to get up and leave at tape 4 but i stuck it out i now consider myself a masochist afghanistan come on guys who's the idiot who forgot to hide the sanskrit billboards i thought the lead actor george calil was particularly inept apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake i thought using the events of 9 11 as a reason to make larson the lunatic implodes all over a screen near you disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of 9 11 using a phone call from larson's wife sarah supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day was appalling the camera shake didn't make me feel sick that cold hearted stunt did
<START> i gave this movie a 5 out of pure pity my intention is not to burst anyone's bubble because i've seen as i've skimmed through other comments that this movie is quite appreciated by many well it is not worth any praises and i say this because i've seen the original anime basilisk and this movie shames it deeply perhaps if you see shinobi alone you could like it it is enjoyable due to the well choreographed battles based on fantasy more than on martial arts and i agree that their beauty is deeply enhanced but the story is nothing like the original one now i understand that when one transforms an anime manga into a movie one must make certain changes i was not expecting to see the freakish characters from the anime although they have a well established role and some are truly profound and well designed but i certainly did not expect to see immense and wrongly placed changes that basically ruin the entire story characters who are dramatically and unethically mutilated transformed in something the public might love more perhaps for instance oboro who in the anime is a sweet innocent girl completely and utterly in love with gennosuke becomes a vengeful clan leader in the movie i liked the fact that the woman becomes strong and evades the limitations imposed on her by the era we are talking about japan 17th century but her mood changes are unbelievable and badly written hotarubi which is one of my favourite characters in the film but who is not known for her childish and sensitive nature becomes a pathetic little girl who is not only not madly in love like in the anime but is more or less worthless in the plot i could go on and on like how they made tenzen the worst and most dangerous character in the anime exceptionally weak and unattractive or how gennosuke the leading character seems completely misplaced and confused not to mention again weak the music is beautiful and the image is astounding which was expected of a japanese movie and i appreciate it for that but do not watch this if you've seen and enjoyed basilisk because it is just hopeless basilisk although based on fantasy with elements of horror and largely exaggerated is splendid and has so much more depth in its characters storyline historical value and it is may i say heartbreaking shinobi was a waste of time and i could not believe it kept on going after what was supposed to be the climax alas it pains me deeply to judge a movie so harshly but i advise you against it please watch the anime or at least watch the movie first and then repair your image of what basilisk really is by watching the anime otherwise you will have a seizure when you realize how they've massacred it
<START> lord alan cunningham antonio de teffÃ¨ is a nutjob seen early on trying to escape an insane asylum with this castle slowly succumbing to ruin likes to kill various hookers who resemble his deceased wife evelyn a woman who betrayed him for another man with those red locks this nutcase is quite wealthy and his bachelor status can be quite alluring he however is overrun by his obsession with his late wife's memory specifically her adultery he saw her naked with the lover while the memory of evelyn is almost devouring his whole existence alan tries his best to find true love and believes he has with gladys marina malfatti who spends most of the film naked that's probably her lone attribute since she isn't a very good actress who agrees to marry him after a very short courtship which should probably throw up flags right away there's a key moment of dialogue where she knows exactly to the very amount what he is worth br br the only real person alan can confide in is his doctor from the hospital dr richard timberlane giacomo rossi stuart there are other key characters in this film that revolve around alan alan's cousin george rod murdock seems to be quite a good friend who often supplies him victims i mean dates while holding onto hope of getting his lord's estate some day albert roberto maldera evelyn's brother is a witness to alan's slaughter and instead of turning him into the police squeezes him for cash aunt agatha joan c davis wheelchair bound lives at the castle estate and is often seen snooping around behind cracked doors we later find that she is having a love affair with albert br br all that is described above services the rest of the story which shows what appears to be the ghost of evelyn haunting alan someone is killing off members of the cast family that revolve around alan and the body of evelyn is indeed missing br br the ultimate question is who is committing the crimes after alan and gladys are married where is evelyn's body and will alan go over the edge i have to be honest and say i just didn't really care much for this film it's badly uneven and the pacing is all over the place it looks great on the new dvd and the rising from the grave sequence is cool but what really hurts the film in my mind is that the entire cast is unlikable you really have a hard time caring for alan because he is a psychotic who is skating on thin ice in regards to holding his sanity he can be quite volatile who commits the crime really isn't that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off there aren't but a choice few who could be doing it what happens to alan doesn't really make your throat gulp because you can make the argument he's just getting what he deserves those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to alan as i pointed out before aren't that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstances or advantages they'd have that would benefit them with the collapse of alan's sanity then everything just comes off less than stellar i thought the editing was choppy and unexciting but the acting from the entire cast is really below par some stylistics help and there is a sniff of gothic atmosphere in the graveyard sequences to help it some
