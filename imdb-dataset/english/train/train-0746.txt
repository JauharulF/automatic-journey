<START> this was one of the dvd's i recently bought in a set of six called frenchfilm to brush up our french before our planned holiday in beautiful provence this year so far as well as improving our french we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of french cinema br br what a breath of fresh air to the stale predictable unimaginative crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by hollywood what a good example for screenplay writers actors directors and cinematographers to follow it was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures br br the other thing i liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly naÃ¯ve benefactor with the type of contempt that an ex con would display will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her the viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each other br br once you have seen this film like me you may want to see it again i still have to work out the director's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look the plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office you must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place but if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of french cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied four stars out of five for me
<START> while this outing certainly doesn't live up to its predecessor it does have more than its share of memorable moments my personal favorite just after laying waste to a city block with his videodisc cannon we see a close up of nimoy's face as a single tear sheds from his left eye we know at that point that nimoy is more than just a killing machine the viewer can't help but be pulled into his emotional turmoil and we understand that his previously flat affect was only a facade absolute brilliance the sex scenes display a nice balance carnal but not pornographic afterwards i felt i had a pretty good understanding of how to work the magnavision videodisc player too bad they haven't produced them in over 25 years
<START> warning here be spoilers why do i waste my hastily fleeing years watching garbage like this this film is an impressive collection of clichÃ©s poor writing worse directing and then we haven't even got to the acting yet br br and of course you can predict the whole story from beginning to end br br hero expert fights against stupid corrupt and incompetent henchmen one avalanche goes off burying all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive in spite of going through all sorts of cliffhanger perils corrupt partner who caused the whole thing gets fried alive together with his payoff money second avalanche heroically deflected by renegade expert's adventurous experiment evil henchmen in the end turn out to have a heart as well troubled teenager falls into the arms of her crusty stepmother after being saved by her etc etc etc etc on and on it goes br br in fact there's little reason to warn for spoilers you could probably work the whole plot out if i gave you the basic ingredients at least i wasn't too wide off the mark most of the time anticipating what would happen next br br and then we haven't discussed the factual errors br br i agree with a previous commentator that even though there are usually some redeeming features even of a bad movie you'd be hard pressed to find any in this one i suppose i gave it 2 out of 10 for some nice scenery shots but that's it br br it's been some time since a film made me groan but this one certainly did
<START> overall i agree wholly with ebert's review in a sense i feel that i should not even be commenting since it is so much a vet's movie and i am not a vet i was a resister the flaw is that martha is badly underdeveloped and does not act consistently my guess is that stephen metcalfe is a vet himself and spent too little planning time on her character
<START> channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels this show was certainly a naughty one the presenter of this sometimes gross adult chat show four time bafta winning and british comedy award winning also twice nominated graham norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this it had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it they basically had an adult idea which would either gross humiliate or humour the guest but some are not for the faint hearted they had women playing the recorder with their parts men using their dicks to play a xylophone women weeing upwards in the bath men with or without pants under their kilts and many more gross but hilarious ideas this is just for adults but enjoy it it won the bafta twice for best entertainment programme or series it won the british comedy awards for best comedy entertainment programme also nominated best comedy talk show it won an emmy for episode 18 and it won the national television awards twice for most popular talk show it was number 52 on the 100 greatest funny moments very good
<START> the lovely eva longoria parker plays kate who dies after an ice angel crushes her before the i do's with fiancÃ© henry paul rudd after two years henry has yet to move on and his sister chloe lindsay sloane is very concerned chloe arranges for henry to talk with an attractive psychic ashley lake bell ashley is to contact kate's spirit hoping to help henry get on with his life when the psychic starts getting attracted to henry kate's ghost appears to nip the romance in the bud there are some funny situations but if you've seen the trailers you have seen the substance of the film also in the cast stephen root jason biggs william morgan sheppard and wendi mclendon covey i personally thought that bell stole the show from parker and biggs as usual a pain in the butt still this movie was over hyped
<START> this movie is more lupin then most especially coming from funimation other then the bad dub it isn't bad br br the first hour is a lot like the comic which is what all lupin the 3rd stuff is based on lupin's trying to get a huge treasure fujiko's using lupin's weakness to women to try to get something out of it the last bit isn't that bad he's with another women but of course fujiko's still him number one br br a lot of the other lupin movies are more family with cuss words then lupin any good lupin fan i think will be pleasantly surprised i know i was after hearing so many bad things about this movie it might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits they make it a little mushy but overall it isn't a bad film good enough to be one of the few i'd watch again of the lupin iii movies
<START> this movie was clearly done poorly and in a rush i realize that the funding for any such movie is hard to come by however if the plot had any kind of original substance someone would have seen that it got the necessary funding this was not the case and movies like this are not necessary themselves and have no purpose in existing the plot for this movie has been done and done better i might add many times before there is no reason to make a movie that has no chance in competing with any others i was informed by my computer that i need a minimum of ten lines to submit my comment so the following lines are just bull to fill in space in my opinion there is no need for anything else to be said about this film what i've said is plenty and if you wasted enough time reading this review than for god's sake don't waste more time watching this movie the only exception to this is if you are the kind of person who likes watching crappy movies that get played on the womens entertainment network at 2 00 a m in that case go ahead see what i care
<START> i have seen dirty work several times and is probably my favourite stan and ollie short br br in this one stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and get the job to clean the chimney at the home of professor noodle lucien littlefield while noodle is doing mad experiments in his lab stan and ollie cause much chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess of the living room the end is where ollie falls into a tank of special formula that noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimp the best part is where ollie falls down the chimney and loads of bricks land on his head but he doesn't seem to suffer much pain from this br br dirty work is stan and ollie at their funniest great fun br br rating 5 stars out of 5
<START> nut case is murdering college students can new teacher stop the madness br br believe me you won't care br br with a title like splatter university one would immediately gather that this movie just isn't high art but worse than that splatter university doesn't even qualify for amusing garbage splatter u is so poorly made the story is mindless the characters are throw aways and the whole movie lacks any essence of imagination needless to say there is no suspense or atmosphere or scares this drivel isn't even brave enough to throw in any nudity for the cheapest thrill of all so all around this endlessly flawed slasher offers nothing in the way of entertainment not even cheap laughs and just becomes a complete bore bottom of the barrel folks even die hard slasher fans will want to think twice before viewing let alone paying money for this flick br br bomb out of
<START> jeff lowell has written directed 'over her dead body' poorly the idea is first of all is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake br br minus eva longoria parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance br br paul rudd looks jaded and least interested lake bell is a complete miscast she looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance jason biggs is wasted so is lindsay sloane br br i expected entertainment more from this film sadly i didn't get entertained
<START> in the hands of a more skilled director this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece despite michael death wish winner's merely passable direction the movie is interesting original and more than a little scary br br the script bucks more than one horror clichÃ© off its back several it can't shake including chris sarandon as the heroine's boyfriend who actually listens to her as she insists that eerie things are going down burgess meredith is delightful as the lovably insane neighbor eva gardner is haunting with a young beverly d'angelo as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover john carradine does a heck of a job sitting in a chair and watch out for a brief cameo from an unknown at the time chris walken this movie is creepy and creative the plot twists are lovely if a tad predictable the climax of which i will give no detail is disturbing and quite impressive again a better director could have done more with it nonetheless it is quite satisfying at least to those with the sensibilities of seventies horror br br if you like modern overproduced body counting torture fantasy you won't like this there is almost no gore the direction is quite spartan the effects are few although there's some delightful makeup near the end most of which actually isn't makeup but perhaps i've said too much already br br i've rated this a little higher than its quality may justify but i enjoyed it as much as any 8 film that i've seen
<START> baba rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life this is the movie which caused his downfall it was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred soon after its release he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably its a very bad movie with horrible acting bad quality makeup and pathetic screenplay throughout the movie rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease i'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw baba first day first show in theatre the audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission sorry i'll not recommend this one to anyone
<START> okay yes this was a very tight budget movie with continuity errors like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt out part and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles but come on richard grieco was hysterical his hair alone is worth the trip steven ford was very likable mancuso had some great lines while nancy allen ironically was completely bland and uninteresting classic no bad parts yes entertaining big yes i would have loved to have been on set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have are you fast y'ain't that fast
<START> love it love it love it this is another absolutely superb performance from the divine miss m from the beginning to the end this is one big treat don't rent it buy it now
<START> ouch they don't come much worse than this horrid adaptation of c s lewis's beloved novel while the adaptation is very true to the novel the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play i've read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the bbc has ever given at the time but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the 2 that it looks like this was filmed for the worst effect of all is mr beaver i know computer effects weren't at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role avoid this at all costs
<START> a question for you a family go to a new house and get stalked by demonic forces which film am i talking about every horror film you ve seen yes that s true but that s not the answer i m looking for i ll narrow it down by saying there s a lot of teen angst scenes doesn t help well there s lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature s pov no futher forward okay there s a dream sequence involving lots of blood could still be any horror film you say oh gawd this could take weeks so i ll say the film i m talking about features loads of aussies many of whom have appeared in neighbours and home and away yes that s right the film is the third circle aka cubbyhouse and do you understand what the above exercise is about it s about me pointing out how the third circle is absolutely no different from any horror film that s been made
<START> i'm from romania i'll try to speak in english all i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one seen it above 30 times at least and will see it for many years now it has all the little things i like in a movie it's very touching makes me cry shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality and the true things that matter for different people it so happens that for me this matters the most the love the soul of a man he's inner being and this i see in this movie perhaps for me it's much more than a motion picture it's a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate it's a long way from reality to sci fi but what if what if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down would fall we would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that on your death bed the bigger thing you remember is not the wealth not the adventure not the countries you visited and the people that remember you but the true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die all will be god damn perfect and people would be good and care more watch this movie and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me hail from romania
<START> while fred schepisi's i q doesn't really have any important qualities it's still worth seeing walter matthau plays albert einstein trying to help mechanic ed walters tim robbins fall in love with princeton mathematics doctoral candidate catherine boyd meg ryan probably the funniest scene is when dr frizzyhead and friends lou jacobi gene saks and joseph maher try to make ed look like a scientist he ends up looking like a french impressionist br br obviously little of the movie is historically accurate but that's not the point it's not intended as anything except a light comedy quite the opposite of robbins's most famous movie from 1994 the shawshank redemption a movie about einstein's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements but also his political activism namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the scottsboro nine and came out against nuclear weapons it got to the point where the fbi kept a file on him br br so anyway this one is acceptable also starring stephen fry tony shalhoub frank whaley charles durning and keene curtis
<START> dragon hunters has to be the best looking animated film i've ever seen it was jaw dropping the film is about a couple rogues in search for some cash their weird furry blue dog that pees fire and a girl who dreams about becoming a knight and they are sent on a quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill the world gobbler an impossibly immense dragon but honestly it doesn't even matter what the film is about because it is jaw droppingly gorgeous the gravity in this fantasy world is different so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float around amidst cathedrals and castles and villages alike and there are forests of floating lily pads the world is so creative so uniquely beautiful with a sort of muted storybook look to it the world looks like a set of gorgeous paintings the monsters are visually stunning as well like a fire dragon comprised of a swarm of evil red bats some of the plot isn't too original like the main protagonists wanting their farm a la of mice and men and never seem to be able to make it in the world but the gorgeous graphics some seriously sinister scenes and emotion evoking dialog makes this film spectacular
