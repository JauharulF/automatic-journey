<START> this is a wonderful film makes the 1950's look beautifully stylish kim novak is intriguing and compelling as a modern day witch with one foot in manhattan and another in infinity all the supporting performances are terrific from jack lemmon as her bother nicky to ernie kovacs as the author of magic in mexico who is working on magic in manghattan to elsa lanchester as the slightly batty as well as witchy aunt queenie and then there is the cat i have no idea how many witches besides me have named a cat pyewacket but suggest a zillion jmes stewart looks out of place but only just as much as his character is out of p ace in this weird sub world of magic and witchcraft perfect and it has the perfect romantic happy ending which we believe in because movies of this vintage do have those happy endings gillian and shep certainly have as much chance to be happy ever after as rose and charlie allnut in the african queen another great film
<START> me and my girlfriend went to see this movie as a premiere surprise that is we bought at ticket to the preview to a movie before it opened here in denmark we sat through the 1st hour or so and then we left the point of the movie seemed to be simply to portray the era and club 54 but it did so at the expence of character development of which there was none and plot of which there was little br br seldom have i been so indifferent to the characters in a movie br br the music was good though so if you like to hear some good music and get a fix of that 70ies mood i guess it is ok but don't expect to get a plot of believable characters br br
<START> okay okay maybe not the greatest i mean the exorcist and psycho and a few others are hard to pass up but the shining is way up there it is however by far the best stephen king story that has been made into a movie it's better than the stand better than pet sematary if not quite as scary better than cujo better than the green mile better the dolores claiborne better than stand by me just barely though and yes it's better than the shawshank redemption shut up it's better i don't care what the imdb top 250 says br br i read that a couple of decades ago stanley kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie and from the other room his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration finally she didn't hear any noise for almost two hours and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something i tell this with all due respect of course she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand and the book was the shining and thank god too because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever br br stephen king can be thanked for the complexity of the story about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing jack nicholson can be thanked for his dead on performance as jack torrance how many movies has jack been in where he plays a character named jack as well as his flawless delivery of several now famous lines heeeeeere's johnny ' shelley duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to jack's desires to kill her stanley kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls br br one of the most significant aspects of this movie necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect is the isolation and it's presents flawlessly the film starts off with a lengthy scene following jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter this is soon followed by the same thing following jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel this time the scene is intermixed with shots of jack wendy and danny talking in the car in which kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of tv as wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of danny who says that it's okay because he's already seen it on tv see it's okay he saw it on the television ' br br the hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place and it's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge echoing rooms and the long hallways these rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie and kubrick's traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three dimensional feel early in the film there is a famous tracking shot that follows danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his big wheel is that what those are called and his relative speed as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner and being a stephen king story you expect something to jump out at you i think that the best scene in the halls as well as one of the scariest in the film is when danny is playing on the floor and a ball rolls slowly up to him he looks up and sees the long empty hallway and because the ball is something of a child's toy you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him anyway you get the point the shining is a damn scary movie br br besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn't suck the shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed had jack always been there like mr grady told him in the men's room was he really at that ball in 1921 or is that just someone who looks exactly like him if he has always been the caretaker as mr grady also said does that mean that it was him that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters and not mr grady after all it's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied that's just mediocre filmmaking for example the amityville horror which obviously copied much of the shining as far as its subject matter did this but it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think as mostly all of kubrick's movies are one more thing that we can all thank stanley kubrick for and we should thank him for is for not throwing this book against the wall that one toss would have been cinematic tragedy
<START> this screwy comedy seems very forced indeed the actors try very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script and as a result it doesn't really go anywhere the idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant after getting a quickie divorce just isn't all that funny and then when cooper sneaks off with the baby because he doesn't want it put up for adoption just seems terribly unfunny and it's really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy it's really a shame too as the actors were more capable than the script and i found myself just bored by the whole mess considering that cooper made so many good comedies i recommend you see them instead
<START> you will recognize the plot immediately daughters of a divorced couple trying to get mom and dad back together again yes that was the theme of the parent trap in the 60s 80s and 90s but here's the spooky thing even though deanna durbin was younger than the 21 year old hayley mills while playing the doting daughter s roles durbin looks much older as in adult and so do all of her so called siblings br br and this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film the girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits but look ridiculous in them as the director seems to take pains to point out their ample tops and tushies throughout the film so you're constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women when ray milland and others start hitting on them you get the feeling as if they're pedophiles and you might be one too for noticing those tushies and tops the director was pointing out teens or temptresses little girls or little foxes you are never quite sure what you're supposed to be thinking of them as br br the parents too seem very old and the whole film seems very dated br br it is a rusty version of the parent trap and you should avoid it or at least ensure your tetanus shots are up to date if you don't believe me
<START> greenaway's films pose as clever erudite and innovative yet his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the world war 1 era of film making the frame composition use of mid shot the static camera it may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new perhaps like that other innovator ts eliot he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could br br yet greenaway's biggest failing is that he cannot write his dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician brecht where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor which is poised and logical so the joke is dead before it's delivered the result is tedium if it's not funny it has failed ask a stand up comedian to justify their act if the audience doesn't respond perhaps the well read director could learn something from freud on humor br br finally like woody allen greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones they speak the lines with a bored smug air like narcissistic adolescents br br this film despite its design and lighting is meretricious
<START> noni hazlehurst colin friels alice garner chrissie amphlett and michael caton what more could you ask for monkey grip based on the prize winning novel of the same name explores nora hazlehurst a single mother falling for a heroin addict jobe friels a simple story is made truly extraordinary through the all round magnificent acting in particular noni hazlehurst and nice use of the small budget the only flaw is if you can pick it up is that the story is set in melbourne although for budget reasons the film was mainly shot in sydney so as a result in a few scenes you see trams melbourne scenes and then a carlton post office sydney scenes other than that monkey grip is a must see excuse the clique but it is at least for an award winning performance from former play school and better homes gardens presenter noni hazlehurst br br 10 10
<START> if scientists behaved in a way that h g wells was confident they would in the future history wouldn't quite have turned out the way it did in things to come were almost 80 years past the point that wells wrote the shape of things to come on which this film is based and no closer to the world he describes than before in some ways farther away br br though such well known players as raymond massey ralph richardson and cedric hardwicke are in the cast they're more caricatures than real characters it's the main weakness with the film it's devoted to wells's philosophy of science will solve all problems and the rest of us are backward fools br br massey's characters two generations of the same family holds that supremely optimistic view cedric hardwicke is a skeptic who feels man is rushing too far forward and ralph richardson is a warlord arisen from the destruction of another thirty years war fought with modern weapons by the way as the atomic bomb had not been invented poison gas was deemed to be weapon that almost destroys mankind br br according to wells science and conquest can never mix scientists as a group are far too above the world of politics to engage in such things in wells's lifetime scientists certainly fled the rightwing fascistic governments of hitler and mussolini those same folks however in order to defeat them subordinated themselves to the allies and fashioned the atomic weapons that ushered in the modern age if they behaved as wells would have liked them to someone like albert einstein would have headed a junta of scientists who would have established a new order after world war ii br br wells got it wrong both in time and in development he apparently never envisioned the computer as well as atomic power computer programmers are far more likely to be our rulers in a brave new world than scientists at the moment still things to come aided by the direction of william cameron menzies and the sets created offer an interesting glimpse into the mind of h g wells certainly a respected thinker of his time though he didn't quite get right the shape of things to come
<START> i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a good looking horror movie to watch over the new year's weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent b grade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semi interesting so i rented it what a mistake don't be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent i'm thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodoo inspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murder br br story sound somewhat good well it is and this movie could've been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial 911 sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhs quality camera and i'm assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someone's bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didn't hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just bad br br overall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent b movie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it could've been alright but this movie fell flat on it's face if you're expecting something semi decent you'll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate d grade horror flicks otherwise you'll probably want to stay away from this straight to video garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess 1 10
<START> if you watched this movie you know why i said jesus jesus jesus hehehe every time they said jesus jesus jesus i laughed thinking jesus jesus jesus why did i rent this movie i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen wtf is timberlake dreaful acting i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him but i really prefer an actor not this android called timberlake and his girlfriend was shallow hollow and annoying as hell i was happy when they both were popped in the street br br the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all it would have been much enjoyable without him br br by the way the music was ok but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes low motion and things like that something misplaced for this cops movie i thought maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake
<START> i really do not have any clue as to why some people find the power rangers television show even remotely interesting at all the costumes are completely ridiculous and the people playing in them also look completely foolish at the same time there is absolutely anything remotely interesting about the power rangers this is just a higher priced television commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic garbage to the unsuspecting children around the world from the notes i can see that it's been banned in the country of new zealand and from what i have seen i can agree with their decision avoid this show at all costs it's terrible and ridiculous
<START> its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book this poor copy steals lots of material from the first three films going as far as even copying how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters and it basically tries to cram in three films into one and fails it fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one except with the odd exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old films br br the only thing we can be thankful for is that there has not been an omen v
<START> johnnie to's election has some cool music on the opening creditsÂand a nice opening credits' design too a kaleidoscope of chinese characters and those asian mobsters solemnly taking an oath or uttering some sacred stuff as a matter of fact the whole flick is nicely scored i have found about to from bishop seraphim sigrist and was quite eager to see a to movie the one with which i began election is exciting and interesting and only moderately violent by nowadays standardsÂmoderately and also essentially violent the story of an asian godfather's scheming it uses a puzzle play of elements violent facts from the mobsters' lives the race for the scepter true details and as with coppola we are expected to believe that some of the morally glamorized mobsters are entitled and nice and likable the performances are reasonably amusing and colorful br br election is well made in the enjoyable somewhat careless style of the hong kong fare the ending is bitter true straight and will scare the kids
<START> an american in paris is an integrated musical meaning that the songs and dances blend perfectly with the story the film was inspired by the 1928 orchestral composition by george gershwin br br the story of the film is interspersed with show stopping dance numbers choreographed by gene kelly and set to popular gershwin tunes songs and music include i got rhythm 's wonderful and our love is here to stay it set a new standard for the subgenre known as the songbook musical with dozens of gershwin tunes buried in the underscore the climax is the american in paris ballet an 18 minute dance featuring kelly and caron set to gershwin's an american in paris featuring an impressionistic period daydream in the style of various painters is one of the longest uninterrupted dance sequences of any hollywood film the ballet alone cost more than half a million dollars a staggering sum at the time br br it's funny to think of such a work of art being born over a pool game between film producer arthur freed singin' in the rain wizard of oz on the town meet me in st louis and the band wagon and ira gershwin it was freed's idea to buy the title so he could use if in a film about paris and gershwin's idea that it would only use gershwin music br br original cast was to have cyd charisse but she discovered she was pregnant before shooting began a major reason gene kelly suggested leslie caron as the female lead was because he felt this movie needed a real french girl playing lise not just an american actress playing one gene kelly discovered leslie caron while vacationing in paris where he saw her perform in a ballet when she got the call to audition she said who's gene kelly according to leslie caron her introductory dance sequence which included a seductive dance with a chair was considered too suggestive by some censors gene kelly directed the brief fantasy dance sequences shown as lise is introduced br br vincente minnelli first wanted maurice chevalier in the georges guÃ©tary part and 'celeste holm' in the 'nina foch' part br br minnelli was a groundbreaking director of musicals with meet me in st louis 1944 an american in paris and the band wagon 1953 he used color and songs in ways they hadn't been used before he used space and time imaginatively best of all though he allowed himself to cut loose for the long ballet sequences that end all his movies the ballet in an american in paris may be his best work br br even though vincente minnelli is credited as the sole director he was sometimes tied up with his divorce from judy garland and other directing projects leaving gene kelly to take over the directing duties br br other highlights include guetary's rendition of stairway to paradise oscar levant's fantasy of conducting and performing gershwin's concerto in f see why it was oscar levant's favorite br br the ballet sequence now that we know it was successful everybody now wants to take credit for it freed minnelli kellyÂ but before the film was completed the new york office of mgm said no to spending a half million dollars on a ballet so freed went to studio head louis b mayer himself and got him to agree new york said no finally gene kelly showed the new york office how a british film the red shoes used a long ballet sequence and that film became a world wide hit Â and is still considered today the premium example of a successful art film well the financial guys finally gave in and signed the checks br br there was a break in production after 1 november 1950 at which point gene kelly began rehearsing the ballet choreography by the time production for that final sequence resumed on 6 december vincente minnelli had finished directing another film father's little dividend 1951 br br irene sharaff designed a style for each of the ballet sequence sets reflecting various french impressionist painters 'raoul dufy' the place de la concorde edouard manet the flower market maurice utrillo a paris street henri rousseau the fair 'vincent van gogh' the place de l'opera and henri de toulouse lautrec the moulin rouge the backgrounds took six weeks to build with 30 painters working nonstop br br roger ebert said after viewing the recent restoration an american in paris has many qualities not least its famous ballet production number with kelly and leslie caron symbolizing the entire story of their courtship in dance an american in paris is often compared to singin' in the rain as to which it the greatest musical ever made and one critic put it best when he said singin' in the rain makes me happy and an american in paris makes me feel good the ballet represents kelly's fantasies as depicted by the great french artists renoir rousseau lautrec dufy he admires arranging a screening for the then ailing raoul dufy the actor and producer ducked out until the end credits there relieved they found the artist moved to tears requesting a second helping of the sumptuous finale br br the film was also the first to win a golden globe award for best motion picture comedy or musical br br gene kelly received an honorary academy award that year for his versatility as an actor singer director and dancer and specifically for his brilliant achievements in the art of choreography on film it was his only oscar
<START> i know it is fashionable now to hate this movie i have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 haunting as well as most of the hammer films this film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it yet many viewers can accept out of control films like scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great i have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time the director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense the haunting lets go and is certainly not boring perhaps this film might appeal more to john carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure the old haunting was also a fine film from 1963 it was even more scary see both and also the innocents and the legend of hell house with pamela franklin
<START> sure 65 years have passed since thalberg's last production was filmed but fellow imdb members come on this movie is surely one of the masterpieces of the 30's it is a 10 br br this was the first movie i saw at new york's museum of modern art around 1970 i was a teenager expensive looking yet with scenes of such poverty masterfully photographed often thrilling and always engaging to me it was mgm movie making at its best what did audiences feel when they glimpsed a locust attack the person by person destruction of a mansion the horrific poverty and then the splendor of wealth br br last week those watching the academy awards had a glimpse of the senior oscar winner in attendance luise rainer how grand to see an actress who arguably delivered one of the most masterful haunting performances in history electing to return for a celebration br br ok so she should not have won the year before great ziegfeld but don't blame luise talkies were only a decade old when this was released and her dialogue limited but as olan her use of visual and vocal is memorable br br large scale and touching what more could a movie lover want
<START> man this movie sucked big time i didn't even manage to see the hole thing my girlfriend did though really bad acting computer animations so bad you just laugh woman to werewolf strange clips the list goes on and on don't know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie and i don't mean all the naked ladys it's something about the light or something this could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women but not because it's an original movie white a nice plot twist my final words are don't see it it's not worth the time if you wanna see it because the nakedness there's lots of better ones to see
<START> though the pieces are uneven this collection of 11 short films is truly a moving and human experience there were some who in the wake of the emotion on the anniversary of the bombings took this to be anti american i don't think thats the case even though some parts might be taken that way if you don't look behind the obvious ultimately the film is nothing except an attempt by people to express their confusion sympathy and feelings about what happened these are stories of people who's worlds have been shaken up by what happened on a tuesday in september br br as i said this film will move you probably to tears its not always easy to watch for example the film from mexico is little more than a black screen with sound but its effect is such as to lay even the strongest of people low if you can be strong you really should see this film it will comfort you and enlighten you and affect you
<START> and i'm serious truly one of the most fantastic films i have ever had the pleasure of watching what's so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good but if possible better than the novel it was based on perhaps in the case of lord of the rings and trainspotting but it is a rare occurrence indeed but i think that the fact that louis sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further this film has many elements that make it what it is br br 1 a unique original story with a good mix of fun and humour but a mature edge 2 brilliant actors adults and kids alike these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard as sometimes happen with kids movies 3 breathtaking scenery and it doesn't matter if it's real or cgi the setting in itself is a masterpiece i especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view 4 a talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius the transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book leading up to the twists throughout the film 5 louis sachar the guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that i couldn't put it down he makes sure that the script sticks to the book with new bits added in to make it even better 6 and speaking of the script the one liners in this are smart funny and unpatronising but there are also parts to make you smile make you cry and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more 7 beautiful soundtrack there's not a song in this film that i haven't fallen for and that's something considering i'm supposed to be a punk rocker the songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film if you're going to buy the film i recommend you buy the soundtrack too especially for if only which centres around the story and contains the chorus from the book br br i do not work for the people who made holes by the way i'm just a fan plugging my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves if you haven't seen it do it now this very instant go
<START> i definitely recommend reading the book prior to watching the film this book won national book council award in 1978 and is a very gripping read pun not intended it's not too difficult to read for those out there that don't read often so don't be afraid the book seems to capture the passion of the relationships more so than the movie and the movie will make more sense after reading the book having grown up in melbourne i could really relate to this book and movie very few australian female writers were around the in the 70's therefore very little is documented about the way of life for a women in an urban city in australia during this era or class it's a precious piece of melbourne history it's a shame that it is documented as some sort of 80's soft porn movie it's far from that and as the other reviewer has mentioned please do not read the dvd jacket it does not represent what the movie is about at all those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed just remember this movie was made in 1982 so don't expect the hollywood over dramatization that they seem to incorporate these days this is what i like about it it's also great seeing noni hazlehurst in this role she is just fantastic as nora and it's great watching her really acting for if you're close to my age you will best remember her for her stints on playschool and better homes and gardens who knew she hid this talent this movie will give you an entirely new impression of her a classic australian story
