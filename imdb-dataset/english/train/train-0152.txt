<START> the 74th oscars was a very good one whoopi's work as emcee was very funny and light i personally loved her last apperance which garnered some frigid reviews due to coarse language and salacious jokes but that's fine the audience seemed to like it halle berry denzel washington ron howard woody allen and sidney poitier made this an oscar telecast to remember br br
<START> after seeing midnight offerings i am still convinced that the first decent movie about teenage witches yet has to be made i didn't think much of the craft and i'm not into charmed either the only film i more or less enjoyed about teenage witches was little witches 1996 and even that one wasn't very good but changes are that if you liked all the aforementioned movies you will also enjoy midnight offerings br br i was expecting a silly and cheesy early 80's movie about teenage witches in high school but i was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious the acting is decent and serious all the time no jokes are being played by teenagers or something and the musical score at first i thought was pretty good it added some scariness and also something 'classy' with the use of threatening violins and all but as the movie progressed i came to the conclusion that the score was just too ambitious they didn't have to add those threatening violins when you simply see someone back up a car and then drive away at normal speed br br then there's melissa sue anderson who was the main reason for me to see this movie a few weeks ago i saw her in happy birthday to me a rather enjoyable thick plotted and goofy on some occasions slasher movie which she had done in the same year as midnight offerings and i must say she was very good as the icy cold bad witch vivian but the main problem with the movie is almost nothing happens vivian causes a death and an accident yes but that's it then there's robin the good witch who is just learning about her powers and we expect the two of them using their powers more than once but at only one occasion they use their powers to make some pieces of wood and other stuff fly through the air as projectiles that was supposed to be a fight between two powerful witches and what's worse i was hoping to see a spectacular show down between the witches at the end of the movie with at least some special effects flaming eyes or whatever but nothing happens there is sort of a confrontation in the end but it's a big disappointment br br so the acting of the two witches was good the musical score was decent even though overly ambitious and the cinematography was rather dark and moody at times but that doesn't make a good movie yet does it
<START> i've loved this movie ever since it first came out i was about nine years old and now i'm 27 i remember playing the video game on sega genisis i had so much fun i would love to show my son this movie he likes michael jackson as well and i know he will love this movie just as i did when i was a kid even though he's much younger than i was when i first saw it i can't wait for it to come out on dvd i hope it comes out on dvd please let it come out on dvd i'm dying to see it again well that is my comment i hope that one day soon i'll get to view this movie again i love all of the videos in this movie my favorite mini video is badder
<START> i won't claim to be a fan of ralph bakshi because i am not i have only watched 5 of his animated films so far coonskin wizards fritz the cat and lord of the rings and finally fire and ice what i can claim is that i found fire and ice to be the most enjoyable of the lot it is a straightforward fantasy tale of swords and sorcery along the lines of conan the barbarian but the beautiful artwork realistic animation and lively film score effectively lends a very classic charm to this movie br br deserving first mention is the animation itself i do not care what people say about rotoscoping but in my opinion ralph bakshi used that technique very effectively here i was amazed at how realistic the movements of the characters were the style of directing and the photo realistic character designs made fire and ice feel more like a big budget fantasy blockbuster than a cartoon sadly the level of art detail tends to get a little inconsistent especially near the end of the movie some scenes just look really flat with little to no body contour details or fabric folds and shadows on the characters br br with realistic moving characters realistic action would naturally follow not only was the action well choreographed but it was really brutal i would be so bold as to compare the brutality of the action to live action movies like zack snyder's 300 i did notice however that though there was blood shed the blood splatters were kept to a minimum again a great choice by the creative team that only heightens the viewing experience by not taking things too over the top br br though i do not recognize any big names in the cast the voice actors manage to deliver a satisfying performance keeping the delivery of every line realistically subdued and only hamming it up in the case of the bad guys br br did i say bad guys yes i did because that is exactly what the story is about a standard good vs evil tale nothing really original about the story which seems to merely be a mix of pre existing fantasy film clichÃ©s that involve scantly clad warriors and maidens anyone looking for depth would be sorely disappointed the characters are not given much development and some of them like nekron and darkwolf are one dimensional at best i did however hear rumor of some deleted scenes that explains darkwolf's obsession with killing nekron and his mother scenes like that deserved full restoration and should have been included in the final cut to add a level of depth to the show in fact i would not be surprised to find out that the whole movie was just a tech demo of sorts to showcase the awesome animation and art with the story cobbled together and thrown in as an afterthought in order to pass it off as a proper movie br br a true classic of a bygone era fire and ice really captures the blazing spirit of adventure and mysticism with its beautiful renderings of fantastic creatures and charming characters it is a unique vision of a world created by ralph bakshi and artist frank frazetta with a good measure of action and suspense br br would it hold up to animated film standards of today definitely not but i urge animation fans in general to get off your high horse and give this simple but beautiful film a chance to grow on you it is truly a gem of the 80s worth checking out
<START> the movie has one nude scene a man sitting on the edge of the bed with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen it is quite a long scene what was the point i almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasn't funny to have that staring at us for what seemed like a full minute br br the movie is cold none of the characters are even likeable audrey tatou is cute of course but her character is an unhappy girl br br i really would not recommend this movie i had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing i wondered if the director was from a very upper crust educated french family and he looks down on these characters br br
<START> stephen king was raised on flicks like this flicks not films br br movies like this and 'jeepers creepers' are throwbacks to the good 'ol day drive in horror flicks they are meant to be fun cheaply made and hopefully a few good scares br br anyone looking for a theory on the human condition should pass on this creature feature because that's all this is all it ever will be br br stop trashing what has already deemed itself as trash good fun trash br br if you enjoyed this i recommend 'jeepers creepers' 'jeepers creepers 2' '30 days of night' 'scarecrows' '88 'they live' 'planet terror' 'death proof' and 'halloween iii season of the witch'
<START> i love jamie foxx br br and i enjoy 99 of all movies i see br br and i walked out of this one br br now i admit it may have had something to do with the two middle aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing oh no jamie's knocking on a door hee hee hee but this was just so incredibly annoying there could be no sustained camera shot and no camera shot from a conventional angle everything had to be in your face loud and annoying br br the bad guy tried to be smooth and malkovich like but at this point it's just old and tired he brought nothing new or interesting from all the characters too many lines you saw coming too many you've heard before and too many tough guy lines and i don't mind that sort of thing really as long as there's a bit of originality to it in fact pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked br br i love jamie foxx and i think he's really funny and i thought he was funny in this movie but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else br br this movie needed less shoot em up less annoying camera shots more emotion more feeling and more jamie foxx i gave it a 2
<START> this amusing bugs bunny cartoon sees the return of the still unnamed marvin the martian and his sidekick k 9 the green dog br br this time instead of trying to destroy the earth marvin is on a mission to land capture an earth creature and take it back to mars of course the creature he picks is bugs bunny at first bugs thinks marvin and k 9 are trick or treating but realises this can't be right when marvin drastically enlarges bug's rabbit hole with a ray gun bugs tries to trick his way out of the situation in a couple of ways including persuading marvin that k 9 is planning a mutiny eventually he is captured using an acme strait jacket ejecting bazooka amazingly for an acme product it works as advertised and bug's is forced to use his wits to get k 9 to release him the tables are soon turned and the two disgruntled martians are trussed up and bugs is trying to fly their saucer back to earth br br i really enjoyed this although the ending is a little weak compared to the rest of the story marvin's voice has changed slightly here and he gets visible emotional when he is angry but this didn't make me like him or the cartoon any less
<START> not really spoilers in my opinion but i wanted to cover myself nevertheless as the executive producer morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 items or less a movie with an intentional indie feel and just be absorbed in the mentor be all that you can be theme he plays a alternate universe semi washed up version of the real morgan freeman who is chauffeured in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson ca from brentwood to research his next movie role why carson is a mystery to so cal residents he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san fernando valley and found the same elements paz vega is pretty to watch a cross between salma hayek and penelope cruz playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for moragn freeman's research his character is only known as him to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people psst that's 'him ' etc unfortunately i was too distracted that him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in brentwood carried no cash or debit card or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does then i gotta see cash and a blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which him definitely has nothing really happens in this movie i don't believe that either of the main character's were substantially changed by their encounter with each other it flirts with the idea of adultery but then that thought fizzles this to me was similar to steve martin's shopgirl without the sexual affair it was self indulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience
<START> the real story took place in kansas in 1959 of a murder perry and dick two ex convicts who broke into a remote house on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met richard brooks directed the chilling and disturbing capote's book about the reasons that drove these kids to the crime are they natural born killers the crime scenes are very brutal and haunting because of the lack of senses and reasons for what we witnessed stunning black white cinematography from conrand hall excellent country road music score from quincy jones amazing performances in two principal roles from robert blake and scott wilson and first time in a movie a sad comment about capital punishment at the last moments before their deaths jones hall and brooks as director and as writer for adapted screenplay are academy award nominees gripping superbly directed and frightening one of the best films of this decade
<START> like the characters in this show i too was a teen during the 70s the producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist of being a suburban teenager in the 70s the 70s fashions cars home furnishings foods and fads are all very authentic in this show br br the show boasts a very talented ensemble cast who all mesh together very well on camera i really like the unique psychedelic style film sequences no other show does camera tricks like this these cutting edge film sequences really help to convey the campy hipness that characterized the 70s era br br overall this is a very funny sitcom the one thing that bothers me about this show is it's over reliance on cruel humor to generate laughs in this way i think that this show tries to be too much like married with children while married with children is a great sitcom in its own right it's tacky that the creators of that 70s show keep trying to imitate it br br i do recommend that 70s show mainly due to it's nostalgia factor it could be an even better show though if the writers relied more on witty dialog rather than bawdy tasteless jokes and pranks
<START> i love sabrina its one of my fave shows my favourite episodes are the one where she turns libby into a geek the first episode the true love episode and most of the rest from the first series i do think the college episodes were not as good as the high school ones but they were better than the last series which was awful valerie was a good character as she was more rounded than jenny but jenny was in some brilliant episodes hilda and zelda were amazing and there seemed to be no explanation for where they went libby was a good character too i never liked morgan or roxy they just weren't as good as her other friends
<START> i happened to see this movie twice or more and found it well made wwii had freshly ended and the so called cold war was about to begin this movie could therefore be defined as one of the best propaganda patriotic movies preparing americans and secondly people from the still to be formed western nato block of countries to face the next coming menace the movie celebrates the might of the us through the centuries while projecting itself onwards to the then present war which had just ended nice and funny is the way of describing the discovering of the american continent by columbus and pretty the espisode of new amsterdam and the purchasing of manhattan from a drunk local indian must see it at least once for curiosity of fashion of propaganda through time
<START> worth watching twice because of the rapid paced causal shifts among several compelling stories bug emerges as a wholly satisfying work of art that plays ever optimistic love against myriad examples of frustrating reality br br my favorite characters are wallace john carroll lynch whose overriding concern for life from that of a cockroach to the airline passengers for whom he is partially responsible frames the film olive christina kirk who spends considerable time creating surreal but tasty meals for her impossible husband ernie chris bauer and mitchell a cable tv technician with unbounded trust in fortune cookie messages you will meet the girl of your dreams br br against such optimism are the forces of quirky reality all generated by actions of the characters parking tickets a clogged drain in a chinese food donut shop tv disruption a crushed auto fender an obliterated dinner reservation that eventually results in cancellation of a hawaiian vacation br br the film is funny olive getting drunk at a chippendale performance johnston michael hitchcock as a customer service rep attempting to deal with an irate customer the germ obsessive cyr brian cox facing a restaurant inspector dwight jamie kennedy reacting to his girlfriend's refusal to have children by writing hostile chinese cookie fortunes your girlfriend is lying to you and the guy who falls asleep while manning a jackhammer because he spent the night looking for his girlfriend's missing cat br br a minor story with public cable access host darryl theirse and a local acting teacher reading from the boy in the bubble expresses the major theme love comes from the heart br br bug entertains on much the same level as trains planes and automobiles but on a lower budget and with a fresher eye
<START> when i first read the plot of this drama i assumed it was going to be like sex and the city however this drama is nothing like it the stories the characters seem more real and you empathise with the situations more the concept of the drama is similar four 30 something women guide us through there friendships and relationships with problems and strife along the way katie the gp is a dark and brooding character who you find difficult to relate too and is best friends with trudi a widow trudi's character is heart warming as you can relate to difficulties she is having along with the fact she is the only mother of the four jessica is the party girl very single minded and knows what she wants and how to get it she is a likable character and is closest to siobhan the newly wed who whilst loving her husband completely can't help her eyes wandering to her work colleague over all the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the bbc continue to produce the series it could do well it is unlike other female cast dramas such as sex and the city or desperate housewives this if played right could be the next cold feet plus the male cast are not bad on the eyes too
<START> problem with these type of movies is that literally dozens of them are being made each year luckily for use only a handful are given a theatrical release while the others are being pushed straight to video or tv such as this movie br br the foremost problem of this movie is really its originality it's one of those movies which uses the die hard formula of a tough but troubled guy being at the wrong place at the wrong time in this case it's a character played by casper van dien who works for a security agency that thoroughly test safety procedures for companies and individuals in this case he's being send to a cruise ship which of course gets hijacked you can see this movie as a sort of mix of die hard and air force one and the movie doesn't even try to conceal that those two movies were probably its biggest source of 'inspiration' so really you can't regard this movie as an original one at all it uses all of the clichÃ©s out of the book and this movie really doesn't offer any surprises or anything that remotely resembles anything original br br like you can expect from a movie such as this it has a very weak script or rather said it features some very lazy writing like i said before the movie features nothing original but also the actual story itself features some elements which are far from likely and are just plain ridicules truthfully i mean hijacking an huge cruise ship with only about 8 guys of which halve only carry some small guns and then ask for a ransom of 'only' 10 million dollars for a ship that is about worth 10 times that amount is itself already quite ridicules how do they even intend to split that money afterward every person gets just over a million or something that's hardly profitable for such a big and risky undertaking and then there is the case of taking the passengers hostage somehow they manage to take all passengers on the huge ship hostage and they manage to put them inside one room with only one guy with his pistol which he can't even seem to be able to hold right watching them you never see more than like 30 hostages however as if they were all the people who were aboard at the time also when the van dien character goes looking for his son and vice versa no matter which room they walk in through on the huge cruise ship they always bump into each other instantly just some examples of the lazy writing within the movie br br but it of course is an action flick so the story of course becomes secondary but then again it's not as if this movie features any good action at all halve of the actors look as if they had never hold a weapon before and the movie is filled with some ridicules slow motion it really becomes laughable at points br br of course the movie also doesn't feature the best actors though i must say that casper van dien really isn't a bad 'action hero' and actor as far as the genre and b movie circuit is concerned he just however also suffers from the same problem as tom cruise no matter how old he is he just never looks convincing enough to play the father of a teenager van dien once started out as a promising new young actor but starring in movies like this really doesn't help his career much he's probably capable of something better though he is never really given the right opportunity to show it all of the other actors also do a fair enough job but their characters are just so formulaic that they never truly become interesting br br oh well it's not the worst genre movie i have ever seen but it also ain't exactly the most original or memorable one either br br 4 10
<START> the scottish artist andy goldsworthy fashions natural materials into ephemeral artworks assembling rocks into egg shaped cairns filling riverside rock pools with fiery flowers and stitching thorns and twigs into intricate web patterns an original work and a few photographs of his other creations are tucked away in a corner of southampton art gallery near where i live but although i found these pieces intriguing i only realised the wonder of goldsworthy's work when i was lucky enough to catch a re screening of rivers and tides br br thomas reidelsheimer's film accompanied by a beautiful instrumental soundtrack by fred frith brings goldsworthy and his art to life by showing the artist at work the opening scene captures him fusing icicle fragments into a snake like thread set atop a tree stump working with his teeth and bare hands goldsworthy crafts a beautiful ephemeral work before long this delicate sculpture melts away to nothing in the brilliant nova scotian sunlight this scene is among the most beautiful in the film but the breadth and inventiveness of goldsworthy's work is remarkable reidelsheimer shows both the successes and the failures capturing the frustration of pieces that collapse before they are completed as well as the glory of those that shine even if for just a few hours minutes or seconds br br goldsworthy himself provides the narration speaking slowly but thoughtfully about the themes in his work he makes plain his need to work with nature to be alone in it and to further his understanding of it through trying to work with natural materials even when they seem to be working against him at times he is down to earth and humorous at other times he struggles for the words to express his purpose Â something which is quite understandable when witnessing his astonishing work first hand the 'rivers and tides' of the title become increasingly pertinent as we see the natural materials pass through the artist's hands flowing from one form to the next the capture of the creation and dissolution of goldworthy's work is in itself a striking piece of art br br although goldsworthy works with widely varying materials and covers territory across north america and europe the presentation of artworks one after the other in this film is exhausting it gave me the same feeling of fatigue that i get when i spend too long in an art gallery and struggle to take in anything new a brief interval in which we are introduced to andy's family and hometown is all that breaks the long succession of his artworks nevertheless reidelsheimer does a superb job in photographing goldsworthy and his creations locating them in their wider environments from meandering canadian rivers to rainy scottish hillsides fittingly the film ends with goldsworthy casting handfuls of earth and snow into the sky fleeting patterns emerge from the dust particles even as they dissipate into the air this is the purest expression of the beauty to be found in the work of this remarkable artist
<START> and i am a nicole kidman fanatic i would pay to see and hear her read the moscow phone book which for all i know she may have been doing when she was speaking russian in this movie br br all four of the principals are excellent but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothing br br while one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie this one asks too much of the viewer br br it could have been very funny which it is in parts or quite frightening which it is in one scene but the director didn't seem to know which way to go
<START> just finished this movie saw it on the video shelf and being a nick stahl fan i just had to rent it in all honesty it probably should have stayed on the shelf the concept was an interesting one and there were several fairly smart twists and turns but somehow i guessed almost all of them before they came along and the movie just went a little too far in the end in my opinion if you have to suffer through a viewing of it you'll see what i mean br br on a positive note nick stahl's acting was great especially considering what he had to work with eddie kaye thomas was also good but he always plays the same type of character too much paul finch from american pie coming through for my liking br br and finally the worst part of this movie has to be january jones' emotionless performance i guess a pretty face really is all that matters in hollywood
<START> a masterpiece br br thus it is possibly not for everyone br br the camera work acting directing and everything else is unique original superb in every way and very different from the trash we are sadly used to getting br br summer phoenix creates a deep believable and intriguing esther kahn as everything else in this film her acting is unique it is completely her own neither british nor american nor anything else i have ever seen there is something mesmerizing about it br br the lengthy unbroken natural shots are wonderful reminding us that we have become too accustomed to a few restricted ways of shooting and editing
