<START> fear of a black hat is everything the much weaker cb 4 should have been rusty cundieff's satirical eye is ruthless as he folds spindles and mutilates every aspect of hip hop trends and culture does foabh resemble spinal tap yes a bit is it derivative of spinal tap no not really the aim is more focused the satire is better focused and to be honest it's funnier
<START> at last a decent british comedy that isn't centred around some mockney bank robbers or spun off from a tv series john ivay's film is a psychoactive tale of discovery dressed in biker gear the three protagonists are gentle fools with a penchant for failure and each at a turning point in their lives giving a sensitive emotional trio of sub plots to sew the riotous comedy together the chemistry between the three amigos is palpable and makes for a touching companionship with hilarious dialogue and some classic comedic moments it feels part withnail and i part american werewolf in london and part quadraphenia but only because of the bike gangs and phil daniels in fact phil daniels' lovable rogue reminds you of danny the dealer in withnail and i with his scholarly approach and scientific commitment to drugs this is a great film particularly for those who've dabbled in psychoactive substances in the past who will relate to many moments in the film a personal favourite is the brilliant scene in the welsh corner shop buying munchies while tripping on 'shrooms this gentle comedy will warm the cockles of your heart and have you laughing out loud and you don't have to ride bikes or even like them to enjoy it but it'll add to it if you do brilliant
<START> i love bad movies not only because they often are as entertaining as 'really' 'good' films like pirates of the caribbean series and other hollywood pathos but they often are far better than those films and that's the reason why i love italian rip off cinema of 1970s and 1980s and that's the reason why i especially love this movie the barbarians the company br br director ruggero deodato has made some actually very good movies like house on the edge of the park and also his atlantis interceptors and live like a cop die like a man are enjoyable action movies but this is really bad the barbarians is so idiotic movie peter and david paul as the barbarian brothers kutchek and gore are very funny because of their lack of charisma and acting skills but if they can't act they yell and scream every time they do something important in one scene people try to hang the barbarian brothers and they escape very extraordinary way br br bad acting bad special effects very stupid story bad direction actually everything is bad in this movie i can't describe how much i laughed when i watched this first time the barbarians the company is camp classic everybody should see once if you thought plan 9 from outer space is fun camp this will be a real killer
<START> i loved anchorman the legend of ron burgundy and hoped this would be just as funny but alas it wasn't some bits are excellent though i thought the sports guy champ kind professing his love for ron burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team was hilarious everyone is ignoring him and he just gets louder and louder and finally kisses burgundy which doesn't get acknowledged either but on the whole the story doesn't gel it's a noble attempt however to salvage the unused bits from the first movie including an entire plot about some pretty benign would be domestic terrorists called the alarm clock maya rudolph of saturday night live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines but basically this unused plot line has good reason to be unused in the first movie the extras on this disk are pretty good with the best two being the filmed rehearsals featuring lots of improv comedy and the faux commentary with will ferrell and an exec producer who ferrell discovers early on was not even a part of the movie in any way shape or form turns out he's just a guy who walked in the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer it's some pretty funny stuff though and goes on for about 10 or 15 minutes
<START> i was never so bored in my life hours of pretentious self obsessed heroin addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems it's like watching lizards molt even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy if you have insomnia rent this
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this two parter the impossible planet and was slightly worried that the second part wouldn't hold up quite so well as has been true in the past of the two parters of the past 2 who series but thankfully my fears were unfounded as i found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one anyway we start off with the surviving crew members on the run from the ood whom have become the devil's pawn there is also a bit of philosophizing on the doctor's part in the episode that i quite enjoyed needless to say it was a good solid doctor who story might be a tad too intense for the younger viewers though br br my grade b
<START> this overrated short lived series a measly two seasons is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar i am not quite sure what they mean by ground breaking and original when they fawn all over lynch and his silly little tv opus what exactly is their criteria of what is original sure compared to the bill cosby show or hill street blues it's original definitely next to law order tp spews originality left and right br br fans of tp often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers weren't smart enough open enough for the show's supposed weirdness its alleged wild ingenuity or whatever as a fan of weirdness myself i have to correct that misconception there is nothing too off the wall about tp it is a merely watchable rather silly whodunit that goes around in circles spinning webs in every corner but or because of it ultimately going nowhere the supposed weirdness is always forced the characters don't behave in a strange way as much as they behave in an idiotic way half the time there's a difference br br whenever i watch the weird dream sequence in living in oblivion in which the dwarf criticizes the director buscemi for succumbing to the tired old let's use a midget in a dream scene clichÃ© i think of lynch you want weird eraserhead is weird in fact it's beyond weird it's basically abstract you want a unique tv show watch the prisoner you want a strange looking cast felini's and leone's films offer that tp looks like an overly coiffed tv crime drama in which all the young people look like fashion models the cast gives tp a plastic look kens barbies en masse br br in fact one of the producers of tp said that lynch was looking for unique faces for the series unique faces like lara flynn boyle's sheryll fenn's like those effeminate faced hunks straight out of men's catalogs or gay magazines don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast especially with beauties like fenn the way madonna would look if she were 1000 times prettier but then don't go around saying you're making a weird show with weird looking people and i have never understood lynch's misguided fascination with kyle maclachlan i should get a medal for bothering to spell his name right he is not unlikable but lacks charisma seeming a little too bland and polished his character's laughable eccentricities were not at all interesting merely one of lynch's many attempts to force the weirdness trying hard to live up to his reputation him having completely lost his edge but that time everything lynch made post elephant man was very much sub par compared to his first two movies what followed were often mediocre efforts that relied on lynch's relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting meanings into his badly put together stories that don't hold any water on closer scrutiny in other words lynch is every intellectual wannabe's darling br br so laura palmer was killed by her dad he was obsessed by the devil or some such nonsense that's the best this great mind could come up with you've got b movie horror films that end with more originality br br lynch is neither bright nor hard working enough to come up with a terrific story br br go to http rateyourmusic com fedor8 and check out my tv cinema 150 worst cases of nepotism list
<START> with all thats going on in the world sometimes we need an escape curly sue is just that not a complicated plot or deep meaning however it is not devoid of substance there is more than furious action or heart pounding dramas there are the charming little shows you can watch with your kids and have enough substance to enjoy with your date try it you may like it more than you think the little girl is really smart and cute the dad and the girl go thru some slapstick routines when a jealous boyfriend steps in trouble brews for curly and the life shes known may be torn asunder fred thompson and kelly lynch play good roles as the upper crust and alison porter and james belushi are a interesting fable like duo portraying street wise homeless drifters their worlds collide and comedy ensues
<START> arrrrrggghhhhhh some people take life far too seriously watch this film for what it is sit back relax and have a giggle the film does not take itself seriously so neither should we if you like james belushi you will like this film if he is not your cup of tea give it a miss br br i like james belushi so i liked this film so simple isn't it
<START> after seeing this film i feel like i know just a little bit more about the usa david lynch is synonymous with shock value and weird for weirdness sake and indeed these elements are not missing from the straight story however it is in a light that i have not witnessed from lynch before we begin with a simple family living a quiet life but end up with an array of absurdly interesting characters with depth in their lives that cannot be apparent from their introduction especially moving was the bar scene with two wwii veterans discussing the events of fifty years ago and how it still affected their current lives and emotions if you are looking for wild at heart or dune don't look here but if you are looking for real people with real stories this is the film for you
<START> i saw this as a child in the late eighties and i must say galaxy express is one of those films that sticks in your imagination for a long time if you've never understood the appeal of anime discovering this film may be your golden ticket to otaku town br br the story is as delicate and poetic as ridley scott's blade runner the cell animation while somewhat traditional possesses a vivid style that explosively portrays leiji matsumoto's great talent for character design and visual storytelling br br this is one of those unique children's films like star wars the dark crystal and the wizard of oz that completely transcends 'family entertainment' status and stands as a classic of cinema on its own terms br br i highly recommend this film
<START> this wasn't funny in 1972 it's not funny now br br unlike a lot of other people i'm not bashing the film because it is incredibly sexist i quote enjoyed that bit or rather i enjoyed the reaction it generates in annoying pc people i'm bashing it because it is poorly written and acted br br the only really memorable character is blakey which british people 25 years old will recognise immediately since he was a favourite with impressionists for a long time br br avoid br br
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this movie but it is nothing new br br everyone here is grouping it with other war movies this movie has been miscategorized its not a war movie any more than one flew over the cuckoos nest is a asylum movie or cool hand luke is a prison movie this is a movie about individuality nonconformity self confidence and the costs of that personality type br br the plot is the same as one flew over the cuckoos nest and cool hand luke its in good company and it holds its own its these movies it should be held up against and compared not apocalypse now or platoon br br eric
<START> delightful minor film juggling comedy and detective romance and drama genres as nimbly as lt kenny williams melvyn douglas balances his devotion to his girl maxine carroll joan blondell and his duty to the force as an ace detective br br this hodge podge may not appeal to all viewers today but in its day it had something to offer every member of the movie going family and the resolution to the rather tired feeling versus duty plot is original and refreshing and well worth the wait br br the amazing mr williams contains what must be among the most outrageous blind dates in film history and its bright comic repartee sparkles ludicrously frocked melvyn douglas delivers some of the best lines i'd walk down main street in a turkish towel before i'd let any woman control my life and the effervescent joan blondell lets her barbs fly with typical aplomb good grief you look like my aunt nellie ' br br the crime solving here is standard fare although a fine cast of character actors helps bring the material to life br br from today's vantage point the amazing mr williams is perhaps most interesting for its insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct all the more malleable for its seemingly rigid boundaries while much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes at times it is both subtle and penetrating playing out not only in some of the finer details of the film but in the battle of genres that reaches its culmination in the final scene
<START> a story of amazing disinterest kills the psychic over and over again the characters and plot are completely uninteresting as is fulci's mad camera work which is usually a redeeming factor in his films and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found it's padded out to an insufferable degree by the end you won't be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom and like me maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep jennifer o'neill's performance deserves occupancy in a better movie fulci gorehounds beware there's just not much going on in the psychic br br 3 10
<START> i decided to watch this one because it's been nominated for oscar this year i guess as many folks here i really wanted to like this movie but ended up bored and disappointed first scene was ok but the whole rest of the movie in shaky hands camera mode is really annoying br br i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for oscar is this br br american military machine people who makes money on war urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by bungling up something sort of patriotic br br why these heroic efforts of director and the main character to inspire the audience with an idea of loving war like a drug oh please come on what a bore br br watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall
<START> ok when i saw the previews for this movie i thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group i was with now living in america especially during this election i see some very deceiving things but i have to say these previews were towards the top of list i don't see how so many people could be scared by this movie i only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one the whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me as for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of i thought they were comical at best oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why the worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning how does that scare someone i can make that noise easily now don't get me wrong i have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but i didn't even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad
<START> gwoemul the host due to pollution in the han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage the youngest member of the park family is snatched by the beast and it is up to the rest of her family to find her before she becomes the beast's latest meal br br firstly i love monster movies mutated bears over sized alligators packs of ravening komodo dragons the whole lot creature features are my favourite kind of horror film so i really wanted to like the host but it wasn't to be br br there were three major problems with it br br the first can be seen with a quick look at it's imdb page br br genre action comedy drama fantasy horror sci fi thriller br br too many damned genres it took itself too seriously to be a comedy and yet was too light hearted to have any real message though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement anti pollution anti american or anti government the drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mish mash with all the other styles br br secondly after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film the central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of korea and america apparently do nothing and that's it they just wander about occasionally hitting one another presumably for a bit of comedy relief this lack of action made my attention wander and apparently it did the same for the director as whole plot threads go unresolved a mystery plague invented by the evil americans is completely forgotten about and is never resolved br br and lastly the film is clumsily political it paints the americans as being stupid and evil but gives us no american characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain the opening scene has the most obvious stupid american vs wise korean moment with a korean morgue assistant asking his boss the coroner not to pour chemicals into the han river the american coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on as well as being racist it's lazy film making and there is no excuse for that br br on the plus side the monster is good kind of a mix of the relic and deep rising some of the movement effects are quite cool and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun there are also some nice shots in the film some of which remind me strangely of the way firefly was filmed shuddering cameras out of focus shots etc there is also a nice scene at the end where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the family's mobile food stall it's night time and snow is falling the street lamp is giving out a cold light but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it br br overall i was really disappointed by this film i'd been looking forward to a decent creature flick and instead i get some pseudo political horror comedy lite looking at the comments on imdb i can't help but think that if this had been a us production it would have been slated just 'cause it's a foreign flick doesn't mean it's any good there have been some great movies out of korea in recent years the vengeance trilogy and brotherhood for example but this certainly isn't one of them br br for once i'm in favour of a remake tighten up the directing improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film as it is it's not worth a couple of hours of anyone's time
<START> i've read countless of posts about this game being so similar to max payne when i played it the first time i thought it was a bit weird arcade like game with a desire to rip off the max payne style not just bullet time so when i played it for a couple of hours i realized how much fun it is and how different from max payne yeah the bullet time is a bit similar but i think it fits differently to the game style this game is non stop action a mix between a shoot'em up and a fight'em up so much fun as a big fan of max payne i must say that the storyline of dtr is not near to the greatness of max payne the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same but if you want a bit more of that bullet time you should definitely own this game
<START> there's not a drop of sunshine in the sunshine boys which makes the title of this alleged comedy neil simon's sole ironic moment simon who adapted the script from his play which goes uncredited equates old age with irrational behavior and worse clumsy galumphing mean spirited irrational behavior walter matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner george burns for a television special it's said they were a team for 43 years which begs the question how long did vaudeville last anyway burns who won a supporting oscar has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in after which time matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back the noisier the movie gets the less tolerable and watchable it is director herbert ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of neil simon's screenplays here ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off such as semi incoherent matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a tv commercial at this point matthau was still too young for this role and he over compensates by slouching and hollering it was up to ross and simon to tone down the character to nuance his temperament to give the sunshine boys some sunniness yet walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf the picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace one loses hope for it early on 1 2 from
