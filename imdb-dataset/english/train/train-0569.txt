<START> i am terribly sorry i know that faÃbinder still is called one of the greatest directors in post war germany and that most of his films are considered master pieces but when i see lili marleen today in 2004 i wonder what everyone is up and away about this movie the acting is simply terrible hanna schygulla is all the smiling like an idiot the changings between nazi glamour and battlefields are ridiculous the whole film looks as if it was made within two days in an attic probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to take this for real art but for me this movie is simply bad cheap compare this to viscontis la caduta degli dei and tell me again that lili marleen is a good movie
<START> this is my favorite movie ever i have watched it at least 10 times and i cry every time my family begs me not to watch it so i wont have a crying fit i think i love that it is a true story written by antwone himself just as much as i love the movie the acting is top notch and the actors were perfect for their role denzel washington is one of my favorite actors but this is my favorite movie he has done so far i took care of a little boy who was also born in jail he was the most precious little boy i had ever met he has now been adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years i saw this movie while the fight was still going on and his future was unsure and i am so happy he is safe and loved and i am so happy antwone's happy and found his family br br i would love to know more about him and how it has been since meeting his family i just cant say enough good things about it
<START> first off if you're planning on watching this make sure to watch the uncut version although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that were tampered with due to censorship it makes a huge difference this film is about a young woman played by barbara stanwyck who since the age of 14 has been forced into prostitution by her own father when her father suddenly passes away she is able to go out into the world on her own after reading about nietzsche's philosophies on life she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love throughout the movie she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder is she has any sense of morality left at all overall baby face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film while no sexual acts are explicitly shown on screen it is very obvious what is happening off camera br br i enjoyed watching this film very much and i believe most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment out if it especially with the films shock value i did think while watching it that the pacing seemed a bit slow at parts but i think that about most movies the first time is see them actually i think that almost all movies i've seen made from the early 30's had some minor pacing problems or certain parts just didn't quite flow right this was probably just the craft of film making wasn't quite perfected yet Â it would take just a few more years compare a film from 1939 and compare it with an early 30's film and i think you'll see what i mean br br once again i'm very glad i was able to watch the original cut it really does make a big difference also any john wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role
<START> one of the worst films i have ever seen how to define worst i would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again somehow one hit wonder zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends elvis fans mary kay saleswomen las vegas gays fbi agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed how elvis presley enterprises could allow the rights of actual elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be the only good elvis presley imitator is a dead one is beyond me the worst part of this mess and that takes some work is the mangled script in 1958 elvis' words and songs that he would speak perform in the 1970's are quoted worst special effect that oscar would go to the moron who decided that elvis' grave potentially the most photographed recognizable grave in the world resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere potentially this film's biggest audience would be elvis fans however the rampant stupidity nixon gave elvis a dea badge not fbi credentials and i could go on and on actually undercuts that conventional wisdom ugh i used the word wisdom to describe this stupid movie this is truly a horrible horrible film
<START> so one person says this movie is a beautiful delicate exploration of west german life after world war ii and the other says former nazis living in bombed out buildings and the movie is 'beautiful delicate' and the first sits there nodding takes another sip of coffee i can't explain just see it
<START> this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen again i made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too after buying this and the movie malevolence which i reviewed on here as well i have learned my lesson i love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm this supposedly takes place in the woods of texas but was probably filmed in the director's backyard the production was probably the worst i ever seen the actors were absolutely the worst the story didn't have anything to do with what the back cover said i even tried to sell it to f y e and some other mom and pop store that buys used dvds and neither would take it thats how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was i have seen some bad movies before troll 2 for example but this definitely takes the cake i didn't think there was a worse movie than troll 2 boy was i wrong do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what i am about to do
<START> one of the first of the best musicals anchors aweigh features several memorable musical sequences such as kelly dancing with jerry the mouse kelly dancing with 7 year old sharon mcmanus sinatra singing with jose iturbi playing piano kathryn grayson singing with iturbi conducting and much more the technicolor is perfect with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath through transparent keys and grayson singing seen through the finder of another camera the plot is thin but you get involved from kelly's sinatra's enthusiasm sailor's on leave they have to take home a runaway boy dean stockwell and sinatra falls for his aunt to set him up with the aunt grayson kelly suggests that sinatra can get her an audition with jose iturbi but sinatra's young and naive in this one and in his own sung words falls in love too fast while they're trying to contact iturbi who's never available he starts to fall for another girl barbara britton but kelly's now falling love with grayson anchors aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live action cartoon sequence with tom and jerry but there's a lot more here that's worth a look i'm giving it nine stars because while it's not quite as good as the best musicals singin' in the rain the music man oklahoma it is one of the first of their class of technicolor big productions perhaps meet me in st louis was the first and better than most others
<START> i saw this film numerous times in the late 60's early 70's whenever it reared it's head like a reindeer with rabies every november december as a saturday matinÃ©e kiddie show it was always stiff competition for the chrstmas that almost wasn't oops can i say christmas perhaps the greatest most iconic christmas season film of all time but that's another review br br at the time i marveled that the on screen tint of santa claus was almost pink and white so much had the color of the sprocket torn prints changed color br br the film is kinda creepy i thought so then and still do actually i was highly entertained then as i still am it's amusing in a retarted elf sort of way by the way the image quality looks much better on the dvd i have now than it did in the theater circa 1969 74 br br if you are expecting maybe the lost rankin bass christmas special forget it if you want fellini does christmas read on br br by nature the dubbing on these foreign films the original version here was in spanish always makes them seem surreal this adds to the films inherent oddness it is also pretty scary in that a mishevious demon as described in the original us trailer spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids evil one particularly nightmarish scene has a young latch key boy wishing he had parents for christmas suddenly the port a family emerges out of giant christmas presents of the mind until he realizes he's just daydreaming see this christmas lovers and if you're a stoner save your stash this film will make you think you're hallucinating without drugs
<START> i've seen this movie when i was traveling in brazil i found it difficult to really understand brazilian culture and society because it has so many regional and class differences to see this movie in sao paulo itself was a revelation it shows something of the everyday life of many brazilians on the other side it is sometimes a little bit over dramatized and that's the only negative comment i have on this film it's sometimes too much too much sex too many murders and too much cynicism for one film the director could film some things a bit more subtle it would make the film more effective br br despite this i liked the movie and the way the story unravels itself the characters are complex and very much like real life people not pretty american actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time that makes the film realistic even when the story is not that convincing
<START> this is just the best movie of all times sorry hollywood i've seen it in early 70's as soon as it appeared on the bulgarian tv and i loved it immediately i was 14 then 25 years later i bought it on a video tape and a few months ago it finally appeared on a dvd here in bulgaria i live with this movie 35 years already and so do all my friends and my family my son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time and he loved it immediately too and this is the generation that grew up watching practically only hollywood movies and not speaking or understanding russian at all what makes this masterpiece of danelia so special it's difficult to say as it is difficult to describe what the beauty is but the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as it was the first time i can't remember any other such movie no matter how many millions it cost or how great the cast was chapeau maestro danelia bulgaria loves you
<START> i had seen this movie long time back but found it amazing and to this day it has never stopped amazing me br br a wonderful movie that describes the account of a group of australian commandos who tried to sink some japanese ships at the singapore harbor during the height of ww2 br br these commandos are caught in plain clothes and they are considered to be spies by the japanese captors but something happens that hasn't been explored much in any hollywood ww2 movie that i have seen br br a close and friendly bonding develops between the captors and the captives they begin to respect each other while the captain of the captured australian soldiers become the best of friends with a senior japanese prison guard this is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really tugs your heart br br soon one day as the two friends are conversing the aussie captain learns that some other captives are going to be tried and executed for the sinking of the jap ships in the singapore harbor br br he mentions that it was his team and not some other's that had sunk the ships to his japanese friend and upon hearing this the japanese guard tells him to keep quiet as it might lead to his whole group getting executed but the captain remains adamant on confessing this to the japanese authorities br br finally the japanese authorities sentence them to death in the most respectful way that is according to their rules this is the highest honor accorded to the captured warriors in japan br br this is the most awesome part of the film where the aussie soldiers are awaiting their imminent death and the tense indecision of the friendly japanese guard who is still not ready to believe that why did his aussie friend confess being guilty br br i won't give away the ending here but it is more poignant than one can even imagine and can easily move one to tears br br all in all an excellent underrated movie that possibly didn't get the recognition that it deserved internationally get one copy today and be mesmerized
<START> as someone who has never condescended adam sandler in terms of talent as is done to him and many comic actors like him i walked in to reign over me expecting a great film not simply because of his presence in the movie but because i thought that it looked very good overall even someone who already thought that sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance is writing here that i was surprised at how fantastic he is in it he will make you weep especially in his purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue what's amazing about his role is that it's a character it's hard to say we've seen before we've seen many emotionally scarred characters many mentally retarded people many loners many passionate self centered artists but sandler's charlie fineman is none of these he may have a taste of each of them in some ways but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual it's a joy for the audience to be drawn in emotionally by him and be tugged every which way by someone whose problems mindset and provocations are completely different from most characters like him br br don cheadle delivers an interesting performance on a completely different level he is every man he is the most normal possible person in the world so much so that you will hardly find many characters like his either or at least any that are played the way he plays alan johnson whose name is even found on the assembly line cheadle is brilliant in that he is funny jolting smart and stupid the way so many normal people are br br the rest of the cast is populated by actors and actresses who've hardly done anything in awhile in smaller but quite colorful roles jada pinkett smith is the overly refined upper middle class wife donald sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge robert klein is sandler's desensitized father in law br br mike binder's script is quite brilliant because it says something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all of its guises it's much more subtle than say babel and has a much more close to home ideal br br the camera is only interested in the reality of its images as opposed to the mere style this film struck me as sort of a sendback to the kitchen sink style of the 1970s cinematography was grainy and unfastened but that was its charm it wasn't about attracting us to the camera itself and the gloss that would've diluted its stories with such br br the music which plays a major role in the film and its title is very powerful near the beginning you feel like you're in for another about schmidt or little miss sunshine sort of soundtrack but you soon realize you're in for more than that in fact the film is packed with lots of music that stimulates a lot of the most emotional scenes br br reign over me is a major statement not only for society but also for film itself it goes to show that even the director of blankman is capable of wonders
<START> this oddity from roman polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations lay at the time he made it polanski himself plays a timid man who rents a parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide he becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it to the point that he's dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded the movie's unsettling to a point and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread that polanski excels at but it comes off too much as a rehash of rosemary's baby and repulsion two other better polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments br br but as for the preoccupation unless i'm reading too much into the film i have to believe that this was polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at being labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from america not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself br br grade b
<START> the good i liked this movie because it was the first horror movie i've seen in a long time that actually scared me the acting wasn't too bad and the cupid killer was believable and disturbing br br the bad the story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak there just wasn't much to it the ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting i do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore br br overall a good scare but a bad story br br out of
<START> the lady in cement is a veritable course on social anthropology of the late 60's the writing not the acting is at center stage did i say pure camp prepare to be offended if you are female or gay broad and dame are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day camp wise most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors the action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see dan blocker play a tough guy who likes bashing toughs and lanie kazan and racquel welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers amazing to note they were both 28 years old and mr sinatra was 53 the musical score wait was there a score well you get the point watch it with friends who want a good laugh it's full of them
<START> frank mccarthy who produced the academy award winning biographical film patton follows it up with a strong tribute to another of america's fighting generals douglas macarthur gregory peck gives a strong characterization of the man his genius as well as his egotism with macarthur you never knew quite where one began and the other left off and too many times they blended br br the whole story of douglas macarthur would be a six hour film or a tv mini series it would cover him from his days on frontier posts with his family to his time at west point where he still has the highest scholastic average ever achieved by a cadet it would talk about his service in the phillipines as a young officer his legend building bravery on the battlefields of world war i in france it would also have to tell about him firing on the bonus marchers of world war i veterans in 1932 probably putting the final kabosh on any chances president herbert hoover had of getting re elected during macarthur's last years he and hoover had penthouse suites at the waldorf astoria in new york city that must have been a subject they avoided br br this film concentrates on the years 1941 to 1952 and it is told in flashback the film opens with macarthur addressing the student body in 1962 as he speaks the words of the famous duty honor country speech macarthur's mind goes back to world war ii and his desperate struggle against the advancing japanese on the island of corregidor and the fields of bataan on luzon the film takes him through his struggle to win back the phillipines the occupation of japan and the first 18 months culminating in his relief of command by president truman br br macarthur as a film would not work at all if it wasn't for the portrayals of dan o'herlihy and ed flanders as presidents franklin d roosevelt and harry s truman respectively it's the part of the film i enjoyed the best seeing macarthur and his relations with both these men br br fdr by o'herlihy captures the aristocratic squire and exceptionally devious man that was our 32nd president roosevelt was a man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and cleverness sometimes he liked scheming a little too much for its own sake but he was the master politician of the last century note how he deals with macarthur both as a battlefield commander and potential rival at the same time br br truman by flanders is as people remember him a blunt spoken man of the people who disliked macarthur's haughtiness from the gitgo of course it's in the history books how truman relieved macarthur in 1951 for insubordination macarthur was insubordinate no doubt about it br br yet i could write a whole thesis on the truman macarthur relations along the way it need not have ever come to a crisis i've always felt that fdr would have dealt with the whole matter in a far better way had he still been president then br br macarthur was also grandly eloquent and gregory peck captures some of that eloquence in some of the orations that made him as much a legend as victories on the battlefield listen to peck at the japanese surrender at macarthur's farewell to the nation before the joint session of congress and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962 watch the newsreels and see if you don't agree
<START> this was a superb episode one of the best of both seasons down right horror for a change with a story that is way way above the average moh episodes if there is such a thing a man's wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck in which he was driving his airbag worked her's didn't she is burned beyond recognition great makeup btw and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft but even in a coma she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology and when she does die for a few minutes her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit carnage of course ensues and also some extremely gory killings and also some extremely sexy scenes what more could you ask for you might ask well not much because this baby has it all and a very satirical ending that should leave a smile on most viewers faces i just loved rob schmidt's wrong turn direction too he has a great knack for horror excellent episode this is one i'm buying for sure
<START> here be spoilers br br the government has continued to develop the universalsoldier program now called unisol the soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before however the government is downsizing the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened so he takes steps to ensure his own safety he activates and controls the unisols and start to run mayhem the only one who can stop them is deveraux van damme br br this movie is about one thing choreographed fighting the story is bad and is soon drowned in all fights whatever happens and wherever they go they fight unfortunately for this movie it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible normally you're pretty sure the hero will win but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants not where one is indestructible and can't lose then the fights just become a tool to stretch time you wait until the final fight when deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes to further lower my opinion a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are well there aren't really that lot of them because the characters are most men there are at least one woman unisol though but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once the female leads get by with this but we also pass through a strip club to use a computer no less with much more undressed women these moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent minded male audience br br so in conclusion boring fights no more no less well maybe less br br 2 10
<START> matthew mcconaughey is a mysterious man waiting for agent wesley doyle powers boothe in his fbi office he claims to have information about a serial killer chased by fbi when agent doyle arrives in the office he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother agent doyle requests some evidence and the man tells the story of his life since his childhood they were a simple family of three his widow father meiks bill paxton his brother and himself one night his father gathers the two brothers and tells them that an angel of god had just visited him and assigned his family to destroy demons what happens next is one of the most scary movie i have ever seen br br i watched this movie four months ago on vhs and yesterday i watched again now on dvd although being a low budget movie the screenplay is sharp with no flaw the cast is outstanding but i would like to highlight the performance of matt o'leary as the young felton it is a very difficult and complex role to be performed by a young teenager the direction of bill paxton is remarkable there is no explicit violence in this horror movie a great debut behind the camera i regret the brazilian title of this movie 'a mÃ£o do diabo' the devil's hand' if at least it were 'the god's hand' it might be acceptable but calling this movie as 'the devil's hand' is indeed ridiculous brent hanley the screenwriter did not deserve such a lack of respect from the brazilian distributor this film is highly recommended my vote is eight br br title brazil a mÃ£o do diabo the devil's hand
<START> having looked at some of the other comments here i have a main complaint with this presentation br br the two primary characters are attractive in their own ways the beautiful victim and the handsome obviously extremely off center blue collar protagonist if just short of totally deranged take turns beating the hell out of each other sort of like a caucasian kabuki scenario br br this is all right and this is of course mainly a turning the tables story however my referenced complaint is that i believe the director got caught up in his desire to display farrah's well known and obvious physical attributes beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin robe and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect while immensely pleasing to the eyes these distract from the poignancy level of the drama br br her roommates i'm certain give performances as written and directed however their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing don't ring true based upon farrah's previous experience with this guy the obvious evidence of his having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred br br but this is a film and story compelling as much in spite of as because of the director's work
