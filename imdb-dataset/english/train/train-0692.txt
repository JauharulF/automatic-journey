<START> as usual i am making a mad dash to see the movies i haven't watched yet in anticipation of the oscars i was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley i can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has there is no story a group of guys meander around iraq one day they are here diffusing a bomb tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire no wait here they are back in bagdad there is no cohesive story at all the three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures by that i mean we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying we have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe and then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn't follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers dvds what do you think is going to happen well do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn't follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways why yes do you think the iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy why yes there is no story here the script is juvenile and predictable the camera is shaken around a lot to make it look artsy and for all of you who think this is such a great war picture go rent full metal jacket deerhunter or platoon don't waste time or money on this boring movie
<START> this serial is interesting to watch as an mst3k feature but for todays audience that's all it is i was really surprised to see the year it was made as 1952 considering that fact alone makes this a solid lowly 2 in my book the cars used don't even look contemporary they look like stuff from the 30's it's basically cody the lone world's salvation sheesh talk about an insult to everyone else like the military anyway it's cody in his nipple ring flying suit against graber and daley two dumb ss henchman who sport handguns and an occasional ray gun thats pretty lame in its own right enjoy if you want to watch a really good serial see flash gordan it's full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and also good looking women this has none of that and flash was made 15 or so years before this crap so you can give it some slack something made in 1952 this bad deserves a 2 nuff said give it a 6 if your watching it as a mst3k episode those guys have some good fun with it a tweak of the nipples here a tweak there and i'm flying and now as an added bonus i bring you the commander cody theme song as originally sung by joel and his two character bots tom servo and crow aboard the satellite of love for episode eight the enemy planet br br singing at the very beginning credits br br tom servo singing your watching commander cody he is the new character from republic br br he gets in trouble every week but he's saved by editing br br just a tweak of his nipples sends him on his way br br a pumpkin head and a rocket pack will save the day br br joel singing his labratory is a boxing ring when bad guys come to mix it up br br somebody always gets kidnapped and cody has to fix it up br br he drinks his tea at al's cafe and flies along on wires br br he beats the crooks and flies with hooks and puts out forest fires br br crow singing br br bad guys beware cody is there br br you'll like his hair it's under his helmut and because we can't think of a good rhyme br br that's the end of the commander cody theme song so sit right back with a will of granite br br and watch chapter eight cause that's the enemy planet
<START> i agree with the previous comment the beginning of the movie is quite good and get's you wandering about what is to come which is nothing all open story lines remain open two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture save for 1 or 2 very short scenes i wander if ilya wouldn't have done better to just completely leave them out as for the one remaining character nothing is done with her either she just visits some god awful place and suddenly the movie isn't about her anymore but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread drinking homemade vodka and apparently flashing each other some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling like the judges of the iffr but for me it is just bad taste bad camera work a lousy script and frightfully bad direction therefor i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading 1
<START> this is one of those films the british lottery fund wastes its money on the main problem is a rambling script which gets nowhere the characters are not interesting the story is conventional and insipid the only thing of interest is the location the city of genoa genova in italian having only a superficial acquaintance with genoa i had no idea of the intricate alleyways of its old town and that the city was so interesting i had thought genoa was dull i am delighted to say that i have been proved wrong so from the travelogue point of view this film has interest the film contains one splendid performance by a little girl named perla haney jardine she has already made seven films despite being only 12 so she seems determined upon a career as an actress and judging by her performance in this film she should go far as she is a natural and has a great deal of talent colin firth a reliable and professional actor was on hand for the filming and when asked to be earnest he was earnest and when asked to be anguished he was anguished but somebody forgot to give him any worthwhile dialogue the script is a total shambles catherine keener does exceptionally well in a supporting role and showing sympathy comes naturally to her so that everybody would like to have her around i would like to tell her every time i feel a cold coming on as i know she would get me a soothing hot drink so there we have it genoa's fascinating narrow alleys an interesting little girl and a sympathetic woman forget the rest the older sister played by willa holland is such a disgusting character that the fact that the young actress does a good job of being repellent is not exactly the kind of acting tribute she would like to hear i suspect the notion that this family go off to genoa to forget the unfortunate death of the mother is so trite that if we have another film like that all dead mothers have a right to complain at being exploited if michael winterbottom wanted to make a film about how interesting the old portion of genoa is why didn't he just go to the bbc and say he wanted to make a travel film with some mindless celebrity presenter why waste money on a feature film which is nothing but a vanity project of idle and meandering vacuity
<START> i had seen this film many years ago and it had made a lasting impression on me alas i have hardened to many films over the years and did not expect to be impressed by 'kalifornia' upon watching again recently i am pleased to say that it is every bit as unnerving and watchable as it was ten or so years ago br br there are two things which really give this movie its power the first is its cast we have a staggeringly disturbing turn by a young brad pitt as early grace knowing pitt as we all do as one of the most enduring heart throbs hollywood has ever had it is refreshing to see him play such a vile unattractive character pitt pulls the show off without resorting to white trash clichÃ© or parody and manages to remain genuinely terrifying throughout the movie br br juliette lewis is equally impressive as grace's tragic girlfriend playing the character like a ten year old girl with a forty year old's life experience lewis manages to evoke pity for her character's station in life as well as contempt for her naivety but she underpins her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by an actor so young personally i think it's a tragedy that neither pitt nor lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances here br br david duchovony and michelle forbes are both perfectly cast as the yuppy couple who unwittingly end up travelling across the us with pitt and lewis duchovony is aptly geeky and naive and forbes seems emphatically cynical and shut off but both actors manage to convincingly portray their characters' changes as they are equally intrigued repulsed and strangely attracted to pitt br br the fine casting and uniformly brilliant acting aside this film really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing at the time 'kalifornia' was released hollywood was releasing a slew of nice character turns out to be psychotic movies 'single white female' 'pacific heights' 'the hand that rocks the cradle' 'deceived' 'sleeping with the enemy' etc most of these movies followed the same formula the only variation being the nature of the relationship between good guy and bad guy 'kalifornia' doesn't really stray too far from this territory but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slow boil thriller and we are kept on the very edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn br br when the penny does drop and pitt is let loose to play the maniacal bad guy the film shifts gears completely and the last twenty minutes don't quite live up to rest of the movie that said the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable cold the fight is over but the scars will always be there br br much of the narration provided by a somewhat whiny pre x files duchovony is a tad contrived of course it's meant to be from the book the duchovony's journalist character has written so one could argue that the self conscious narration is meant to be a nod to the kind of sensationalised style in which most journalists write br br the film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90 of the thrillers of the past twenty years highly recommended but not for the weak of stomach or mind this film is disturbing on more than one level but then it's meant to be
<START> it is nice to see suraj barjatya back at what he is best at a story woven around a marriage it feels nice to have a movie in which there is no single scene which you would avoid watching with your family though the story is simple and does not contain any new elements you still like the movie because of the presentation performances and actually the over all treatment hats off to suraj the movie is about the fact that engagement leads to love the depiction of the changes in the way of thinking behaving once you get engaged is excellent director has definitely given it much thought and actors have done it to perfection though the movie is slow you don't mind it because you kind of get so much involved with the story that you just wanna continue watching the joy of this newly engaged couple as a typical rajshree stuff it has many sentimental scenes which are highly likely to make viewer burst into tears specially ladies but when you come out of the cinema hall you are very much satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth
<START> for some reason this film has never turned up in its original language in my neck of the woods despite owning the tcm uk cable channel which broadcasts scores of mgm titles week in week out more disappointingly it's still m i a on dvd Â even from warners' recently announced western classics collection box set which does include 3 other robert taylor genre efforts maybe they're saving it for an eventual signature collection devoted to this stalwart of mgm which may be coming next year in time for the 40th anniversary of his passingÂ br br i say this because the film allows him a rare villainous role as a selfish westerner with a fanatical hatred of indians and who opts to exploit his expert marksmanship by making some easy money hunting buffaloes an opening statement offers the alarming statistic that the population of this species was reduced from 60 000 000 to 3 000 in the space of just 30 years as an associate taylor picks on former professional of the trade stewart granger Â who rallies alcoholic peg legged lloyd nolan who continually taunts the irascible and vindictive taylor and teenage half breed russ tamblyn to this end as expected the company's relationship is a shaky one Â reminiscent of that at the centre of anthony mann's the naked spur 1953 another bleak open air mgm western the film in fact ably approximates the flavor and toughness of mann's work in this field despite being writer director brooks' first of just a handful of such outings but which cumulatively exhibited a remarkable diversity here too the narrative throws in a female presence debra paget also a half breed to be contended between the two rugged leads Â and granger like the james stewart of the naked spur returns to his job only grudgingly his remorse at having to kill buffaloes for mere sport and profit is effectively realized br br the latter also suffers in seeing taylor take paget for himself Â she bravely but coldly endures his approaches while secretly craving for granger Â and lets out his frustration on the locals at a bar while drunk taylor himself doesn't come out unscathed from the deal like the protagonist of the treasure of the sierra madre 1948 he becomes diffident and jealous of his associates especially with respect to a rare Â and therefore precious Â hide of a white buffalo they've caught he even goes buffalo crazy at one point as nolan had predicted becoming deluded into taking the rumble of thunder for the hooves of an approaching mass of the species the hunting scenes themselves are impressive Â buffaloes stampeding tumbling to the ground when hit the endless line up of the day's catch and the carcasses which subsequently infest the meadows the film's atypical but memorable denouement then is justly famous with winter in full swing a now paranoid taylor out for granger's blood lies in wait outside a cave in which the latter and paget have taken refuge to shoot him when granger emerges the next morning he discovers taylor in a hunched position Â frozen to death br br incidentally my father owns a copy of the hefty source novel of this by milton lott from the time of the film's original release actually he has collected a vast number of such editions Â it is after all a practice still in vogue Â where a book is re issued to promote its cinematic adaptation likewise for the record taylor and granger Â who work very well off each other here Â had already been teamed as sibling whale hunters in the seafaring adventure all the brothers were valiant 1953 Âwhich curiously enough is just as difficult to see in fact even more so considering that it's not even been shown on italian tv for what seems like ages
<START> i watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare and i have to say it did not deserve it br br parinda was so hyped that i was really looking forward to watch it br br parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good indian film makers despite having a great story it was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original it was loosely based on the classic on the waterfront br br anil kapoor was irritating especially when he comes from america the direction lacked quality many a times except a few in between scenes br br give this script to any of them ram gopal verma deepa mehta mahesh bhatt sudhir mishra and i'm 100 sure they'll make a mind blowing movie out of it br br i'm not saying parinda was bad it was just not good enough
<START> i read holes in 5th grade so when i heard they were doing a movie i was ecstatic of course being my busy self i didn't get chance to see the movie in theaters holes was at the drive in just out of town but alas we were just too busy i was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and not one of them had invited me they all said it was good but i've read great books that have made crappy movies so i was definately worried br br suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it came it was out that week and my parents were going on a cruise and i was left to babysit my sister who is 9 and i watched it and absolutely loved it i then took it to the other people i was babysitting's house and their kids 9 and 4 liked it too even my parents loved it and they're deffinately movie critics overall i recommend this movie is for anyone who understands family morale and and loves a hilarious cast this movie should be on your top 5 to see list
<START> the absolute summum of the oeuvre of that crafty dane douglas sirk born detlef sierck written on the wind compels our prurient attention in every gaudy frame from its justly famous opening sequence with the leaves blowing into the baronial foyer of a texas mansion and the wind riffling the pages of the calendar into a flashback the movie compresses into its 99 minutes all the familial intrigue that was to fuel such later little screen knockoffs as dallas dynasty and falcon crest over their years long runs br br the combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme americans in our dollar based society find irresistible brother and sister robert stack and dorothy malone are the spoiled troubled heirs to the hadly oil fortune boyhood chum rock hudson and new bride lauren bacall are the sane outsiders who try to keep the lid on the roiling cauldron it's been rumored that the story was based on libby holmann's marriage into reynolds tobacco money as always the misfits get all the scenery to chew and the best lines to spit out malone in her oscar nabbing performance as the boozing nymphomaniac with a jones for hudson gets to detonate a whole fireworks display of them hudson while good can't compete with all this over the top emoting bacall starts out strong but grows recessive a mere plot convenience no matter with a succession of set pieces shot in extravagant hues sirk gives an object lesson in how to turn out overwrought melodrama set in the lush consumer paradise of late 50s america nobody ever did it better
<START> this movie has made me upset when i think of cat in the hat im thinking of cat in the hat books you know the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children well i though that this movie would be a lot like that but much to my suprise was nothing like the books insted it is more like young adult humor movie in one part cat is talking to a gardening tool hoe cat talks to it like it is his hoe agin adult humor the naming of his car i all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie under the rating you'll find mild cude humor and some double entendres i think in short this means adult humor i wish i could return this movie wal mart said they wouldn't because the movie has been opened if you are thinking about buying this i suggest that maybe rent before you buy
<START> i believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles zvezda barely does the first zvezda being a russian war film i was expecting patriotism sentimentality beautiful poetic pictures a lush score slavic cheekbones and cruel germans what i didn't need was the naive love non affair the unrealistically silly war scenes and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a film which avoided carefully all historical or political references stalinism nazism holocaust only to end on a passing but nonetheless insulting to our sense of history endnote about liberating poland a missed opportunity as a film but not as propaganda apparently
<START> spoilers slow as molasses mummy movie involving this expiation in the valley of the kings in egypt that has to be aborted in order to keep the native population who are at the time revolting against british rule from finding out about it br br given the task of getting to this archaeological dig by his superiors british capt storm mark dana together with a couple of british soldiers and mrs sylvia quentin diane brewster the wife of the head man at the dig robert quentin george n neise make their way to the unearthed mummy's tomb on the way there capt storm sylvia and his men run into this desert like princess simira ziva rodann br br simira seems to be superhuman in her ability to withstand the rigors of desert life she doesn't drink water or get tired but also knows just what capt storm co are looking for and warns him and his group to stay as far away from the dig pharaoh's ra ha tet tomb as possible br br at ra ha tet's burial chamber robert quentin and his crew of archeologist's together with his egyptin guide simira's brother numar alvaro guillot already opened his tomb before capt storm can get there to stop them quentin violated ra ha tet's body by having dr farrady guy prescott cut his bandages this action on robert's and dr farrady's part has numar faint dead in his tracks it later turns out that numar somehow was possessed by ra ha tet's spirit or soul who took over his body and caused him to age at the rate of 500 years per hour to become himself a 3 000 year old mummy br br the movie has numar dressed in what looks like a pair of pajamas slinking around ra ha tet's tomb and it's surroundings attacking and sucking out the blood in order to survive like a vampire of anyone man or animal that he comes in contact with this blood sucking adventure by numar with him later losing his right arm goes on for some time until the by now crazed quentin trying to find the entrance you in fact thought that he already found it to ra ha tet's tomb get's himself killed is an indoor rock slide br br we learn at the end of the movie that numar to absolutely no one's surprise is actually ra ha tet reincarnated into another some 3 000 years later person or life numar's sister the mysterious and sexy simira is not only ra ha tet's sister since him and numar are really one and the same person but also the egyptian cat goddess babesti also not that hard to figure out br br with numar ra ha tet back in his tomb and all the deaths due the the pharaoh's curse now at an end capt storm sylvia and whatever is left of his men and the late robert quentin's archaeological expedition trek their way back to cairo and modern this in 1902 civilization the survivors of pharaoh ra ha tet curse keep what they found and unearthed only to themselves since no one would believe them anyway
<START> the flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser se7en ripoff there's really no reason to compare the two except maybe for the similar scenery in the final showdown br br now that that's out of the way i'll go into why the flock is very interesting in some respects mostly it's a drama piece rather than a full blown thriller about a very vigilant social worker who monitors sexual offenders at the very beginning you can clearly see his work has got the better of him evident in two scenes where first he's interviewing an offender and slaps him around and second when a woman tries to pick him up and all he can think of are his standard questions from his questionnaire br br gere is very good as errol babbage the aforementioned social worker his way of performing his job is not unlike that of a police officer he carries a gun and is constantly checking newspapers and supplies law officials with information if some of his flock may be responsible for a sexual crime he's also a person who's lost all happiness of living and his only relief seems to come from exacting his own vigilante justice on his flock twice you see him smile once when he's apologizing for treating his partner rudely and the other after he's beaten up a member of his flock br br as a suspense flick the flock isn't as successful somewhat confusing and with some irritating plot holes but it does have a number of striking set pieces br br overall the flock is a solid drama about a man performing a dehumanizing job and in the end he has to work hard to keep from being swallowed by the abyss he's surrounded himself in the world we live in is a pretty sick place and the further one can distance himself from the worst the happier that person is the flock gets that point across nicely
<START> i never saw the original 1954 version with judy garland so have no means of comparison also it's been some years but i found this tale neither gripping nor its romance captivating the movie tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are headed in opposite directions john norman howard is a worn out disillusioned rock star on the decline embarking upon a romance with a fresh talented new singing sensation esther hoffman her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline br br the lead actors kris kristofferson and barbra streisand are adequate in their roles but neither their chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me the film is noteworthy to me for only one aspect streisand's beautiful rendition of the oscar winning song 'evergreen' she truly has a powerful and magnificent voice
<START> this flick is sterling example of the state of erotic b movies bad porn movies without the hardcore sex the plot in this one isn't so bad as these things go it involves a female lawyer trying to prove her lover is innocent of killing his wife the rest of the movie however leaves something to be desired bad acting bad direction bad looking woman bad sets bad cinematography bad sound and bad sex scenes the filmmakers should learn the difference between raunchy and erotic they don't even have the common sense to have gabriella hall naked or in a love scene br br how dumb is that
<START> 50 years old this musical comedy fantasy might look its age but it wears it with dignity br br this film is still great fun crosby was never really romantic lead material but he delivers the material with the lightly humorous edge it needs bendix plays broad and is huge fun in a part which calls upon his strengths hardwicke how joyous for a knight of the realm a genuine one to throw himself into caperings like this with such abandon and rhonda fleming enjoys herself in the least showy of the main roles only murvyn vye disappoints as an unconvincing merlin br br though not a musical the songs are very good and the dance routine accompanying busy doing nothing is perfect funny appropriate dexterous without being challenging and making a virtue out of crosby's musical movement which let's be fair was inherently amusing due ti its never being his greatest strength br br the colour is fine the sound is a little muddy in places br br and the story well it takes some liberties with the original but i suspect that mr clemens might well have been pleased with the result
<START> this movie is the perfect illustration of how not to make a sci fi movie the worst tendency in sci fi is to make your theme an awful sophomoric pseudo orwellian huxleyan whateverian vision of the human future br br science fiction filmmakers and authors as geeks take themselves very seriously given the high crap to good stuff ratio of their genre i think other genres with a high ctgsr yes i just made it up relax like horror or action or even romantic comedy seem to have a little better grasp of the fact that they are not changing the world with some profound message br br sci fi can certainly be successful on a serious level as numerous great filmmakers have proven but there is an immense downside to the whole concept which is represented by robot jox with its low rent construction of the future lone good design element the bizarre slick looking billboard ads all over the place that encourage women to have more babies and its painfully heavy handed iliad parallels he's named achilles for god's sake i actually didn't pick up on this until i saw the film for like the tenth time but i went to public school so the filmmakers are not exonerated br br of course if you're a crazy movie freak like me this downside has a great upside i absolutely love movies like this because bad movies are quite often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones it's kind of a lester bangs approach to movie viewing i guess br br note the lead in this movie gary graham is that his name i refuse to go check is really not that bad he makes a go of it he's kind of cool especially when he's drunk hung over
<START> i saw the last five or ten minutes of this film back in 1998 or 1999 one night when i was channel surfing before going to bed and really liked what i saw since then i've been on the lookout scouring tv listings flipping through dvd vhs racks at stores but didn't find a copy until recently when i found out some internet stores sold it then being a world class procrastinator i still didn't order it finally i found a dvd copy in a circuit city while visiting portland or a few weeks ago then it only took me about a month after returning home before sitting down and watching it br br so what do i think about the film it's good not as good as i remembered and hoped for but still well worth the 9 99 it cost me after seeing the whole film for the first time i rate it as a 7 10 with potential to become an 8 10 i'll have to be less sleepy then and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to catch some dialogue
<START> john schlesinger's 'midnight cowboy' is perhaps most notable for being the only x rated film in academy history to receive the oscar for best picture this was certainly how i first came to hear of it and to be completely honest i didn't really expect much of the film this is not to say that i thought it would be horrible but somehow i didn't consider it the sort of movie that i would enjoy watching this is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners Â a remarkable combination of stellar acting ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack everybody's talking' at me i don't hear a word they're sayin' make this film one of the finest explorations of life naivety and friendship ever released br br young joe buck then newcomer jon voight dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy travels from texas to new york to seek a new life as a hustler a male prostitute women however do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services and joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up during these exploits joe comes to meet enrico ratso rizzo dustin hoffman a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con joe out of all his money when they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament ratso offers joe a place to stay and working together they attempt to make largely dishonest lives for themselves in the cold gritty metropolis of new york br br joe had convinced himself that new york women would be more than willing to pay for sex however his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman sylvia miles twenty dollars though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent ratso is just as naÃ¯ve as joe ratso with his painful limp and hacking cough is always assuring himself that if only he could travel to the warmth of miami somehow everything would be all right this misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of lennie and george of john steinbeck's classic novel 'of mice and men ' br br shot largely on the streets of new york 'midnight cowboy' is a grittily realistic look at life in the slums watching the film we can almost feel ourselves inside ratso's squalid unheated residence our joints stiff from the aching winter cold the acting certainly contributes to this ultra realism with both voight and hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society hoffman in particular is exceptional in his role i'm walkin' here i'm walkin' here managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much lauded debut in 1967's 'the graduate ' both stars were later nominated for best actor oscars also nominated for acting Â bafflingly Â was sylvia miles for an appearance that can't have been for more than five minutes though both ultimately lost out to john wayne in 'true grit ' 'midnight cowboy' eventually went on to win three oscars from seven nominations including best picture best director for schlesinger and best writing for waldo salt br br 'midnight cowboy' is told mainly in a linear fashion though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at joe's past rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about the audience is invited to think about it for themselves and how these circumstances could have led joe onto the path he is now pursuing the achingly beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope but a large amount of uncertainty gritty thought provoking and intensely fascinating 'midnight cowboy' is one for the ages
