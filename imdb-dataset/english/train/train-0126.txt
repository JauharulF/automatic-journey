<START> first off the title character is not even the main character of the movie he is the sidekick of the cult leader the actor who portrays igor believed that screaming loud laughing hysterically and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people igor also had the annoying habit of yelling because he never actually just spoke in a high pitched voice he would also say idiotic one liners for example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw igor upon seeing this yells out paul no paul why'd you do it i could have cut her clean so clean in another scene igor tells a victim that she would have to 'get her own tools for surgery because right now it was his time to operate ' aside from the bad acting the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax which is igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining 'good guys' the movie offers no explanation of this only telling the viewer that igor escaped from the mental hospital what bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie i wish i could get back the moments i lost watching this
<START> kris kristofferson at his drugged out peak in the mid 70s finds himself barely able to squeeze on to the screen alongside la streisand's humongous ego and discount store feminism br br none of the characters are really likable i was so glad when kristofferson's ferrari went over that hill and crashed br br if you want to see a good movie about rock and roll stardom try the buddy holly story made only about a year and a half after this dreck
<START> this bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie this installment tries to veer away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke but it takes a wrong turn and journeys nowhere interesting or funny br br there's almost a half hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert and lots of people watching on free tv since when does that happen surely the script writer could have done something more creative look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation not in this film which pretty much ended the bill ted franchise the joke was over br br the grim reaper is tossed into the mix for whatever reason this infusion like the whole plot is done poorly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement there's a zz top impression hammered in for no reason there's lights smoke mirrors noise but nothing really creative or funny br br skip this bogus thing
<START> i make a point out of watching bad movies frequently and the sci fi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find as such i'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when i saw sands of oblivion the acting was uncharacteristically sub par as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display sci fi usually has in store for us there are a few cameos made by people you'd most likely recognize although you may not know their names by heart the cgi special effects are minimal and as such one of the largest sources of comedy in a sci fi feature is lacking sure there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl he's known for a couple of days but overall it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter and i consider that a major disappointment br br if i was rating it on a 10 star scale made specifically to judge made for tv movies i'd probably give it a 4 maybe even a 5 a real shame that i may have to wait 'till the next sci fi original movie to get a good laugh and i really hope that this movie isn't part of some overall quality increase in sci fi original movies
<START> i tried to remove anything that might be considered a spoiler i also assume that you've seen the first movie or at least know the general gist so if you haven't some of this might not make sense br br plot this movie beats the audience over the head with tired philosophical ramblings again and again in an attempt to get the theme across we are bombarded again and again by questions of purpose and destiny and choice and forced to endure the long torturous platitude sessions that contain them br br neo awakened from a dream in the last movie now begins a period of realization about his own existence there are a lot of revelations in this movie which i'll be vague about so they won't seem like spoilers br br if you're still worried vague references will spoil the movie don't read the paragraph below br br the strength and weakness of faith is revealed the strengths and weaknesses of love and its temporary nature are also revealed the interdependence of humans and technology and our faith in technology are also revealed the importance of choice and experience is revealed explaining further things that are revealed would go into too much detail so i will refrain as the guidelines for writing a commentary asks btw by revealed i mean pounded through our ears and eyes like nails br br storyline so how does neo and the gang get from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next one in short they keep the faith and use and abuse overly stylized action and bullet time like it's going out of style and after this display i'm hoping movie goers and makers alike learn to appreciate subtlety and originality a bit more more on that later to not spoil anything i will say no more than the promo material already did neo is still trying to figure out the matrix and he is looking for answers while trying to save the humans and zion all while baddies are going after him and his cohorts the movie pretty much picks up where the last one left off br br action while martial arts action and gunplay peppered its predecessor in somewhat equal parts this movie focuses much more on martial arts than gunplay adding swords sais etc to the mix special effects are so often used and waved in the audience's face that it becomes really tiresome i've discussed this movie with friends and coworkers alike and nearly all of them found some of the action sequences especially the smith fight we all heard would be in the movie to be too long and tedious this is a huge red flag for action fans because the end of an action sequence should either leave you wanting a slight bit more or completely content with the awesomeness that just occured br br these fights scenes do neither they are over stylized over the top sequences that are wooden and uninspired in the first movie there was a real sense of desperation to some of the action a sense that fighting was for survival not just looking good which i honestly don't think they manage in reloaded anyway in black and leather go watch drunken master or iron monkey after this movie to remind yourself of what good fighting sequences are you won't regret it in addition the matrix abilities people have in reloaded is not consistent and what they actually do is not consistent the first movie had its inconsistencies here but they weren't too glaring unlike reloaded br br special effects are poured on and on and on every little thing someone does be it just jump somersault spin and in many cases just pose are br br slow moed bullet timed or over accentuated by some sort of destruction it's evident the w bros had a ton of money to throw at this movie and boy did they throw it with no real restraint sharp editors could have really helped this but the first movie was such a hit that free reign was obviously given which brings us to br br character and dialogue i have already more or less said the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical platitudes actors can't really bring a lot of depth to their character when the script and direction is shoving character progression audience's face or neglecting it altogether the audience is at no time given nuance and substance so they can contemplate the character on their own br br keanu's acting performance is stiff at best keanu is good at acting confused and that's about all he does in this film he makes a decent attempt to show passion between neo and trinity but it falls flat br br lawrence tries to make morpheus everything from moses to henry v and be as cool as a cat throughout with the script he is provided he makes a noble attempt but it also falls flat br br moss isn't very believable either her look of concern is always the same much like keanu's and the chemistry isn't there although in their very physical scenes they fake it well enough br br hugo once again brought his weird sense of being an agent program but he too suffered from the script's hand i actually find him to be the most interesting character of the bunch but instead of development they just make him an excuse for a huge drawn out fight scene br br all in all this movie is beyond disappointing if you had good expectations and on its own as a stand alone movie which is not how it's supposed to be taken it's still horrible i don't see the matrix as deep but i at least see it as an enjoyable scifi romp that has some interesting ideas good action a few funny lines and enough restrained symbolism and elusions to amuse the attentive reloaded fails on all these counts and i really hope the w bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment granted i don't have a lot of hope left for that after this film
<START> below average movie with poor music considering a movie based on music ordinary script direction with full of blunders salman khan was at his usual acting ajay's performance deteriorating with time as his looks especially his styles as a rock star were pathetic asin was just a showpiece only overall i felt like wasting my money in cinema salman khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to aamir khan there were many songs in the movie all boring except man ko ati the most important song to impress the uk music sponsor was most unimpressive khanabadosh can be very easily understood by an english music sponsor the other movie i saw last week was wake up sid which was simple slow love story with good direction acting despite average music
<START> the film belongs to inventor underdog genre jake gyllenhaal laura dern and chris cooper bring a little acting verve to story with several standard elements well filmed well edited with plenty of well acted secondary roles br br some have declared this movie to be classic american hokey it is that and more i agree with those who say the movie celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration br br the film is a pleasant reminder that achievement may be born of ordinary roots br br
<START> just imagine what school would have been like in a world like this the kids are one big gang who have really good taste in music and unite against bad headmasters and teachers rock 'n' roll high school is taking place in that world it's like a ramones record coming to life the characters are all as silly innocent and charming as the ramones' songs and the music itself is of course fantastic high school comedies have really changed over the years if you compare a movie like american pie with this late 70's classic where no tasteless sex jokes are made at all since a remake is apparently in the works it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will get lost along the way and will get replaced by vulgar half funny dick jokes as bill hicks used to call them however the main problem will be that the ramones cannot be replaced they were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even come close to taking their place so the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone as quirky and charming as it is gabba gabba hey
<START> this is an excellent but hard to find trippy world war i spy thriller in the inimitable 60's italian style from the psychedelic graphics of the introductory credits and the great score by ennio morricone to the lesbian love scene with capucine and the elaborately produced apocalyptic no man's land battle scenes with poison gas and german cavalry in full gas proof 'storm trooper' gear this is a movie that should not be missed it is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the ruthlessness of the players on and off the battlefield apart from the battle scenes some of the production and special effects are primitive apparently because the bulk of the budget for this movie was saved for the battle scenes but for lovers of 60's cinema it should not be an issue i first saw this movie on television many years ago and had the foresight to tape it on vhs i still have the tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time
<START> a town called hell aka a town called bastard a british spanish co production was made on the heels of clint eastwood's success in the italian made man with no name trilogy the template used in most of these films was to hire recognizable american actors whose careers were largely in decline and dub their voices this film is no exception except for the fact that they used some british actors as well br br it's difficult to summarize the plot but here goes the story opens with rebels or whatever led by robert shaw and marin landau raiding a church and killing everyone inside including the priest fast forward to the subject town a few years later where the shaw character is masquerading as a priest the mayor of the town telly savalas is a brutal leader who thinks nothing of meting out justice with his gun br br throw into the mix a grieving widow alvira stella stevens who is searching for her husband's killer add to this the fact that she rides around in a hearse lying dead like in a coffin for god knows why after the mayor is murdered by his henchman la bomba al lettieri the town is invaded by a federale colonel landau in search of a rebel leader i'm sorry but the name escapes me the colonel takes over the town and begins summarily executing the townsfolk to force them to reveal the identity of the leader br br even though they opened the film side by side its difficult to tell from the dialog that the landau and shaw characters know each other a blind man fernando rey claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face he does so and br br i'm sure the principals regretted making this film it's just plain awful and well deserving of my dreaded 1 rating shaw spends most of the film fixating his trademark stare at whomever is handy even landau can't salvage this film the beautiful ms stevens is totally wasted here too having just made peckinpah's the ballad of cable hogue the previous year i found it odd that she would appear in this mess of a movie savalas made several of these pictures pancho villa and horror express come to mind during he pre kojak period michael craig is also in it somewhere as a character called paco br br fernando rey appeared in many of these westerns although he would emerge to play the villain in the two french connection films al lettieri would also emerge with a role in the godfather 1972 and go on to other memorable roles before his untimely death in 1975 br br in all fairness the version i watched ran only 88 minutes rather than the longer running times of 95 or 97 minutes listed on imdb however i can't see where an extra 7 or 8 minutes would make much difference br br avoid this one
<START> casomai was the last movie i've seen before getting married just last year br br it was also the first movie i've searched for after i was married because we promised to offer a copy to our priest br br sometimes reality is not that apart from fiction to all those who wrote that priests like don camillo don't exist in real life i would recommend them to visit my priest pe nuno westwood in estoril portugal br br to all others i would only recommend them to see this movie before and after the i do day br br rodrigo ribeiro portugal
<START> this movie is bufoonery and i loved it the dragon lord jacky chan and his buddy cowboy totally made the movie fun meaningful and just plain silly the movie is a rare blend of a good vs evil fight and somehow the wonders and fun that is growing up long shao ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young dragon lord so named because he is the son of a wealthy family and cowboy which include implementing clever elaborate ways to escape studying with the help of the entire household including the tutor competing in rather boyish and idiotically interesting ways to gain the affection of a local girl competing in soccer you will see what i mean and the list goes on somehow they find themselves in the midst of a fight to save the a shipment of valuable antiques and the lives of several people br br the movie has its serious moments but they do not depress but rather inspire the playfulness of the boys are not lost in this exchange but is actually employed against evil what i really loved about this movie is how it ends not the typical confrontation which in itself was awesome but well you'll see let me just say it truly captures the spirit of the movie br br silly witty meaningful and nostalgic great movie
<START> i thought rachel york was fantastic as lucy i have seen her in kiss me kate and victor victoria as well and in each of these performances she has developed very different and very real characterizations she is a chameleon who can play and sing anything br br i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachel's performance in lucy even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn't really look like lucy my response to that is so what i wasn't looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown and rachel certainly gave us that in great depth i also didn't want to see someone simply doing classic lucy routines therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits vitameatavegamin and the candy factory it seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits this approach i thought gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated the professor and the grape stomping in particular there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel's mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having i couldn't believe she was able to capture that and so naturally br br i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of i love lucy throughout the entire movie after all those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge given the right set of circumstances lucy didn't fit the mold of the old studio system in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts br br i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy drama wit sadness anger passion love ambition loyalty sexiness self absorption childishness and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing lucy was a star turn for rachel york i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future i also hope it brings her an emmy
<START> there have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that i really liked this was not one of them br br it was overacted and used camera techniques that made me feel like i was watching a soap opera it was ludicrously predictable and took most of the movie to get going then left you asking that's it once i decided not to take the movie too seriously and watch it from a purely corny point of view it became more enjoyable this is one movie that would have wound up on mst3000 if it was still on
<START> when we started watching this series on cable i had no idea how addictive it would be even when you hate a character you hold back because they are so beautifully developed you can almost understand why they react to frustration fear greed or temptation the way they do it's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of christopher's learning curves br br i can't understand why adriana would put up with christopher's abuse of her verbally physically and emotionally but i just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior carmella has a dream house endless supply of expensive things but i'm sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband or maybe not that's why i watch br br it doesn't matter how many times you watch an episode you can find something you missed the first five times we even watch episodes out of sequence watch season 1 on late night with commercials but all the language a e with language censored reruns on the movie network whenever they're on we're there we've been totally spoiled now br br i also love the malaprop's an albacore around my neck is my favorite of johnny boy when these jewels have entered our family vocabulary it is a sign that i should get a life i will when the series ends and i have collected all the dvd's and put the collection in my will
<START> band camp was awful the naked mile was a little better and this third straight to dvd in the american pie franchise seems the same quality as the predecessor basically erik stifler john white split from his girlfriend after losing his virginity and now him and mike 'cooze' coozeman jake siegel are joining erik's cousin dwight steve talley at college with the promise of many parties plenty of booze and enough hot chicks at the beta house they only have fifty listed tasks to carry out to become official privileged members but a threat comes into sight with the rivals gek geek house led by power hungry nerd and sheep shagger edgar tyrone savage offering bigger and better than what beta have to settle it once and for all beta and gek go into battle with the banned for forty years greek games to beat each other in with the loser moving out the last champion of the games noah levenstein aka jim's dad the only regular eugene levy runs the show which sees the people unhooking bras a gladiator duel floating on water catching a greased pig russian roulette in the mouth with cartridges of aged horse spunk wife carrying and drinking a full keg of alcohol with puking not disqualifying it all comes to the sudden death with a guy getting stripper lap dancing and they have to resist cumming beta house win when edgar cums with a girl dressed as a sheep on his lap also starring flubber's christopher mcdonald as mr stifler meghan heffern as ashley dan petronijevic as bull nic nac as bobby christine barger as margie italia ricci as laura johnson moshana halbert as sara coleman sarah power as denise andreja punkris as stacy and jordan prentice as rock the nudity amount is very slightly increased as is the grossness of the jokes and i could guess it being rated one star out of five but i like it adequate
<START> most people who chase after movies featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand that amelie was a character it is not really audrey tautou's real life personality hence every movie she partakes in is not going to be amelie part 2 part 3 etc br br now with that said i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it yes it's true there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn't seen at all for maybe 45 min but i didn't even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters the guy who lies about everything is too funny the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss actually getting into all the characters here could take quite a while but this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while br br audrey tautou's character irene is not the overdone sugary girl that amelie was in fact as irene her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first in this film irene is a girl with good intentions but over the course of a very awful day her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic br br what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building very entertaining to watch great scenery and shots very colorful and never too slow and all of the characters can actually act the best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense and the whole butterfly effect blossoms i swear it was the best 20 minutes of film i've seen in quite a while and the ending it made me think damn i really lucked out finding this movie the ending to this movie is top notch whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant because not only are there all these other subplots going on but to somehow make them all tie in together and in a sensible manner which is the case here but also to make each character feel human and come alive not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect very impressive br br i highly suggest this movie as it's a great film to watch anytime in any mood with any company or alone
<START> i'm not quite sure why but this movie just doesn't play the way it should it should be humerous and fun but instead is just boring i think a large part of it is because they way over played the gadgets the old cartoon it is based on is much better br br 3 10
<START> although i like kurt vonnegut i'm not particularly interested in spy stories and i didn't know this one the only reason i watched it was nick nolte who is one of my favorite actors since i saw breakfast of champions and hotel rwanda but the film brought me a pleasant surprise of course nolte was great but so was the plot there was relatively little political intrigue and much more focus on the moral question by reading his anti semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to americans he in fact contributed to the general attitude of germans and as it later turns out americans towards jews or hitler which carries more weight his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti semitism the dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken not even as narration howard campbell jr nolte is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up not even in his memoirs the inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray but with the help of excellent acting and photography this film manages br br there are other points to it such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichÃ©s like the song white christmas that make it real different from average american movies i recommend it to everyone who is bored with hollywood spy movies
<START> i unknowingly had this movie on my shelf for a while in a mill creek collection and one night i just decided to watch it though not expecting much as the beginning credits roll around i'm surprised to discover this film was made under the filmirage company filmirage brought the world such amazing stinkers as troll 2 ator the invincible and quest for the mighty sword so i was compelled to watch br br as the movie started out it had potential to be pretty decent even though it was unoriginal the gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent but after a while into the film the pace started dragging and i found myself thinking okay someone better get killed soon or someone better mutate at the onset of this drag when i was having these thoughts though someone may have gotten killed or have mutated however as noted the gore and effects weren't very good what made matters worse was that the scene transitions were confusing example first dr houseman would be at the zoo then he'd have a flash back about possibly killing someone finally he'd wake up in a cold sweat in bed making the audience ask was he dreaming he was at the zoo like the movie's pace these scene transitions got progressively worse br br i could try to say the character development of dr houseman was pretty good but towards the end of the film that is once you've seen what the doctor has metamorphosed into hopefully you'll laugh which really is the only reason to see this movie at least once this movie unintentionally runs like a long winded joke br br the costume of the um thing that doctor houseman becomes can also be seen in joe d' amato's quest for the mighty sword which was made in the same year you've gotta love filmirage movies they're always re using the same stuff
