<START> there's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets it's just that some are better than others this is very poor the acting is awful the script dire and the special effects overrated br br why does hollywood treat it's audience with such contempt and why have they made a sequel
<START> this movie has several things going for it it is a feel good story the characters and actors are likable realistic and present fine performances most important i believe is that dennis quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball robert redford looked good both throwing and swinging a bat in the natural and so did kevin costner in for love of the game and bull durham in major league tom berenger and charlie sheen looked like they knew what they were doing but many of the others did not and that picture was pure silliness and not very funny br br so many earlier baseball movies even where the stories might be interesting presented such a lack of baseball ability on the part of the leads they were ludicrous in this respect in the stratton story and strategic air command jimmy stewart looked about as believable as a professional baseball player as your overweight non athletic elderly uncle in the softball game at the family reunion other virile and physically robust stars e g gary cooper as lou gehrig robald reagan as grover cleveland alexander and dan dailey as dizzy dean also exhibited a degree of baseball ability that would put them in the late rounds while choosing up for a game at the sunday picnic even if coed and even if your uncle were involved br br the scenes of quaid's high school team he coached the ones where he attends his tryout with the devil rays and those with him playing in two minor leagues and in the american league all ring true the participants are believable and capable in addition he is an engaging actor who always delivers a talented and appropriate characterization except to a degree some of his over the top scenes and his forced accent in his portrayal of jerry lee lewis but he's definitely on target here and this movie is a 9 as good or better as any others of this genre except for the natural
<START> i found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis when leo the oldest announces that he is hiv the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was touching and yet strange br br i have never seen a family that was as physically demonstrative as this one nor one as likely to shout at each other i didn't understand why the family felt that youngest couldn't deal with the news but once past that difficult i found this a thoroughly moving film br br
<START> peaches is truly a marvelous film i write this to refute a review from someone called 'auscrit' that has appeared on this site first of all the idea that either monahans first film 'the interview' is somehow tv is an extraordinary statement here is a film that has been significantly praised around the world as is simply one of the best australian films ever made it fully deserved to win best picture peaches is a brave bold and courageous departure for me it works on every level and i have now seen it twice monahan is a filmmaker who is demonstrating great skill and incredible sensitivity for 'auscrit' to make the comment that it is another tv movie etc and that hugo weaving is no good simply does not 'get' the film or more particularly does not want to get it frankly it is the sort of comment that one expects from either another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both or someone from inside the industry either distribution exhibition or bureaucracy your average punter i have found just does not write comments like that i have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film sommersault one has to wonder what people think they are looking at unfortunately in australia at the time ss was released the push was if you did not like it then there was something wrong with you not the film this manipulation of the media is pretty common down under the reality is the only similarity between the two films are that they are rights of passage films unfortunately for me ss is a film about nothing that could have been told in 15 minutes i see it as a one dimensional film about anxiety peaches in comparison is a master piece personally i cannot wait to what monahan does next as he is clearly way ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema in conclusion if the film does not win all at this years afi's and if awards then it is a rigged game as for auscrit please find something more constructive do with your time
<START> me my boyfriend and our friend watched this movie if thats what u wanna call it and we agree with the last person but we were stupid and bought the damn thing we thought it really was about diablo so we bought it br br we hate it really suxz so beware do not buy this thing they call a movie br br we would return it but don't no if anybody would want this stupid movie br br oh and another thing the shouldn't call it the legend of diablo they should of called it legend of azar br br and this movie is rated r this should not of even been not rated br br we think that diablo would be crying his eyes out laughing at this stupid movie br br this is a movie that would have been done by a church br br theses actors are never gonna become nothing because this movie
<START> sherman set the wayback machine for 1986 the united states was just climbing out of its worst postwar recession while japan was enjoying an unprecedented industrial boom manufacturing industries were still a significant part of the us economy and factory workers were a good example of the average american the word downsizing hadn't entered the general vocabulary yet but everyone knew the phenomenon bruce could be heard on the radio singing foreman says these jobs are going boy and they ain't coming back to your hometown chrysler had just been bailed out by uncle sam bumper stickers could be seen saying buy american the job you save may be your own br br gung ho does a better job of capturing the mood of the american industrial workforce than just about any other popular movie made during that period certainly the movie has its flaws some loose plot threads and mediocre acting jobs by everyone except michael keaton and gedde watanabe but the story really is about the meeting of east and west keaton's hunt stevenson personifies america brash and confident on the outside yet insecure underneath watanabe's kazuhiro personifies japan on top of the heap with a successful system but wondering if there is more to be learned from their western rivals the movie's plot flawed as it is simply provides a framework for the conflict and eventually synthesis of their two personalities br br keaton's acting overshadows everyone else's and practically makes the movie by itself i've always admired keaton for his ability to deliver lines that feel improvised no matter what script he's following his character hunt stevenson is a likable affable everyman a natural leader with a wise ass streak but he has a fatal flaw common to many of us he doesn't want to disappoint anyone he'll distract the crowd with inspirational anecdotes and even lie rather than point out the ugly truth br br kazuhiro is the mirror image of stevenson shy and introspective but also because of his japanese upbringing reluctant to be the bearer of bad news the scene in which stevenson first comes to kazuhiro with the employees' grievances captures perfectly the japanese approach to workplace conflict kazuhiro replies to stevenson's complaints with i understand what you are saying but won't refuse his requests out loud stevenson misinterprets this as agreement and goes away saying okay we've got that settled this is still a problem in japanese american business relations in the 21st century br br ultimately kazuhiro and stevenson have the same problem get the factory working smoothly meet production goals and fulfill their responsibility to the workers under them in working towards this goal they each have to take a page from the others' book kazuhiro's family becoming more americanized is an obvious example also note that stevenson thinks it's odd when kazuhiro explains how he had to make a public apology to his workers for failing them and yet later in the movie stevenson does exactly that himself br br the plot and its resolution are a little cornball but hey this is a comedy if you can overlook the movie's flaws there is a great story about self realization and open mindedness here
<START> right at this moment i am watching this movie for the second time on television and for the second time i fell into it when it was running for an hour already i think i saw 2 minutes more this time this movie is really impressing the way goldsworthy looks at nature changes nature in a way that you yourself would never think of really is amazing this whole movie gives you a warm feeling seeing him play with the world around him with such love or only seeing his hands covered in dirt and with broken fingernails it just touches you
<START> i will never forget the night i saw this movie we were on a submarine on patrol in the north atlantic and this was the scheduled movie of the evening we all gave up after the second reel they did not even try to show it at the mid night showing opting for a rerun instead this is all i really have to say but they have this stupid rule that my comment must contain ten lines i'm not supposed to pad the comment with random words so i will just continue to ramble until i get my ten lines of bs i could not find george goble listed in the credits but i remember him in the movie the sining was terrible and the songs even worse
<START> the truth is that a film based on a harold robbins novel is not going to win any awards this is no exception the lonely lady is a pure b picture in budget cast and execution technically it looks like a made for tv film the acting is very uneven joseph cali is especially terrible anthony holland is an embarrassment as one reviewer said of a certain katherine hepburn performance her range goes from a to b ms zedora manages to get to g the rest of the cast is solid and wasted in their respective roles lloyd bochner and bibi besch deserved better still the whole thing can be a great deal of fun in a trashy sort of way as befits robbins everything revolves around sex and nudity if you're looking for some fun and you're not too sober this could be for you
<START> freddy's dead the final nightmare starts as dream demon freddy krueger robert englund leaves a teenager shon greenblatt on the outskirt's of springwood with no memory of himself who he is or why he is there the local police pick him up take him to a youth centre where child psychiatrist maggie burroughs lisa zane interviews him she finds a newspaper cutting in his pocket which leads the two to elm street in springwood where they discover that no children live there therefore no victims for freddy kill anyone it all turns out that it's an elaborate plan by freddy to find his daughter use her to escape springwood when maggie realises what freddy is up to her some kids decide they have to kill freddy once for all br br directed by rachel talalay this was made with the intention of being the final a nightmare on elm street film which by this time had reached five of course as any horror film fan know's if there's still money to be made from a franchise or a character then there's no way in hell freddy's dead the final nightmare was going to be the last one which of course it wasn't the a nightmare on elm street series has been a franchise of diminishing returns as the films dropped in quality as the series progressed until we got here freddy's dead the final nightmare which for my money is probably the worst out of the lot of them the film moves at a reasonable pace it's rarely boring but it's so silly childish feels like some sort of live action cartoon with some awful set piece horror scenes that seem a million miles from wes craven's suspenseful effective early 80's original the sequence where stoner spencer is trapped inside a video game being played by freddy is terrible on it's own but then we are treated to shots of his body back in reality bouncing around the house from wall to wall floor to ceiling which is quite the most ridiculous thing i've seen in a while or maybe the early scenes when the john doe kid falls from a plane down to the ground just like the coyote cartoon character in the road runner cartoons or the absurd sight of freddy threatening the deaf carlos with pins that he intends to drop to the floor to make a loud noise or when he eventually kills him by scraping his knives across a blackboard you can't take this seriously i was just sitting there not quite believing what i was seeing when they do finally try to kill freddy the hero is given a secret powerful special weapon yeah that's right a pair of cardboard 3 d glasses the character's are poor the dialogue is poor the plot is confusing it doesn't really stick to the elm street continuity overall the film is a bit of a mess the best thing i can say about it is that it has quite a bit of unintentional humour you can certainly laugh at it br br the film has major tonal problems as it tries to be dark scary sinister yet it's so silly simply looks ridiculous at times that any attempt at being serious falls completely flat there's not much gore in this one there's some cut off fingers some stabbings someone falls on a bed of nails that's about it the body count is extremely low here with only three death's the final twenty or so minutes of freddy's dead the final nightmare was in fact shot in 3 d although the version i saw presented this part as normal so i can't comment on how well this does or doesn't work but you can definitely see shots which are meant to be seen in 3 d which take advantage of the process the special effects vary some are quite good actually while other's are terrible freddy's burnt make up this time looks quite poor br br this apparently had a budget of about 5 000 000 it had an opening weekend box office take of 12 000 000 the film has a few nice visual touches gags which makes the thing feel even more cartoony than it already is the acting is really poor from the main leads although there are a few odd cameos including tom arnold roseanne johnny depp rocker alice cooper br br freddy's dead the final nightmare is probably the worst of the entire series apart from some unintentional laugh value there's not much here to recommend or enjoy fans of the series will probably like it defend it but for me this is about as far from wes craven's original classic shocker as it gets followed by new nightmare 1994 which tried to take freddy krueger the series in a new different direction
<START> lulu louise brooks works as a typist and is missing something in her life she enters a miss france contest against the wishes of her boyfriend andre georges charlia and she wins she sets off for the miss europe title leaving her boyfriend behind she wins again but returns home to andre because he has asked her to once back together her life becomes mundane again so one night she writes a note to him and leaves to experience the fame that is waiting for her as miss europe andre follows her br br this film is a silent film with a piano music track all the way through it is also sped up so everything seems fast limited dialogue has been added on afterwards and it is very phony the cast are alright bearing in mind that it is a silent film the best part of the film comes at the end but the story goes on a little too long after watching this i'm not really sure what the big deal was over the looks of louise brooks she has a terrible haircut that makes her face look fat i don't need to watch it again
<START> let me get the bad out of the way first james hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their delivery br br that said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes i am an english guy from london but i love new york and have visited many many times before and after september 11th it is a second home to me and i can't help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city this is the real deal in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them i am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day it is a shame that they didn't use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was br br conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way
<START> okay just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie well at least i did it started out good but became so boring after the first half hour spoiler br br it tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants the only problem is that her daughter's friend is the girl in the way she always wins the competitions therefore pushing the mother further towards eliminating her after talking to a hitman the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit so actions are taken but she eventually gets caught br br the cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening don't waste your time watching this br br
<START> a flying saucer manned literally by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a 'forbidden planet ' what they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman and her father a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in br br on the surface this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery some compare it to shakespeare's tempest but this is a stretch and in some ways an insult to the scifi genre stripped of what makes it a scifi film sure its the tempest but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about br br underneath this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like star trek br br anne francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful the special effects and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable if it were not for the goofy retro art deco ness of 1950s sci fi props you might think you were watching a 1960s piece br br this is a classic of that very special sub genre of sci fi i like to call 1950s sci fi and though not in my opinion the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci fi film and special effects the clever plot now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of star trek lost in space and even farscape is worth paying attention to and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of star trek's original series aired about 12 years later though they may find themselves disappointed by the relatively mild 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration while i do not mean to nitpick the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem i had with it br br some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young good looking leslie nielsen in one of his first starring roles unfortunately nielsen's performance is only average and at times down right poor especially at the climax of the film walter pigeon though quite excellent in other films over acts his role as well ms francis earl holliman and the amazing robby the robot are the stand out actors in this crowd though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job the problems with the featured performances i think are as much the fault of the director and the editor as anything though they certainly got most of the film quite right
<START> i have two very major complaints regarding this film br br 1 that my local rental store shelved what is very clearly a soft core porn in the suspense category had i known what it was i would not have wasted my time renting it in the first place and yes this movie is a soft core porn br br 2 the title has nothing to do with the movie no one in this movie does anything that is either deviant or obsessive let alone a combination of the two br br actually make that three major complaints br br 3 that i for some reason watched the movie long enough to discover point number two on this list boy do i regret that stay away from this movie learn from my mistake this movie is valueless on virtually every level
<START> i have to congratulate the genius who approved this one edward furlong you're not as good as you think mate you can't grab on every piece of low cost amateur crap which sole intention has to be to get some bucks br br the filming is bad and i mean bad anyone with a camera would get the same result or better br br the acting lets just say don't go to the supermarket looking for actors the good ones usually come with a degree or at least have some damn experience the director mr jon keeyes please find your purpose in life as a director you simply suck your directing is poor the angles are all messed up not in a good way the lines seem as if they're being read out of toilet paper and the damn music it always comes up when it shouldn't and goes out for no apparent reason and don't go for writer either by the way making movies isn't like serving on a coffeshop it requires art and skill things i really doubt you'll ever have br br instead of making a badass shootout movie you should've shot this one back to oblivion and wait 'till something good came up or just go find a job on a coffeshop you'll have less stress and you'll save movie goers some money and a bad night br br vote 1 10 my first one
<START> i have just read the lead comment for this film that is on the front page with the voting results and cast run down br br why is it that some people can not take a film for what it is supposed to be br br this film is supposed to be a light hearted tonge in cheek family comedy things to make the kids laugh and things for the adults and that is exactly what this film does br br i laughed my nuts off at this film i thought carey put in a great performance and the whole film if watched at christmas really give you a bit of festive cheer br br so to all of you film reviewers stop trying to sound like film students and knock every film because it is not taxi driver or the godfather and take films for what they are supposed to be entertainment
<START> this movie purports to be a character study of perversion some reviewers have been gulled into assuming that because perversion is depicted the film is psychologically deep actually considering the salacious material it is surprisingly tedious and shallow with no motivational substance why is the main character the way she is you won't find out from the script for a better treatment of the same theme and a more entertaining movie try bunuel's belle de jour
<START> normally when i go on a raid of the local hollywood video i head towards the b horror movies to me the basic principals behind a b horror movie is it's camp value heavy gore lots of needless nudity and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex i rented cradle of fear strictly because i've been a fan of the band since they released they're first demo in 1995 the movie started off on an interesting note and then when i saw dani filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask i laughed when i saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene i laughed even harder i spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when i wasn't laughing i was shaking my head thinking about how a multi million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi hundreds of dollars the whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the hardcore goth kids who think death destruction sex blood and satan are the greatest things invented since lava lamps that was really it to me this movie seemed like 80 5 of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being satanic this movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this movie really is just an extended cradle of filth video
<START> how many fricken' times do we have to see a spook walking by in the background peaking through a mirror's reflection it's been done in two dozen movies in recent memory four dozen times in this choppy poorly done film there were only two freaky moments to appreciate when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters speaking of characters the acting was as flat as the diet coke in the 64 oz cup i was drawing it from the side characters could have been pulled from various scooby doo cartoons there was the friendly aged sheriff there was the kooky weirdo living in the backwoods with the alabama drawl lots'o'characters with no development the most disturbing image was that of a murdered child in the beginning but rather than explore the child's murder which would have been interesting they just let us know that she was dead her parents had a hard time reconciling her death with the community each other when they reach the cabin the scenes rarely flowed together with flashing images of the dead daughter interjected here there oh and the eerie sounds were also overdone you know what i mean creaking doors that open by themselves crickets in the forest yada yada yada ooooohhhh haven't seen that before again you'll see the amazing self opening door in the movie over and over an over again note to director a scary scene is only scary if it's not repeated every 5 minutes in the same film think these things out before calling out it's a wrap
