<START> soap opera about a small town married woman kay francis who works at the local newsstand performs as leading lady in her local playhouse but dreams of becoming a star on broadway when a famous actor who is a ham a windbag and a womanizer to boot arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom he pretends his valet is his manager tricking her into believing she has all it takes but experience to become a big star her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor's unexpected death which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected a life prison sentence for hubby next thing you know she's joined a traveling burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to broadway and making enough money to get her man's freedom all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk br br this film has a pretty interesting plot well a bit far fetched perhaps but very melodramatic with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it all greatly enhanced by the strong emotional performance given by kay francis she just makes this film also helping here is the well done acting by minna gombell in her role as a getting close to forty older lady who works the burlesque and befriends kay worth seeing especially for kay francis fans
<START> this was really a very bad movie i am a huge fan of italian horror argento mario bava fulci and yes even our good friend here lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one i found the first two 'demons' films to be highly entertaining they were so bad they were great but this one is just so bad that it is really really bad it is intensely boring the story never goes anywhere and i hated the characters the wife slapping husband and whiny cry baby pain in the wife drove me mad there was nowhere near enough of the story devoted to the ogre who was probably the best actor in the whole film i turned it off about three quarters of the way through because i was very very bored don't bother
<START> this film has it all the deft camera work reminiscent of martin scorcese or oliver stone the tight acting of 'heat' the explosive action of a jerry bruckheimer movie the witty dialogue of a tarantino script and the epic feel of say 'the godfather' br br the judge reinhold character displays a fiery temperememt yet also shows real emotional depth and intensity his performance reminds me of robert de niro's portrayal of jake la motta in raging bull br br the action scenes are truly breathtaking not since bullit has a movie depicted such high octane yet stylish car scenes the special effects push the boundries of technology and filmmaking to their limits independance day set the standard that this movie clearly has matched and greatly surpassed br br overall great acting from its a list cast like an oscars night party invitation list classy locations gripping action and a tight script
<START> cuba gooding jr is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the u s president i'll point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for and this film shows us why he teams up with a persistent news reporter angie harmon to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the president's death and so on blah blah blah br br even with a cast of james woods cuba gooding jr anne archer and angie harmon 'end game' fails to grab your attention plain and simple some of the action is good the acting isn't all bad and the story although clichÃ©d and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie well it doesn't the writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the characters br br 4 10 it's boring predictable and dull
<START> you can often tell a movie didn't turn out like it should by the heavy use of a narrator this film features this device throughout richard jobson not entirely content to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to gloss over what is a dull depressing tale which he must be mistaking for genuine art house kevin mckidd puts in a good performance everyone else is okay br br budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism br br the funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances a more extreme version of the problem mckidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes bless
<START> you've never seen anything like it once the coup begins it's the most dazzling edge of your seat thriller you'll ever see even though you know the outcome and it's all real because it's a documentary amazing br br by the time it was over it was on my top 10 list of all time great movies br br disregard the slobbering right wing fanatics everyone i know who has seen this film gives it the 4 star rating even if you don't care about politics or about venezuelan politics you will find yourself nerve racked and believe it on the edge of your seat br br it's a roller coaster ride
<START> i'm a huge jane austen fan and besides being a feature length film a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini series it was really great gwyneth paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well intentioned rich girl and jeremy northam is mr knightly with his poise and nobility i wasn't thrilled with ewan mcgregor even though i like him very much as an actor but didn't feel it spoiled the movie at all like i said as a jane austen fan there were things i would have liked to have seen included that weren't but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was i felt they really encapsulated the story well i've seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one
<START> as a matter of fact this is one of those movies you would have to give 7 5 to the fact is as already stated it's a great deal of fun wonderfully atmospheric askey does indeed come across as over the top but it's a great vehicle for him just as oh mr porter is for will hay if you like old dark house movies and trains then this is definitely for you br br strangely enough it's the kind of film that you'll want to see again and again it's friendly and charming in an endearing sort of way with all of the nostalgic references that made great wartime fare the 'odd' band of characters simply play off each other as they do in many another typical british wartime movie it would have been wonderful to have seen this film if it had been recorded by ealing studios a real pity that the 1931 original has not survived intact
<START> you probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie Â herbie fully loaded with crap and yes it is true this movie is really dreadful and totally lame br br this got to be the second worst movie lindsey is ever in since confession of the teenage drama queen the only good thing about this movie seem to be the over talent cast which by far is better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie i don't see how such a respected actor like matt dillon could be a part of this movie isn't he read that horrible screenplay before he sign on to be in it br br what i didn't like about this movie is also base on how herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a racer car after all it just a beatle i know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictable br br final words unless the kids are actually 5 12 years i highly doubt that any one could enjoy this senseless movie what wastage of my money i feel like cheated br br rating 3 10 grade f
<START> to be honost with you i think everything was so good in this movie there should be no reason why it didn't go into theaters the deaths in the movie are awesome the fx are awesome when used there are a few dull moments when the story's following the little girl but all in all this was a very good movie that i hope someday get's the props it should the very first part of the movie is prob why it came straight to video with them killing a little boy but after that the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the moms boyfriend who moved out to try to become a writer the property he buy's turns out to be where the witch tooth fairy lives and anyone who live in her house or goes on her property will be in great danger don't wanna give anything really away just a little info if you've wanted to see this movie then do so it's worth the price of the rental
<START> i find i enjoy this show but the format needs some work first off the good attributes i like how this show will take us through the day to day life of an addict because the producers have a knack at getting the addict to show us how bad they've allowed their lives to become this is followed by an intervention which is then followed by an outcome intervention doesn't candy coat things and sometimes the outcome often short term due to the constraints of time between filming and airing is a negative outcome this makes the positive outcomes all the better br br another thing i like about the show is the quality of the camera work given the reality that these cameramen have to squeeze anywhere and don't have the benefit of re shooting scenes the photography is surprisingly good and stable it's actually superior to scripted shows like the shield where the photography is so bad it can induce nausea br br now for the bad an episode will sometimes contain two completely different and unrelated cases that will be mixed together during the show you'll get caught up in the story of one addict then suddenly you're thrown into the story of another get caught up in that story then suddenly you're back to the first addict or are you by now you may have forgotten which case the individual currently on screen belong to this constant flip flopping between addicts really gets disruptive during the intervention scenes because the show will even mix together the two completely unrelated interventions i once heard the marketing b s reason for this poor design the show can get so intense that switching to another addict allows the viewer time to absorb what they're watching oh please clearly the reason this is done is because they have two cases that aren't big enough for an hour show so they mix two together by mixing them instead of giving each a half hour block like they should it forces the viewer to watch the entire thing and the commercials if they are interested in one case but not the other br br i used to find these blender episodes so annoying that i'd only tell my tivo to record episodes containing one addict but then it became easier just to record all of them
<START> absolute garbage worse fight scenes than a 20 year old van damme movie or american ninja etc br br truly dire acting not a skill in sight in the entire movie its like a cast of wooden sculptures br br watch it just for how truly bad this film is it may have been acceptable in the 80s but this is a 2006 movie i don't have much love for this movie as it wasn't born in the 80s br br if you like real fight movies then check out tony jaa in ong bak and the protector those are proper martial arts films br br have a laugh and watch this today you may see the unintenional humour at how grim it is
<START> i think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie doesn't live up to the trailer it's a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise and i think i'm seeing from the comments people having a love hate relationship with this movie br br however if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast i think it's still pretty good julia stiles is clearly the star she's so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with lee the rest of the cast of course lee's testosterone filled coworkers his elegant mother in law his fratlike friend jim and his bride to be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make stiles stand out in the first place br br lee doesn't live up to his costars i don't think but you could view that as more that they're hard to live up to maybe that's one source of disappointment br br the movie itself despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that don't come off as funny as the writer's intended is still pretty funny and i found a rather intelligent film the themes of conformity and taking the safe route seemed to cleverly align on several layers for example there was the whole motif of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms or just how everything selma blair and julia stiles' characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice br br the other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which jason lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck example the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef and some cleverness on his part gets away with it for the most part br br while it wasn't as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent but overall it's still a good movie
<START> is there anything that happens in this movie that is not predictable i think not basically the movie is clichÃ© after clichÃ© and really nothing ever comes as a surprise it makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension so for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as a drama it's a failure this is because the movie its story is highly unlikely i mean no way this could ever happen in real life as in the same way as the events occur in this movie so the movie has a real suspense and credibility problem br br but it truly are the clichÃ©s that killed the movie it was cringing stuff at times everything is so formulaic in this movie the predator is portrayed as a cool heartless almost psychopath like sexual frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman who acts like she didn't see any of this coming everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and all seemed to happen for a reason such as the sequence in which the 'predator' fixes the 'victims' broken car that has got to be one of the oldest clichÃ©s out of the book i knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point i tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing toward each other trough the eyes of the other persons around them it was so incredibly obvious and cheap that i almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point the movie is filled with moments like these br br the title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for tv movie which means that everything is slowly happening and the movie spends halve its time on character development and unnecessary sub plots to make the movie even more drama like br br i'll admit that elizabeth berkley is pretty good acting in this movie she makes some of the clichÃ©s and events look even almost realistic at times her hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the paul verhoeven movie showgirls so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies and television series like this one it's a waste of her talent and she surely deserves better all of the other characters are a disappointment corey sevier plays the clichÃ© pretty 'untouchable' rich boy and the way the husband of the main character is portrayed is even worse he looks more like a sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie he basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence he wakes up he wants sex before he goes to sleep he wants sex he gets home he wants sex it might be a realistic thing but i don't know it just didn't feel right for a movie like this one and the story in general br br a clichÃ© filled movie and i can't think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie it's predictable and therefor also lacks in suspense and credibility not an 'horrible' movie and it certainly is a watchable one at times but all the weak and clichÃ© elements in the movie also make this far from a recommendable one br br 4 10
<START> i am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself but i just got back from this movie and felt i had to express my opinions let me start by saying that i am a huge horror fan but what makes a horror movie i sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development i know they often lack in horror movies but prom night looked like it didn't even put forth any effort in that department next we all love suspense that on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises yeah prom night had none of that of course we like a terrifying killer prom night have that nope it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife and when all else fails at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore and the occasional nude scene yeah well when you have a horror movie rated pg 13 like prom night they leave that stuff out too so with all of these elements missing i ask does this still count as a horror movie nope i'd call it more of a comedy people in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when i saw semi pro that was supposed to actually be a comedy which also sucked but thats another story i think i am just going to have to give up on new horror all the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money the people i went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake which made me mad i wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake where will horror go next
<START> as someone who lives near buffalo new york this movie scored points with me before i even saw it since the story is based here there are even some bit parts with real life news tv anchor people from buffalo and for once it doesn't knock the area hallelujah br br theology wise puh leeze god is still made to look and think like humans and of course be a bit on the liberal side being the lightweight comedy it is it's nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes br br there are some laugh out loud slapstick comedy scenes and hopefully audiences from christians to atheists got something out of this besides a few laughs such as what prayer should really be all about kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message br br overall it's a good hearted film that should offend very few
<START> the only reason i am commenting is because i finally figured out why dr cox was bald although we probably all realized it at the same time this week dr cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them the latest episode when our favorite grumpy jesus loving nurse roberts dies dr cox shaves his head the must have showed them out of order for some odd reason and forgot they slipped up the continuity for shame scrubs they've made mistakes like this before i remember when elliot is trying to date scott foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits her i try not to notice these things but my favorite show needs to step it up
<START> after enjoying this show for years i use to dream of being able to see them all again and share them with my grandchildren i am so happy to pay a small amount for the memories that i have found recorded on dvd florida was a caring mother with a loving hard working husband one spoiled beautiful daughter and two sons as different as day and night michael the baby son is a freedom walker and jj is a clown i know many afro americans disliked this show but i know many can relate and should have accepted it as it was my heart was sad when i learned that ester rolle had passed tyler perry is now the leading writer actor of today and i support his work but not as much since he made such cruel mocking of rolle in one of his plays no one should have to hear ugly things about physical appearance the show started getting less interesting when daddy james died it picked up a bit when florida remarried but slumped when she took an absence from the show in all the show was great and again i am pleased to own copies of part of my past i do try to keep up with the work of the former stars of good times and i must say they are one group who has not been wiped up and down with rumors i think children of today will enjoy this show and i have no problem sitting and watching with children congrats to the writer crew and stars for years of renewed memories of a time that i can once again enjoy without having to skip scenes br br ok so i watch the shows over and over lately i have noticed thing that has made me rethink the series but not dislike them i think florida was a bit harsh when it came to money that the children made not that the children did not need supervision but it was done in a way that makes florida's mothering different the scenes where florida had to speak about how other people were not very good looking bothers me now when james was alive the show made a big thing out of james wanting his own fix it shop but never lived to see his family out of the projects but florida marries someone who owns a fix it shop a bit of a slap in the face to an actor who should have ended his time on good times showing that he accomplished all he strove for lastly as i watch the shows i see the series going in to overtime and being renamed jj to be truthful after james left everything mostly centered around jj not a bad thing just a noticeable thing i would not trade my dvd's for any amount of money but time maturity and experience began to guide your eyes after a while
<START> i can't believe we watched this total piece of crap but we did and i feel obligated to warn others to avoid it at all costs when one of the main characters announces that he's gay twice in the first five minutes don't ignore it as typical pc nonsense and figure it has to get better because it won't if his faggoty boyfriend hanging all over him doesn't make you sick then be thankful the freak who wrote and or directed this grossout is somehow attempting a little restraint i mean get real it's one thing for there to be a gay character appearing in a movie in such screwed up times as these but quite another to have it continually slapped on the screen and examined up close and personal when the the liner notes clearly state the flick's supposed to be about a mother seeking some sort of closure over the sudden death of her daughter what does one thing have to do with the other one might be tempted to ask apparently the two issues are inextricably interwoven and if that weren't bad enough there's the bearded lady at the ice cream parlor i mean seriously hasn't that poor woman ever heard of electrolysis why must she go around like that at the very least how about shaving the ugly thing off and while you're at it have those horrible moles removed too would you slurp up some ice cream she just served you i think not it must be a new jersey thing br br you'd think diane keaton might save this piece of drek but think again was she actually trying to put lipstick on a corpse i don't even wanna think about it so what if the body was supposed to be that of her own dead daughter this grotesque excuse for cinema is slop from the word go and that's all there is to it one wishes that each of these characters would simply walk out into the waves and just keep going none of these flaky people even remotely gain our sympathy for an instant trust me pass this piece of crap up it's not about death a mother who inadvertently suffocated her daughter or even the other much more unsavory issues it keeps bringing up no matter how little you want to hear it it's a load of perverted trash from a misguided and talentless director
<START> why the crap is this movie rated so low i've seen this movie over 25 times i know every line to this movie it's obvious that i love this movie trey parker and matt stone creators of south park and the new puppet masterpiece team america star as the main characters joe cooper or coop airman cooper and doug remer or sir swish mainly they're just referred to as coop and remer throughout the movie right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts they even go as far as to make one up called townsell i must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts and after playing for new england san diego huston saint louis a year for the toronto arganauts plus one season as a greater at the desert inn i'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of miami his agent leans over minnesota let us not forget this important piece of the movie so it starts that coop and remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates outside they create the sport baseketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes after shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year during this time they manage to recruit their third team mate squeak which is actually a day after they invent the game as the movie follows we find out that coop remer and squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left the story follows with zany blackmail the milwaukee beers cheerleaders and humor so absurd it'll leave you crying for more watch it dude it's hilarious
