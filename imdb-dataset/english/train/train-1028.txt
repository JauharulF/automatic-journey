<START> by no means my favourite austen novel and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress but i found the film almost totally delightful paltrow does a good job and cummings stevenson and the one who plays 'miss bates' are all absolutely terrific the period detail is not alienating the feel of the movie is just right in fact but the real 'find' is jeremy northam as mr knightley there could not be more perfect casting imo i hated mr k in the novel but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film northam's good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment either highly recommended anar
<START> i have been watching horror movies since i was 5 years old beginning with childs play since then i have seen good horror movies and bad but this is without question the dumbest movie i have ever seen the actors did all they could with the material the plot was just idiotic plus it was just all gore i can stomach a lot of blood but that was just ridiculous in one of the scenes a character gets stabbed in the rear end and choked with his intestines plain stupid another problem with this movie is that its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made the end of it is just dumb but then again it goes with the rest of it at the end when the girl gets away from the cannibal ancestor she receives help from a old lady the old lady is making tea but when she turns around to talk to the girl the girl attacks her she turned into a cannibal retarded movie
<START> i loved the original it was brilliant and always will be strangely though i actually looked forward to seeing the re make i'm usually a little bit against re makes because there's far too many of them but somehow this intrigued me i was really enjoying it to begin with caine brilliant as usual and jude law managing to hold is own next to him it was quite clever how it was modernised and it was working what stops this from being really good is the last seven minutes it goes completely away from the original so far in fact that is ceases to be clever and just gets annoying the end in the original was fantastic so much tension was built up and it was unbelievably clever this it grows not in tension but in frustration as it seemed they decided to make caine's character a homosexual it was if they were trying far to hard to be different and then bang law's dead roll credits this film is worth the watch simply for the performances but those last seven minutes really do drag it down what a pity
<START> rant start i didn't want to believe them at first but i guess this is what people are talking about when they say south korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill after the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie gwoemul aka the host of 2006 which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a b movie genre successive korean blockbusters have become more and more generic even though their budgets mainly spent on special effects have become more and more fantastic do south korean movie makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill which their industry has built up since the 1999 break out film shiri swiri by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland china did rant end br br the only reason i can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a korean east asian styled dragon i have seen to date for the final scenes now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 dragonheart the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons remember dungeons dragons in 2000 hasn't anyone learnt that the trick is not how much special effects you use but how well you use it i hope there are more and better korean legends they can use because they have just killed a lot of international interest in korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one br br in short i agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how koreans felt about having their folk anthem arirang being played at the very end as a creature feature i would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it but i've seen many video games with better camera work and scripting just less dragons
<START> when i found out there was a movie that had both my favorite actresses meryl streep and wynona ryder i went through the roof but i had a hard fall after watching this lame movie and i still have the bruise first of all the character that jeremy irons an actor i still admire even after this disappointment plays was just awful he treated his family like crap especially his sister played by glenn close i could not get close or sympathize with any of the characters and i'm no prude but the sex scenes were really unnecessary or they could have been toned down wynona and antonio's characters could have been developed a lot more and their romance could have been much more passionate and what was with meryl's character and her mystical powers why didn't they go into this more this film had a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that this is a really lousy movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here
<START> so on the chills network on cable they are having vampire month i'm such a dork but i love vampires so after a few duds that they showed i was pretty disappointed but then i noticed sleepwalkers was written by stephen king so i decided to go ahead and check it out well much to my surprise this movie was really bad most stephen king films are entertaining and some are very scary while sleepwalkers was bad it was a beautiful kind of bad i had a good time laughing at this movie and just taking it for what it was i've never read sleepwalkers from what i understand this is the only real vampire story by king so i can't really compare book to film i don't know if it was just my tv but sleepwalkers looked like it was made for tv the special effects were corny and the story was a bit far fetched even if it is fantasy it had a lot of problems br br charles brady and his mother mary are vampires who feed off the life force of virgin women they are considerably more resilient than humans and have powers of both telekinesis and illusion their one weakness is cats who are not only able to see through their illusions but whose claws are capable of inflicting severe to fatal wounds upon them they also maintain an incestuous relationship charles and mary have taken up residence in a small indiana town charles attends the local high school and there he meets tanya robertson in his creative writing class tanya does not suspect the real reason why charles wants her so much to take her life force for his mother who is starving at first it seems that charles has fallen in love with tanya on their first date however a picnic at the nearby cemetery charles attempts to drain the life force from tanya while kissing her as it happens deputy sheriff andy simpson who had earlier tried to pull charles over for speeding drives by the cemetery and notices charles' car when tanya runs to him for help charles tracks andy down and kills him when charles then turns to resume his life force depleting make out session with tanya the deputy's cat clovis rises to the occasion and nearly kills charles by scratching him in the face and chest mortally wounded by clovis charles staggers back home to mary mary then seeks vengeance on tanya's family br br so to sum this movie up basically you should expect the cheese to overflow the scene where charles attacks tanya for the first time is very clichÃ© and you almost vote for charles to win just because tanya is one of the dumbest female leads in horror movies then you gotta love the scene where mary has a gun and shoots it at a cop car and somehow the whole thing explodes god bless hollywood explosions and exaggerations i'm taking the movie for what it is it's just so deliciously bad that it turns into a dark comedy for me that i could just enjoy making fun of i'm not sure if this is what stephen king wanted to see for his story but he does have his typical cameo in the film so my suggestion if you watch this movie just take it for what it is and don't over think it it's mindless entertainment with corny effects bad casting a silly story and enough cats to make the crazy cat lady from the simpson's say wow that's a lot of cats br br 4 10
<START> i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies anyway everyone remembers the rms titanic it was big fast and unsinkable until april 1912 it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship well onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film br br so our two main characters are jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslet they're not annoying too much but watch this and you'll find out why they could become annoying http tinyurl com ojhoyn the main villain i guess is bad luck fate hand of god no blasphemy intended or just plain caledon hockley billy zane combine all of the above and what do you get oh yes we get a love story on a sinking boat the supporting characters are the following my personal favorite mr andrews victor garber idk he was so nice lovejoy david warner murdoch ewan stewart lightoller jonathan phillips captain smith bernard hill molly brown kathy bates and many more we also got the present day treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton they add something to the story something good the action in here is awesome especially in the second half the drama as also good in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears the story is simple and it works a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic two lovers separated by social class and ultimately the fate of the ship everything about the story works and there are very few flaws i give titanic an 86 awesome
<START> all of those who voted less than 5 are obviously not fans of clean tongue in cheek humor keaton is brilliant in this as in most of his work this is not a blockbuster bigger than life affair this is campy slapstick humor played out by some of hollywood's best and very versatile actors piscopo was equally on the mark as the top dog wannabee once br br if you want to see the funniest attempt at not really cussing ever filmed you gotta see dimitri do his piece as morone br br i gave it a 7
<START> pam grier stars as coffy she's a nurse who seeks revenge on the drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad heroine like any 70s blaxploitation flick you can expect to see the racist bad guys get their just desserts br br there were scores of these films made during the 70s and they were really demeaning to both black and white audiences alike this is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility in these films and the degrading stereotypical characters especially the female characters br br other common threads between coffy and other films of its type include brutal violence corrupt cops car chases a generous abundance of nudity and sex crazed gorgeous women not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug dealers pimps mobsters and other criminal scum br br pam grier was the undisputed queen of 70s blaxploitation heroines she was magnificent being both tough as nails and drop dead gorgeous like in her other films pam outshines the other characters in coffy in fact pam is so charismatic on screen that these sorts of films are unwatchable without her as the main character br br if you like pam grier you're better off seeing her other films like foxy brown or perhaps friday foster these films have much less empty sleaze than coffy does pam's character in coffy degrades herself way too much to get the bad guys pam's characters in her other blaxploitation films don't stoop as low to get revenge as coffy did br br i'd say only watch coffy if you're unable to see any of pam grier's other films otherwise coffy is a waste of time only pam's talent as an actress makes viewing coffy bearable
<START> watching this movie l thought to myself what a lot of garbage these girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be part of it waste of time watching it faint heavens l only hired it the acting was below standard and story was unbearable anyone contemplating watching this film please save your money the film has no credit at all l am a real film buff and this is worse than attack of the green tomatoes br br l only hope that this piece of trash didn't cost too much to make money would have been better spent on the homeless people of the world l only hope there isn't a sequel in the pipeline
<START> the only notable thing about this film is that it was steve mcqueen's first big starring role br br mcqueen's talent is undeveloped and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little sci fi horror piece steve shows himself as the anti establishment hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years hence br br later on mcqueen would say he hated this film and that he was the blob but everyone has to start somewhere and the blob is cute fresh and innocent would that we all had stayed that way br br the plot is fast paced and although predictable still an entertaining hour or so and it's really fun to see steve mcqueen before he became the king of kool and anita corsaut before she became andy taylor's girlfriend a close friend sent me the dvd a while back and it's a treasured addition to my steve mcqueen film collection
<START> spoilers br br in the words of jean paul sartre hell is other people in the odd couple jack lemmon and walter matthau demonstrate just how accurate this can be as felix ungar and oscar madison lemmon and matthau respectively create two good friends who decide to live together as the two begin to slowly grow more and more frustrated with each other the laughs come thick and fast before felix departs leaving oscar a changed and more cleanly individual br br jack lemmon as ungar is absolutely superb as the neurotic cleaning obsessed divorcee coping with life as a single man walter matthau in contrast to lemmon's character is equally as good as the slobbish sports writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for his child benefits br br lemmon and matthau are magnificant in their selected parts to some degree dependent upon the beautiful script by neil simon and simultaneously because they work well as a team as two friends who are inherently different in lifestyles although similar in relationships with ex wives and children these two late great actors create a partnership which is practically impossible to recreate so great in fact that the world screamed out so much for something similar that two years before matthau's death and three before lemmon's the characters were reunited in an inferior sequel this idea whilst following hollywood's irritating obsession with sequels might have worked to a certain degree but at the same time it could never come close to replicating the genius of this original film br br ultimately it's not really possible to say anything else with simon's amazing script filled with humour and laughter the creators of this film were already onto a hit the casting of jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix ungar and oscar madison though is the most important part of this film the odd couple with it's traditional soundtrack which even gained a tribute in the simpsons it's excellent script and it's genius leading men is a tribute to cinema and a feature for history to remember
<START> i like peter sellers most of the time i had never seen him portray an upper class brit until this movie he pulls it off pretty well although you see bits of inspector clouseau in the mix it doesn't get interesting until goldie hawn arrives br br i never expected the youthful hawn to deliver such a solid performance her timing was great and her expressions were priceless the way she alternately shoots sellers lecherous character down and seduces him is beautiful to watch verbal sparring like i've seldom seen from a movie of that era br br the last thirty minutes of the movie does fall flat it is worth the let down just to see the first sixty hawn is nude for a few glorious seconds early on enjoy it
<START> i consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling gentleman jim the best boxing movie ever made that is the robert wise paul newman flick somebody up there likes me that movie might be number 1 but gentleman jim is a close number 2 br br the movie doesn't just chronicle the rise of james j corbett it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition in the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare knuckle rules to the more gentlemanly days of the gloved marquis of queensbury rules and the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability br br gentleman jim is not a realistic look at those days it is romanticized and yes even a bit hokey at times but always delightfully so errol flynn is perfect as the gentleman jim who really isn't a gentleman at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family alexis smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love hate relationship and we all know it is of course love that will win that match in the end br br at the end of gentleman jim the great john l sullivan whose famous line was not i can lick any man in the world of course romanticism again hands over his belt to corbett this is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made realistic no but wonderful hey if you want realism watch raging bull instead that is a much more realistic boxing movie but gentleman jim is a lot more fun
<START> like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film i was also waxing nostalgic about it before i had the misfortune to actually watch it again alas my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy and the perils of pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal racist and plain boring film making even the presence of old pros edward everett horton and terry thomas can't overcome a rancid screenplay a horrible theme song and some wretched 'special effects' in addition the stereotypical depictions of african and arab characters make for painful viewing especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the civil rights movement michael weldon's original psychotronic encyclopedia reports that the perils of pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release judging from the results that is a completely believable and baffling scenario
<START> i was very impressed with this small independently made picture the story about a pair of social outcasts who meet become friends and provide each other with a support system both seemed to lack as children is at times hilarious at times sad but always provocative music mostly by underground bands was used to great effect as was the experimentation with camera angles filters and slow or fast motion techniques the performances the leads are played by the writers and directors of the film are some of the best i've seen in the last couple of years if you ever felt like a square peg being forced into a round slot i really believe you'll appreciate by hook or by crook
<START> this trashy b movie attempts to masquerade as a study of sexual addiction but it is really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick the story revolves around sammy horn subtle name played by michael des barres sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife grace rosanna arquette and a young child he has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting social security br br the story is centered on a conversation with his therapist nastassja kinski where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback this is nothing more than a convenient launching point for a parade of serial sex acts which consumes at least 75 of the screen time br br it is hard to know where to begin criticizing a film this bad the production values are abysmal the movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a tv soap opera at best and an amateur porn flick shot in someone's garage the direction by joseph brutsman is horrible with bad lighting uninspired framing and poor actor direction the script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgar br br women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed nymphomaniacs just waiting for an addict like sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal copulation as an example grace's sister comes over to indignantly inform sammy that she knows he's been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife his response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin raping her about three seconds into it she has an epiphany and is instantly converted to one of his sex disciples begging him to give her more just as they finish grace walks in and sis says to her oh great to see you gotta run to pick up timmy' and mum's the word about sammy's indiscretions the bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good ravishment no spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it br br the sex depictions are all overdone mechanical and so poorly simulated that they are more comical than erotic most of them are done with both participants fully clothed the acting is wretched michael des barres presents all the depth of a rain puddle he really seems to get into the thrusting and profanity of the sex parts but when it comes to actually acting with arquette and kinski he is adrift rosanna arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal nastassja kinski is far too compassionate as the therapist but at least we have some acting happening here the rest of the cast is just a collection of elevated body doubles to whom they give thought provoking lines like hit me harder is that the best you can do ' and oh godÂyes' br br this movie is among the worst i have ever seen a dubious distinction given the thousands of films i have viewed i have given it the extremely rare dishonor of rating it 1 10 not to be seen within three hours of any meal
<START> joseph h lewis was one of the finest directors of film noir this is surely his best br br it doesn't have some of the standard features of what we now call film noir though american made it is set entirely in england it lacks gangsters it lacks a femme fatale it does not lack crime br br the title character answers an ad she is overjoyed that she'll be making some money as a secretary instead she wakes up days later as the pawn in a frightening plot only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly unsettling ordeal and nina foch gives the sense of a strong woman as julia br br part of the excitement comes from casting against type ms foch has an elegant manner she is no screaming cowering victim she is actually a bit icy and patrician albeit impecunious this makes her character's plight all the more believable br br surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of dame may witty she was and is probably most famous for the charming title character in the lady vanishes she has a sweet manner and a harmless slightly dithering manner but here she is far from a heroine br br george macready is excellent as her extremely troubled son the whole cast in fact is superb br br it seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing but he did it on a low budget that is the thrill and charm of film noir the real film noir it is small convincingly lowlife and in this case unforgettable
<START> stoic and laconic soldier sergeant todd a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable kurt russell gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant colonel mekum deliciously played to the slimy hilt by jason isaacs who has todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise director paul w s anderson working from a smart and provocative script by david webb peoples depicts a chilling vision of a bleak cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough gritty tone throughout moreover anderson handles moving moments of humanity well todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant and stages the stirring action scenes with rip roaring gusto russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of todd he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions bang up supporting turns by jason scott lee as brutish rival soldier caine 607 connie nielson as the compassionate sandra sean pertwee as the kindly mace jared and taylor thorne as mute little boy nathan gary busey as crusty seasoned veteran captain church michael chiklis as the jolly johnny pig and brenda wehle as the sensible mayor hawkins better still this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might david tattersall's polished cinematography joel mcneely's rousing full bore orchestral score and the first rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction action hybrid outing
