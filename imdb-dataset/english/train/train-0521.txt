<START> ship ahoy was probably made in order to showcase mgm talent the film is a fun trip on an ocean liner on its way to san juan puerto rico at the time in which the country was involved in wwii this was typical fare for the studios which gave the movie going public light weight entertainment as a distraction during those difficult times the country was living br br the beautiful eleanor powell is seen at her best in some musical numbers where she clearly shows us she was a dancer to be reckoned with red skelton is also seen in a straight part with not too much clowning as he pursues the beautiful ms powell on the ship that is bringing them to puerto rico the irresistible bert lahr has good opportunities in the film to show he was a funny man also virginia grey is seen as a fun girl who is not fooled by anyone br br there are good musical numbers featuring tommy dorsey and his orchestra in which one sees among others the amazing buddy rich who has a few solos with mr dorsey and ms powell a young frank sinatra appears also as the lead singer of the band backed by the pied pipers br br this is a nostalgic trip that should be savored by fans of this genre which mgm totally controlled
<START> the only reason i didn't score this a one is that sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film it is a technically adept film br br that having been said this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program rather than actual fact and sibrel's irrefutable proof that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics br br i do not recommend watching this but if you do see it at google video for free don't let bart sibrel profit from your curiosity
<START> i am not so much like love sick as i image finally the film express sexual relationship of alex kik sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness frustration and jealous at last alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future ending up was sad br br the director tudor giurgiu was in amc theatre on sunday 12 00pm on 08 10 06 with us watched the movie together after the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of complicate br br on my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere i don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie the love proceeding of alex and kiki and kiki and her brother sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story br br the two main reasons i don't like this movie are firstly the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love sounds like after alex moved into the building which kiki was living then two girls are fall in love it doesn't make sense at all how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man too much fragments you need to image and connect those stories by your mind secondly the whole film didn't have a scene of alex and kik's sexual intercourse that 's what i was waiting forÂÂ however it still had some parts were deserved to recommend the ear piercing part was kind of interesting alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik's love that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love also the scene of they were lying in the soccer field the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate
<START> for daniel auteuil queen margot' was much better for nastassja kinski paris texas' was much better the biggest disappointments were from chris menges crisscross' and a world apart' cannot even be compared with this one and goran bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from queen margot' for this movie attention to the end of the film if this was an american pop movie i would not feel surprised at all but for a european film with more independent actors and director a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple minded and disappointing there are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people there are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone and finally there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys every character is shown in simple black and white terms the good versus the evil plus from the very beginning i could understand how the story would end is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse i believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie i think this movie was not disturbing but very disappointing
<START> my favorite imperialism movie and one of the best action adventure flicks of all time grant mclaglen and fairbanks dominate the screen with daring do and wise cracks to please all but the most pc of film goers memorable scenes abound the 3 sergeants and their 20 sepoys fighting off hundreds of thugs macchesney cutter giving bobby coote the spiked punch save some for the elephant cutter to macchesney i'm an expedition din breaking cutter out of jail with a fork what do you think i'm trying to break out of a bleedin' pudding and the incredible temple scene with cutter singing and then annoucing bold as brass all right you're all under arrest br br i could go on but suffice it to say i try to catch this film whenever it is on for armchair adventurers and generals it's hard to imagine a better 2 hours
<START> horrible horrible tv show why comedy central decided to repeat old episodes of this program is beyond me it really sucks i am of course speaking about the seasons after the first two the first two seasons were golden and if i was exclusively talking about those seasons this show would have gotten eight out of ten stars none of the comedians appearing after the first two seasons who were not part of the original cast are any good they were and are awful the comedy is not funny at all at all br br the original cast was full of very talented comedians like artie lange phil lamarr and mary schorr or whatever her name is all of whom should have gotten better deals after they left mad tv this show is highly overrated and less worthy of your channel surfing time than saturday night live another horrible show go out on saturday night and have fun and leave mad tv to wither and die as it deserves to
<START> while it certainly wasn't the best movie i've ever seen it was certainly worth the 8 which can't be said for many movies these days br br this was a pleasant account of a true story although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie ie billy sunday's character was three or four people in the real story combined together robert deniro was of course good and cuba gooding jr was also impressive
<START> the crimson rivers is one of the most over directed over the top over everything mess i've ever seen come out of france there's nothing worse than a french production trying to out do films made in hollywood and cr is a perfect example of such a wannabe horror action buddy flick i almost stopped it halfway through because i knew it wouldn't amount to anything but french guys trying to show off br br the film starts off promisingly like some sort of expansive horror film but it quickly shifts genres from horror to action to x files type to buddy flick that in the end cr is all of it and also none of it it's so full of clichÃ©s that at one point i thought the whole thing was a comedy the painful dialogue and those silent pauses with fades outs and fades ins just at the right expositionary moments made me groan i thought only films made in hollywood used this hackneyed technique br br the chase scene with vincent cassel running after the killer is so over directed and over done that it's almost a thing of beauty the climax on top of the mountain with the stupid revelation about the killer s with cassel and reno playing buddies like nolte and murphy in 48 hrs completely derailed what little credibility the film had by then br br it's difficult to believe that the director of the crimson rivers also directed gothika which though had its share of problems doesn't even come close to the awfulness of this overbaked confused film
<START> gday mates just watched croc hunter the movie it was alright but the show seems more real this just seemed like a longer animalplanet episode with funnier lines and more characters a few things steve described snakes fangs like hypodermic needles yeeeowch for reals you know that hurts and cant they jump up high hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff there was two major cleavage shots in this movie when terry find that baby joey she goes like we have to nurture them just like a baby woah i thought she was gonna up breast feed that kid that woulda made it pg 13 though while on terry did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show terry's knowledge on ritual mating she knows her sex stuffs movie takes place in queensland austrailia i want a koala dingo and joey br br steve's dog sui actually has a purpose in this movie albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite wielding hottie br br oh and if anyone else watches this try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was right in shotgunning the croc he was eating her sheep i would be mad too
<START> director sam fuller has something of a cult following particularly in europe yet the bulk of his films are more than forgettable he did however direct one really terrific movie in pickup on south street made pretty early on in his career the movies that followed were vastly inferior br br from the first to the last frame pickup works on all levels it's filmed with flawless fluidity boasting fine performances all round richard widmark and thelma ritter both players with a fine record of top notch performances are at their peak widmark who was no stranger at playing villains while truly mean to the core still manages to reveal just the slightest humanity which makes his character fascinating as well as making jean peters character's falling for him all the more credible br br fuller holds no punches in this genuinely tough movie there is a scene in which jean peters get roughed up by widmark it's truly shocking in its reality this is not a case of carefully choreographed photography br br less self conscious than many film noir's of the period this remains a great example of the genre
<START> this police procedural is no worse than many others of its era and better than quite a few obviously it is following in the steps of dragnet and naked city but emerges as an enjoyable programmer the best thing about it is the unadorned look it provides into a world now long gone the lower class new york of the late 40's early 50's here it is in all its seedy glory from the old school tattoo parlors to the cheap hotels to the greasy spoons these old police films are like travelogues to a bygone era and very bittersweet to anybody who dislikes the sanitized soulless cityscape of today br br also intriguing is the emphasis on the nuts and bolts scientific aspect of solving the crime in this case the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car our main heroes detectives tobin and corrigan do the footwork but without the tedious and painstaking efforts of the lab boys they'd get nowhere although the technology is not in the same league the cops here use the dogged persistence of a c s i investigator to track down their man br br the way some reviewers have written about this movie you think it would have been directed by ed wood and acted by extras from his movies what bosh i enjoyed john miles as the gangly ex marine turned cop tobin he had a happy go lucky easy going approach to the role that's a welcome change from the usual stone faced histrionics of most movie cops of the period patricia barry is cute and delightful as his perky girlfriend who helps solve the crime walter kinsella is stuffy and droll as the older detective corrigan i rather liked the chemistry of these two and it made for something a bit different than the sort of robotic dragnet approach br br the mystery itself is not too deep and the final chase and shoot out certainly won't rank amongst the classics of crime cinema but during it's brief running time the tattooed stranger more than held my interest
<START> an old saying goes if you think you have problems visit a hospital that has been updated in recent years to if you think you have problems watch a tv talk show especially jerry springer's this movie is one of those that is so bad it's good that's why i gave it a seven it's all right but not great it's a great way to waste 95 minutes just as the daily talk show is advertised as an hour of your life you'll never get back all the familiar themes are here unfaithful husbands boyfriends the wildest audience on television women flashing jerry etc the shocker was watching molly hagan who normally plays sweet characters seinfeld and herman's head playing a trailer trash mom and jaime pressly my name is earl as her equally trashy daughter performing sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they came in contact the men including the staff producer were presented as quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got i don't want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show here in phoenix it's shown back to back for two hours every morning and after that everything else seems to pale again i give this movie a seven it's good but not great jerry springer is best taken in small one hour doses
<START> i don't know why but i thought i've seen this movie before maybe it was the name maybe it was the way poster looked i don't know anyway it was quite promising in the beginning and even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments maybe its because i'm not a huge fan of the horrors and i don't watch them a lot but this one actually looked fresh sometimes but the rest of it is not so good laughable at times the movie is slow paced sometimes you will get so bored you'd forget what was the story about characters are not great either all of them the butcher is ok seems creepy and crazy enough although i didn't get what were those weird looking things on his chest that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out of the blue and why he was collecting those in jars at home the main lead is plain his character is really hard to believe in and very undeveloped but i guess thats scenarists fault like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend side cast is bad too but the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl my god when will women in horror movies have any brains its ridiculous the girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera tries going to police that fails and then she thinks of the best idea ever why don't we just go and take it i know where the maniac lives yup thats swell and then look for the camera in the bathroom why not and then walk in the room see a bag that was not there before and just have a look inside maybe camera is there not there but loads of interesting stuff shiny mmmm to realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain then of course the never ending falling while running away trick that really made it look bad then to put the final nail into the character in the end of the movie she walks into the wagon full with dead bodies hanging feet up screams noooo like she just ripped her gucci bag and walks further into the wagon jeez come on no one else thinks its just well stupid just awful if her character wasn't so bad maybe the movie would get another star or two from me and i would even forgive mmt characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer that dude in the train who the conductor killed butcher vests that can protect from bullets weird and cheap looking monsters in the end i didn't read clive barkers novel so i have no idea where those monsters came from the fact that no one cared that hundreds judging on the skeletons in the dungeon disappeared in the city and main character that didn't bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out he barely noticed it i guess oh and the predictable ending damn i knew the ending half way in its just disappointing the only reason i'm still giving some credit to the makers is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i've watched past few months visual style is nice some shots were really nice and good cgi that made the killings look really brutal although blood didn't look real at all i guess some people will enjoy it some like me will watch it if there is nothing else to watch some will absolutely hate it
<START> one of the more sensible comedies to hit the hindi film screens a remake of priyadarshans 80s malayalam hit boeing boeing which in turn was a remake of the 60s hollywoon hit of the same name garam masala elevates the standard of comedies in hindi cinema br br akshay kumar has once again proved his is one of the best super stars of hindi cinema who can do comedy he has combined well with the new hunk john abraham however john still remains in akshays shadows and fails to rise to the occasion br br the new gals are cute and do complete justice to their roles br br a must watch comedy leave your brains away and laugh for 2 hrs after all laughter is the best medicine ask priyadarshan and akshay kumar
<START> i first saw this film as a teenager it was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world trick or treat has every element for a movie that rocks with a cast that features skippy from family ties gene simmons of kiss and ozzy osbourne as a preacher how can you go wrong backwards evil messages played on vinyl yes thats right they use records in this movie in one scene eddie skippy is listening to a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things begin to get scary monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed as a teenager i tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine almost 20 years later trick or treat is still one of my all time favorite movies
<START> hi for all the people who have seen this wonderful movie im sure thet you would have liked it as much as i i love the songs once you have seen the show you can sing along as though you are part of the show singing and dancing dancing and singing the song one is an all time fave musical song too and the strutters at the end with the mirror its so oh you have to watch this one
<START> the haunted world of edward d wood jr isn't a particularly good documentary aesthetically it's lackluster and cheap looking the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in cohesive but this adds to it's charm i say this because it's a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and as such there's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary overall it's worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general but don't expect brilliance here expect a documentary made after wood's own heart
<START> my left foot is an epic outstanding film explaining the life and times of christy brown who had cerebral palsy a severe disability and had only the use of his left foot but he was defiant he managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds br br i have seen this film a lot of times and each time i see it i find it equally brilliant each time i wonder how did this amazing film not win an oscer for best picture it is a shambles by the academy awards jim shirdan is to me one of the greatest directors in the world the screenplay the music and anything else is excellent in this film as the film goes on you would nearly feel your in the brown household as everything occurs ray macanally and brenda fricker are amazing as cristies parents and fiona shaw is equally brilliant as d r eileen cole who helps christy on his battle of defiance br br the irish film industry had noting much to its name before my left foot my left foot was the start of a wonderful period in irish film films so powerful and brilliant such as the field the crying game in the name of the father and michael collins followed my left foot these irish films were regarded so highly around the world and were nominated for multiple oscers and won some a wonderful period for irish film my left foot is a powerful outstanding film br br daniel day lewis plays the crippled christy brown so well and so brilliantly and the same goes for hugh o conner who plays young christy to me those two performances are two of the best ever film performances especially daniel day lewis's performance which i would regard as high as antony hopkins in the silence of the lambs daniel day lewis has proved in his career that he is an great actor br br this is an excellent masterpiece in film see it
<START> it was nice to see all the familiar characters again but the story bothered me we loved ariel in the first movie so why is the second one centered around her daughter the new characters were annoying and i didn't like the plot of this worst of all christopher daniel barnes didn't come back as the voice of eric disney please stop remaking classic movies with these shoddy imitations
<START> during the opening night of the vanties a woman is found dead on the catwalk above the stage as the show continues the police attempt to piece together who killed who and why before the final curtain br br i had always heard that this was a great classic comedy mystery so i was excited to find myself a copy unfortunately no one told me about the musical numbers which go on and on and on while the numbers certainly are the type that hollywood did in their glory days they become intrusive because they pretty much stop the movie dead despite attempts to weave action around them this wouldn't be so bad if the music was half way decent but its not there is only one good song worse its as if the studio knew they had one song cocktails for two and we're forced to endure four versions of it a duet a big production number as the vanities finale and in the background as incidental music i don't think spike jones and his city slickers ever played it that much the rest of the movie is pretty good with victor mclaglen sparring nicely with jack oakie charles middleton is very funny is his scenes as an actor in love with the wardrobe mistress br br by no mean essential i can recommend this if you think you can get through the musical numbers or are willing to scan through them its a fun movie of the sort they don't make any more
