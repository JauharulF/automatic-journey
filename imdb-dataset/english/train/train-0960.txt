<START> the plot of goodnight mr tom on paper makes it seem we are in for a large dose of maudlin sickly sentiment but talented director jack gold is an expert on touching the emotions in the right manner and it emerges instead as a compelling deeply moving wartime drama with excellent production and lead performances one of the best if not the best tv movies of the 1990's which possibly would've had even greater success if it had been released in the cinemas br br the evacuation of children to countryside towns and villages in world war ii was of course a common practice but in the case of the young boy here was doubly important because of a wretched home life in the uk's capital the horrors of war on the home front are not drifted over though and the construction of the film until it's throat lumping misty eyed ending leaves us with a sense of optimism despite what has happened before it is almost but not quite worthy of comparison with the finale to it's a wonderful life 1946 all in all a modern classic
<START> to like this movie at most you must be a strongly in love without a marriage b acknowledge english humor which is about admiring gallant and witty life situations and not just running gags c be fairly very intelligent because authors gave an opportunity to laugh and cry over every single minute of this movie and only if you meet b and c requirements you can recognize and enjoy author's input d to fully enjoy the movie you must love women like kirsted dunst who is so natural sweet and irresistible e you must admire creative a little melancholic people with great and remarkable personalities br br if you meet all these requirements you'll be likely to rate this movie near 10 points br br i never laughed half as much as from watching this masterpiece and i even managed to cry while laughing in some moments i always get sensitive whenever good things happen to kirsten dunst
<START> i rented this because i'm a bit weary of '80s nbc programming and apparently i saved myself a lot of money i have nothing against any of the actors and for their credit they do a good job but this show is flawed from the premise br br we have a character who is unlikable he's full of flaws not enlightened and a complete jerk on a good day yet the reason why anybody should care just isn't there while creating an american sitcom centered around a complete bullheaded jackass is revolutionary and full of potential it just isn't met here within this show most of the supporting characters aren't fully fleshed characters but rather sad punching bags that want empathy from the audience for being punching bags as in any sitcom they are the ones who are made the most normal for the audience to relate to and in doing this they negate the lead character to such an extent that we see bittinger being himself and harming people and they just stay there because why there is no reason any normal people would have simply left the abuse keeping them there without any real reason even the really unbelievable one given by joanna cassidy in the very special 2 part abortion episode that has major problems of its own is where the show just falls apart to simply believe that people put up with this guy because we are told he has a heart of gold does not mesh with the reality of the situation if anything this isn't even dramedy this is a badly plotted conceived and executed premise that had a few moments but overall met the fate it deserved someone had the guts to go out and make a very good idea but the execution is so haphazard that it just looks like a weirdly scripted version of the jerry springer show where someone is abused by this tyrant that we're supposed to root for because we are told to a show like this requires a deft touch that the actors here could have provided easily but somehow aren't able to and that's a fatal error that really killed the program br br chalk it up to a show in its infancy regardless the show is worth a watch but it really screwed up when trying to aim for the stars and made the whole enterprise not what it could have been
<START> i was supposed to review this for a website and i watched this with optimism that perhaps it would at least be a cheesy yet entertaining rip off and it didn't even do that well enough br br 666 the child is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers i've ever seen even worse than godsend with scenes that rip from the omen without shame the ending is even very similar to the way the omen ends br br not to mention that the acting writing and story are all just hackneyed if these movies make money i'm sad to see where asylum is headed it's embarrassing
<START> i have previously seen zu warriors from the magic mountain in that film the setting takes place in china's mountains the legend of zu looks like another dimension thank that to tsui hark's extensive use of cgi effects he's able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds a land where beings fly freely and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades split swords and the ultra cool moon orb br br while there are many characters in this one the focus is mainly on king sky and enigma the romance aspect is there although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor cecilia cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching in the beginning i like how she resembles the countess from zu warriors and she does well playing enigma as she deals with facing her past life oh by the way did i mention that cecilia's very appealing to the eye br br in truth zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 tsui hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema
<START> an absolute steaming pile of cow dung it's mind blowing to me that this film was even made hip hop and old westerns just don't seem to mix what target audience were these people thinking of when planning this trainwreck br br not only is the concept and plot a joke but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare of a film makes their entire careers a laughing stock the chick from clueless should never be forgiven and she is stripped of any remaining dignity she had after reading the first ten pages of dialogue she should have been asking which one of her friends was playing this sick joke after some research i actually found a list of some other actors who passed on this film jada pinkett smith denzel washington brandy monique kim kardasian jenna jameson oprah and finally marge simpson br br simply put i would rather stare at a blank tv than watch this movie again
<START> i really really enjoyed watching this movie at first seeing its poster i thought it was just another easy romantic comedy but it is simply more than this i personally believe that this idea that i'm sure a good part of the viewers had just before they saw the movie it's yet another important part of the big concept of this movie itself or even of its marketing strategy what i mean is nowadays we are slaves to images to impressions i went to the cinema to view this film having the wrong impression the wrong expectations and at the end i felt how superficial i could be to exemplify it comes to my mind the sequence near the end in which sidney buys the plane ticket to go back to new york and as he is asked to 'give an autograph' meaning to sign for the ticket he believes that just because he got on tv thanks to the scandal at the awards he is now some kind of celebrity and this is just i believe the climax of this main theme around which the movies revolves above this i believe the movie also offers us a solution to get along with this illustrated throughout the movie by sidney's attitude don't become too serious about yourself or about anybody else even saints were people in the beginning as sophie once says in the movie the saints of the moment are the stars we attribute them an 'aura' of perfection of eternal happiness but the reality is much less than that even the saints of any religion are images ideal models of how to behave and how to live your life even they were not for real they became 'for real' after they died and we looked back at them and that's the catch we need our saints we need our stars we strive for them as if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have anything to strive for and television and all other media are means to create and capture our strivings we desperately need benchmarks in regard to which to measure ourselves and that's how we got in the cinema to watch this movie in the first place to see if we can fit the benchmark or if the benchmark is to small for us this time it was larger than we expected
<START> i'm going to keep this review short and sweet br br i saw the trailer for this and thought i'd give it a whirl 5 minutes in and my initial thoughts were what the hell is this but after 10 minutes i was hooked and after 20 i was picking my jaw up from off the floor this film is a great example of how different a movie can be and furthermore it's french this film is high art eye candy wrapped up in a tidy futuristic film noir package the motion capture is very clever and the black and white animation style which has no grey although at first didn't do it for me totally captivated me and by the end of the film and i found myself wishing every film was made like this i think my opinion was helped by the great dubbing it would have been very easy to ruin it had they not landed so many respected actors as many voice actors give no feeling to the characters just watch any hong kong legends film in english to see a perfect example i gave it 9 although i gave it an extra 2 because of how fresh and new the whole thing feels
<START> as i was watching this film on video last night i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure i've a feeling i'll be watching this again and again for years to come br br it's got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story film and even though some cultural references are obscure for me a western viewer at the core this is a universal tale
<START> from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb this movie seems to get ragged on a lot but i didn't think it was that bad i've seen much worse actually br br the house where evil dwells is a ghost story about a husband and his wife ted and laura fletcher and their daughter amy who move into an old house in japan little do they know a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword as strange things happen in the house the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living and plan on re enacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years back br br i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story it was routine and it was corny but i've seen worse in my day the ghost sequences were a little over done we get to see the translucent blue tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family and take over their bodies to be honest the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disneyland i may be mistaken but after watching this it seemed to me that the japanese horror film ju on the grudge and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place ghostly activity curses put on the home etc but i may be wrong br br to sum it up this is a pretty corny ghost story don't go out of your way to see it but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot 4 10
<START> the film attempts to be a mockumentary shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts but fails in not providing the audience with any characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary also the film purports to be about finding real love in los angeles but is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first big movie
<START> dolph lundgren stars as murray wilson an alcoholic ex cop who gets involved with a serial killer who kills during sex after his brother is murdered wilson starts his own investigation and finds out a lot of his brother's secrets in this very dull thriller lundgren mails in his performance and the movie is flat and lethargic also when has anyone watched a dolph lundgren movie for anything but action
<START> watching film i was in very light mood and also this film is light but the end of the film is just unexpected which leaves a long lasting memories in one's mind br br movie starts with abhay and his profession of being witness during registrar marriage soha comes for marriage and his boyfriend doesn't leaving soha alone on to the street she cant go back home and she don't have any thing to live on here in this situation abahy turns out to be a helper for her this is the base of story br br the rest is just watchable and the end of the story is bitter sweet that abhay has to face which keeps you at the edge of the seat br br dialogues and music are good songs are ok direction is good and so as the screenplay you do feel that movie is slow but looking to the demand of story it is all right br br a truly watchable especially with light mood i enjoyed this at home with coke and peanuts my rating for this is 8 10
<START> this little seen movie is a languid and laid back giallo it veers away from some of the clichÃ©'s of the genre and adopts a looser approach it's about a woman searching for her missing lover a psychiatrist who has suddenly vanished for no apparent reason her search leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals in true giallo style murder is never far away br br the cast is really rather good we have aldofo celi thunderball alida valli suspiria horst frank cat o' nine tails and a very young sybil danning 80's scream queen the lead actress is rosemary dexter and while i am not familiar with her she does a good job in leading the picture br br one of the defining features of eye in the labyrinth is its music atypically for a giallo it features a jazz rock fusion soundtrack this score composed by roberto nicolosi is reminiscent of miles davis especially his work on in a silent way it's an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel than most gialli the fusion groove accentuates the languid atmosphere and compliments the sunny sea front scenery that the film is mostly made up of br br this is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder set pieces well this film falls a little short in this regard it's certainly not devoid of them but they are few and far between the opening dream murder being probably the best on offer as well as a memorable burning car sequence but this really isn't a particularly violent film still i don't think it should disappoint too many seasoned fans of the genre the mystery is fairly compelling and it has enough eccentric characters the idiot boy saro and that unsettlingly inappropriate dubbed accent and moments of the bizarre to satisfy while the sleaze factor is upheld with a smattering of nudity throughout br br eye in the labyrinth plays like a giallo version of an agatha christie mystery as it features a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa all under suspicion of murder we have the obligatory flashbacks detailing their connections with the final hours of the highly unsympathetic murder victim while this isn't a grade a example of the genre it's certainly an appealingly different one as it doesn't borrow too heavily from other films of the sub genre for giallo enthusiasts i give this a thumbs up and hope one day it's given a nice dvd transfer it certainly deserves the treatment
<START> this movie has everything you want from an action movie explosions shootouts bad guys and worse guys it is fun to see james belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he has gotten himself in to since he stole 12 million dollars from the ultimate big boss the skipper does this sounds cheesy of course it is but boy did i have fun watching this movie it is a whole lot better than all the direct to dvd garbage that is made nowadays if you can get over the silly plot than you will find out that this movie has quite a few surprises in store you could argue about the twists being predictable but the fast pace of this movie doesn't give you time too think too much of them which is a blessing since this movie is not about revealing the ultimate twist but more about the journey to that moment only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie they probably expected a movie about mobsters in stead of some crooks double crossing each other pure fun
<START> meet peter houseman rock star genetic professor at virgina university when he's not ballin' on the court he's blowing minds and dropping panties in his classroom lectures dr houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells allowing humans to become immortal i'd want to be immortal too if i looked like christian bale and got the sweet female lovin that only vu can offer an assortment of old and ugly university professors don't care for the popular houseman and cut off funding for his project due to lack of results this causes peter to use himself as the guinea pig for his serum much to my amazement there are side effects and he get this metamorphoses into something that is embedded into our genetic dna that has been repressed for millions of years he also beds dr mike's crush sally after a whole day of knowing her she has a son his name is tommy he is an angry little boy br br metamorphosis isn't a terrible movie just not a well produced one the whole time i watched this i couldn't get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989 the look and feel of the movie is late seventies quality at the latest it does not help that it's packaged along with 1970's movies as metamorphosis is part of mill creek entertainment's 50 chilling classics there is basically no film quality difference whatsoever the final five minutes are pure bad movie cheese that actually for me at least save the movie from a lower rating pay attention to the computer terminology such as cromosonic anomaly no wonder peter's experiment failed your computer can't spell this is worthy of a view followed by a trip to your local tavern
<START> the incredible melting man is a fantastically gross trashy and energetic z grade production that every self respecting camp horror freak simply has to see for him herself the ideal way to describe this low budget 70's gem is like a shameless copy of hammer's the quatermass xperiment only a thousand times filthier astronaust steve west is the only survivor of a disastrous space mission but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and causes him to melt in shock after seeing his face in the mirror can you blame him steve busts out of the hospital leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind doctor ted nelson has to find him urgently as the disease also set steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh the premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make up effects from the hand of rick baker the melting dude's face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like darth vader another big advantage is that william sachs' screenplay doesn't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches the repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script you'll miss out on all the campy fun
<START> one of the weaker carry on adventures sees sid james as the head of a crime gang stealing contraceptive pills the fourth of the series to be hospital based it's possibly the least of the genre there's a curiously flat feel throughout with all seemingly squandered on below par material this is far from the late 70s nadir but williams james bresslaw maynard et al are all class performers yet not given the backing of a script equal to their ability br br most of the gags are onrunning rather than episodic as carry ons usually are so that instead of the traditional hit and miss ratio if you don't find the joke funny in the first place you're stuck with it for most of the film these continuous plot strands include williams Â for no good reason Â worrying that he's changing sex and kenneth cope in drag like the stagy physical pratt falls the whole thing feels more contrived than in other movies and lacking in cast interest continuing this theme matron lacks the customary pun and innuendo format largely opting for characterisation and consequence to provide the humour in fact the somewhat puerile series of laboured misunderstandings and forced circumstance reminds one more of terry and june so it's appropriate that terry scott is present mugging futilely throughout br br some dialogue exchanges have a bit of the old magic such as this between scott and cope what about a little drink oh no no i never touch it oh cigarette then no i never touch them that leaves only one thing to offer you i never touch that either that said while a funny man in his own right livening up the duller episodes of randall and hopkirk deceased no end you do feel that cope isn't quite tapped in to the self parodying carry on idealology and that bernard bresslaw dressed as a nurse would be far funnier this does actually happen in part though only for the last fifteen minutes br br williams attempting to seduce hattie jacques while charles hawtrey is hiding in a cupboard is pure drawer room farce but lacks the irony to carry it off that said williams's description of premarital relations is priceless you don't just go into the shop and buy enough for the whole room you tear yourself off a little strip and try it first that may be so counters jacques but you're not going to stick me up against a wall williams really comes to life in his scenes with hattie and you can never get bored of hearing a tin whistle whenever someone accidentally flashes their knickers br br carry on matron is not a bad film by any means just a crushingly bog standard one
<START> what a movie i never imagined richard attenborough could have such a movie in him gandhi has always left me indifferent apart from ben kingsley's performance and i never considered attenborough a particularly good filmmaker but cry freedom held my interest like few movies have in recent times it's an exciting mesmerizing political movie with great performances by kevin kline and a young denzel washington br br kline plays donald woods a south africa newspaper editor who befriends the civil rights activist steve biko it starts as a difficult friendship for woods sees biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites but biko with his kind words upbeat attitude and complete transparency wins over woods and introduces him to a reality about apartheid that woods knew nothing about br br biko is a decent law abiding citizen who altruistically stands up against all prejudice and the system that keeps down his people one night coming from an illegal meeting he's arrested and beaten to death the authorities try to hush up the matter because biko has become a huge personality in south africa but through the efforts of woods the truth comes out but what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare as woods and his family become targets for the secret police br br this movie has an interesting structure it has in fact two narratives first it narrates the life and death of biko it's an amazing first half completely dominated by the charisma of washington in what may be his greatest performance yet br br the second half no less interesting narrates woods attempt to escape from south africa to publish a book about biko woods has become an enemy of state a banned person which means he can't meet people or leave his country plus he's constantly spied by the police kevin kline gives a great performance in this second half too br br although the first half is quite straightforward the second does interesting things with editing by giving flashbacks of biko and of events that show the repression against the black south africans some may argue this is to make it more interesting but for me the second half just as captivating as woods and his family devise a bold plan to escape south africa br br the last minutes were so heartbreaking i was in tears george fenton and jonas gwangwa's score certainly had something to do with it although i've never been much of a fan of fenton cannot stand his gandhi score i do think the score for cry freedom is one of the most beautiful ever composed for cinema the movie thanks to the music married to the powerful images at times reached incredible peaks of emotion br br cry freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch because of denzel washington this is a movie to be cherished in its entirety acting writing music editing cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit this movie deserve a place alongside movies like the pianist life is beautiful and the shawshank redemption
