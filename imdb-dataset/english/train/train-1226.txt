<START> great western i hear you all say brilliant first effort well i'm not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one i saw great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none the acting was poor to say the least and i couldn't care less about any of the characters making the whole film pointless the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to tv low budget rubbish like you see on those fact or fiction programmes on sci fi br br please if you are looking for a good film a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half please look elsewhere
<START> govind nihalani's directorial venture of vijay tendulkar's novel is brilliant om puri plays an inspector velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar this is govind nihlan's most talked about movie this is a very good and a classic film smita patil plays the female lead opposite om puri naseeruddin shah is brilliant in a cameo role although sadashiv amrapurkar has only 4 scenes in the movie he dominates the movie this was sadashiv amrapurkars acting debut om puri won a national award for this film for the best actor filmfare award winner for best film story supporting actor sadashiv amrapurkar
<START> before seeing this i was put off by the subject matter but this is not your average triumph over adversity story although this is technically about blind tibetan kids climbing mt everest there is so much more to it this movie shows the very strong often contradictory personalities of two highly accomplished blind adults leading the children erik and sabriye erik is an american blind mountain climber athlete and sabriye is a blind german academic who started a school in lhasa tibet they are both exceptional in their own ways but disagree on what will really build confidence in the kids erik wants them to reach the summit while sabriye wants them to enjoy erik as a role model and take pleasure in moment the nuances are complicated and one walks away not really being sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea the most profound scenes are with the tibetan children themselves and the hardships they faced before finding their way to the school the most moving for me was the story of tashi a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him i could watch a whole movie on his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school he is now running a successful small business with some of his fellow students if you liked spellbound or murderball you will love this
<START> i was really horrified by this eerie movie what an unusual dark atmosphere and such a creepy musical score really promising indeed after ten minutes you really start sweating and feeling uncomfortable for you start fearing the worst this movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare and what's worse it all comes out for one hour and a half i have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake nuit noire is a truly horrifying picture for your eyes your ears your intelligence and most of all your wallet since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo is the biggest horror of all
<START> i was lured to see this movie by its starpower but ultimately that's all it delivers it plays much more like a greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption it's greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense we know who the bad guys are from the beginning and just follow along as they fall like dominoes the film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex but has forgotten to substitute good clean romance or excitement in any other way all the flavor of a good flat decaffeinated diet cola q a which also takes place in new york is a far better alternative as is la confidential
<START> i expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring hip hop but was disappointed on many levels first of all the story is so badly recycled as to make it almost unbearable second the setting acting and story are not very authentic or believable third there are a lot more good black actors to choose from than these standard picks how about some originality third there were very few hip hop songs played in entirity if any none seemd really central overall film was a great disappointment but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the film worthwhile
<START> the mother is one of those films that you know is good maybe even great but it is like eating vegetables or doing math homework is to a kid too much work and a whole lot of pain to get invested in br br the story is potentially distasteful in many ways the death of a character within the first half hour the december may romance the idea of a man cheating on his wife and then cheating on his lover with her mother the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty something characters the apparent indifference of the adults to the children in their lives this movie was made in the 2002 or 2003 but is a throw back to a collection of british usually made for tv movies from the late 1980's it has a moral severity that never lets up which produces an enveloping throbbing angst br br the mother is flawless but that is in part the problem if a film dealing with so many sensitive issues has some flaws inconsistencies of script some lesser actors it takes the edge off but if such a film is so pitch perfect the experience of watching it is raw and painful even the technical qualities lighting editing etc make the viewer ache the london in this movie is bright and open filled with harsh cutting light br br if you are tough as nails or are one of those super sensitive people who likes to torture themselves with gut wrenching sad movies or novels then you will enjoy the mother anyone in between give it a miss or be prepared to squirm and be warned as tough as the movie is from beginning to near end the worst is to come br br toward the end of the movie the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it for having slept with her boyfriend and the daughter calmly says that she has thought about it and would like to hit her the mother agrees to this they both stand up and instead of a well primed slap the daughter clenches her fist and delivers a boxer's blow argh
<START> this movie should have never been made from the poorly done animation to the beyond bad acting i am not sure at what point the people behind this movie said ok looks good lets do it i was in awe of how truly horrid this movie was at one point which very may well have been the worst point a computer generated saber tooth of gold falls from the roof stabbing the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth uh ooookkkk the villain of the movie was a paralyzed sabretooth that was killed within minutes of its first appearance the other two manages to kill a handful of people prior to being burned and gunned down then there is a random one awaiting victims in the jungle which scares me for one sole reason will there be a part two god for the sake of humans everywhere i hope not br br this movie was pure garbage from the power point esquire credits to the slide show ending
<START> this movie is about basically human relations and the interaction between them the main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life starts a journey to her past doing an analysis of how she lived her life this journey is precipitated because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a nursing home it is a very honest look to some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life and there is plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this movie such as family legacy real love marriage or destiny although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas there is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very believable but because of the time some characters are maybe not fully developed i really recommend this movie for a quiet saturday afternoon
<START> first off this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around if one were to look back after the film it really wasn't meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac but really thats all it was aiming for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions br br i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific in non shock sense it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid pessimistic i didn't trust anyone for about a week because i didn't want to wake up strung up and tortured
<START> ohhh man now this is what i'm talking about as far as bad cheesy horror flicks go this movie was truly in a class of its own a real gem br br first off the film wasn't originally in english that's okay because the voice dubbing was truly exceptional here is my favorite excerpt from the dialog and there is plenty more where this came from Â i'm feeling a little better i'm just thirstyÂ for your blood br br and what drama here is a play by play recap of the interaction between the military and scientistsÂ br br scene 1Â scientist you can't do thatÂ it'll be a disaster military officer that's just science fiction he then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just like the scientist predicted br br scene 2Â scientist if you do that many people will die military officer you don't know what you're talking about he does it and many people die br br scene 3Â scientist don't do thatÂ it'll kill everyone military officer that's nonsense he then proceeds to kill everyone br br scene 4 5 6 7Â you get the idea br br if that wasn't enoughÂ there were a few scenes that really stood out as instant classics in one scene the military has literally 10 guys pointing guns at two unarmed men the leader yells go get 'em and all 10 army guys one at a time drop their guns and fist fight the two adversaries instant classic br br and don't worry no attention to detail was left out this movie even had a hip upbeat '80's keyboard synth soundtrack to set the mood br br and trust meÂ i realize this review might contain some spoilers but there are so many goodies in this epic i really only scratched the surface a movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade a true movie watching experience a masterpiece wow
<START> while to most people watching the movie this will be of little interest but out of the many hundreds of movies dealing with magic and the occult in one form or another this one is probably the best in many ways br br from the golem to the craft the subject seems to be of endless interest to the movie industry the majority of movies which touch on it in any way do so childishly for example witchboard a true piece of utter garbage in every way either taking the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for cheesy special effects or cardboard cutout villians cf warlock more frequently the subject comes up in an hysterical religious context in the various revelations oriented movies the antichrist is inevitably an advocate of some kind of new age style practice rarely a movie seems to show at least some passing experience with magic as it is practiced in real life but the presentation of the occult in such movies can at best be described as allegorical and not literal or symbolic or just not quite right br br i watched this movie again after many years tonight i had seen it before on vhs it is a dark moody piece and after watching it on dvd i would say if you have any intention to watch this movie watch it on dvd don't watch it on vhs br br the darkness and moodiness are overpowering in vhs but in dvd the movie takes on a very different tone i think weir pushed the dark aspects intentionally for style but when the movie is converted to the lower color medium of vhs this goes over the edge dvd brings the movie to life again and i saw it differently br br anyway seeing it as if for the first time i realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this movie it's difficult to go into all the reasons why i don't care to take the time to do so br br for anybody who's curious anyway if you want to see what it is like in real life this movie is just very right on countless levels br br and for anybody who isn't you really wasted a lot of time reading to this point
<START> this familiar story of an older man younger woman is surprisingly hard edged bikers hippies free love and jail bait mix surprisingly well in this forgotten black and white indie effort lead actress patricia wymer as the titular candy gives the finest performance of her career spanning all of 3 drive in epics wymer was precocious and fetching in the young graduates 1971 but gives a more serious performance in the babysitter the occasional violence and periodic nudity are somewhat surprising but well handled by the director leads wymer and george e carey sell the may december romance believably there are enough similarities between the babysitter and the young graduates to make one wonder if the same director helmed the latter film as well patricia wymer where are you br br hailing from seattle wa miss wymer had appeared as a dancer on the tv rock and roll show malibu u before gracing the cover as well as appearing in an eight page spread of the august 1968 issue of best for men a tasteful adults only magazine she also appeared as a coven witch in the popular 1969 cult drive in shocker the witchmaker br br the babysitter has finally made its home video debut as part of the eight film bci box set drive in cult classics vol 3 which is available from amazon com and some retail stores such as best buy
<START> if there was some weird inversed oscar academy awards festival this flick would win it all it has all the gods excellent plot extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar well this could be the scenario if the world was inversed but it's not instead it's the worst horror flick ever made not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia but also extremely low on special effects for example the devil costume which by the way is a must see is something of the most hilarious i've ever seen whenever i saw that red black so called monster on screen i couldn't hold my laugh back and to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyor belt br br do not do the same mistake as i did checking imdb seeing that the movie was released in 2003 had less than five votes and thinking well it's worth a shot can't be that bad br br yes it could br br i'm not even going to waste more words on this movie
<START> made after quartet was trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham here the three stories are the verger mr know it all and sanitorium the first two are comic the verger is like a prolonged joke but one with a good pay off and the last more serious as health issues are involved again the author introduces the film and the stories br br james hayter soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick is the hero in the verger he holds this small custodial type job in a church but the new vicar michael hordern is an intellectual snob when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him hayter has saved some money so he tells his wife kathleen harrison he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop he has a good eye and his store thrives soon he has a whole chain of stores when his grandchild is christened by hordern the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex verger the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments i'll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting br br according to maugham he met a man like max kelada nigel patrick on a cruise in mr know it all kelada is a splashy friendly and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip regarding jewelry by steamship his state room mate is mr grey the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde white who is somewhat silently disapproving of max max likes to enliven things and soon is heavily involved in the ship's entertainment at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non maugham story and film china seas 1935 as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real i won't describe the way max rises to the occasion br br sanitorium is the longest segment roland culver plays ashenden the fictional alter ego of maugham a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock's the secret agent here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health he finds a remarkable crew of people including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman finlay currie as an irascible scotsman john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is at war with currie raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions the last dealing with simmons and rennie is ironic but deeply moving br br it was a dandy follow up to the earlier quartet and well worth watching
<START> as if most people didn't already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm a successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife going down on the pool man on their anniversary of all days and snaps big time into a furious breakdown after shooting an attack dog's head off he strolls into work and ends up taking his marital aggression out on the patients as he plans what to do about his slut of a wife there are plenty of up close shots of mouth jabbing tongue cutting and beauty queen fondling as well as a marvelously deranged performance by corbin bernsen the scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch a dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail the dentist is incredibly entertaining fast paced and laughably gory at times check it out
<START> i'm not kidding about that summary and vote the video distributors have packaged this as just another typical '80s werewolf movie but it is in fact the greatest parody of the horror genre that you can imagine having done for the horror movie what blazing saddles did for the western i have seen plenty of comedies good bad stupid weird etc usually walking away unimpressed and i think that comedy must be the most difficult genre for filmmakers and actors to work in it takes just the right kind of touch to make things successful and part of that is having good ideas full moon high is bulging with good ideas so many in fact that it can easily put the zucker abrams team of airplane and naked gun to shame one of the best of these is the very presence of ed mcmahon in a starring role as a john birch style right wing crackpot the jokes non sequiturs wisecracks and word play are literally non stop and everything including the kitchen sink has been thrown in the ironic tone is very similar to that of back to the future br br some people i e almost every reviewer here must have been turned off by the spirit of anarchy here but i almost died of laughter and this is one of those movies in which you never know what kind of insane situation will transpire next since b movie extraordinaire larry cohen had not made a straight comedy before this one gets the sense that he was making up for lost time by including any joke he or his collaborators could think of if mel brooks had made this the critics would have labelled it a comic masterpiece but because it was made by cohen it has been dismissed as schlock critical reviews have called this movie too silly silly what is a comedy supposed to be serious anyway i laughed out loud more for this movie than any other i can think of cohen makes fun of everyone himself included with plenty of references to his usual brand of low rent film making he and the actors must have had a complete blast making this br br the humor is very mel brooks ish and anyone who loves jewish humor or watches a lot of b movies especially horror will love this trust me the movie isn't too hard to find and as long as you accept it for what it is a roller coaster of belly laughs with no pretense of social value whatsoever then you'll truly enjoy it br br one sidenote this movie should somehow go down in history as the one thing bob saget ever starred in albeit briefly that was actually funny
<START> louis sachar's compelling children's classic is about as disney as freddy krueger it's got murder racism facial disfigurement and killer lizards br br tightly plotted it's a multi layered interlinking story that spans history to reveal stanley's own heritage and the secret behind the holes it races from latvia's lush greenness to the pock marked camp green lake hint there's no lake and no green br br disney's first success is re creating the novel's environments so convincingly the set design is superb and without gloss the other plus is in the casting rising star shia labeouf charlie's angels 2 project greenlight might not be the fat boy of the book but his attitude is right and he's far from the usual clean cut hero the rest of the cast is filled out equally well from patricia arquette as the frontier school marm turned bank robber to henry winkler as stanley's dad the downside is the pop soundtrack pure marketing department and having the sentiment turned up to full volume at the end
<START> the main problem with the documentary czech dream is that isn't really saying what it thinks it's saying br br in an audacious i hesitate to use the word inspired act of street theater vit klusak and filip remunda two student filmmakers from the czech republic pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie they deliberately fabricated a phony hypermarket the eastern european equivalent of costco or wal mart super store built an entire ad campaign around it replete with billboards radio and tv spots an official logo a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise and then waited around to see just how many dopes would show up to their creation on opening day they even built a makeshift faÃ§ade to convince people that the store itself actually existed br br one might well ask why do such a thing well that's a very good question but the answer the filmmakers provide isn't all that satisfying a one essentially we're told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something even something that's not true simply through the power of advertising and the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the real i e higher purpose for the charade is to convince the czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the european union fair enough especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of research into what does and does not work in advertising in a way by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse br br but in many ways the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it for it is they themselves and not the good hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot and what is all this supposed to prove anyway that people are greedy because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains or that they're stupid and gullible because they don't suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world br br no i'm afraid this smart alecky nasty little stunt only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots and indeed many of them when they finally discover the trick that's been played on them react with a graciousness and good humor i'm not sure i would be able to muster were i to find myself in their position br br i'm not saying that the movie isn't gripping something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action but when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red faced and empty handed to their homes we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed
<START> a woman who hates cats alice krige and her son brian krause have moved into a small town and must deal with a mean teacher glenn shadix their incestuous relationship a lovely girl mÃ¤dchen amick and one hell of a big secret br br okay so technically this is a bad film but who cares it's so very fun br br impossible things involving corn happen people freak out about kitty cats there's bad one liners there's too much cheese to handle br br so yes you will enjoy this a lot it won't move you touch you scare you or thrill you in any way but it will keep you entertained and laughing
