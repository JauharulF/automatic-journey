<START> it was fabulous the photography editing cinematography music combined to transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination it was the enjoyment of slumming without going through the danger we were there the dream sequences and flashback sequence ending were fresh it spoke to me keep up the good work another of that genre is city of god also don't laugh the comedy desperately seeking susan nice ensemble types with great performances by all sorry i think training day fits that genre as well with fantastic performances by an ensemble cast i had to switch the channel on some of the gritty sequences but all in all a great film
<START> the lovely danish actress sonja richter steals this film from under the noses of everyone no small feat considering the terrific performances surrounding her br br richter plays anna an out of work independent minded somewhat neurotic and perhaps suicidal actress who lands a desperation job looking after a wheelchair bound muted aged father named walentin the great danish actor frits helmuth who died at 77 shortly after this film was made br br spoiler alert br br walentin refuses to respond to anyone until he confronts the gifted anna whose whimsical and mischievous manner brings the poor old battered devil back from a self imposed death sentence br br writer director actor eric clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty a ponderous businessman son jorgen played by clausen has loving a father who has never accepted him the film sags toward the end but clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia the nature and value of loving and caring and how one person the irrepressible anna can alter the course of a human life highly recommended sonja richter's performance is alone worth the price of admission
<START> i found it highly interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own american culture and that of the originators i e chinese it becomes a story about values and causes the watcher to reevaluate their own choices in life and loyalties toward institutions amazingly enough it managed to do this in a gentle mildly humorous manner which only in retrospect seens threatening to one's status quo i enjoyed the movie and would watch it again if i could
<START> second movie in the boxset originally titled bloodsuckers this movie was pretty average it is kinda boring in some parts but there is some good gore effects but they're not great though br br the movie takes place in the year 2210 vampires have pretty much taken over the whole world the v san vampire sanitation squad which also has their own spaceship and is lead by churchill who is captured by the vampires receives a message from an earth and the team formed by quintana played by the very hot natassia malthe the rookie officer damian and the rebels rosa and roman roman being played by aaron pearl from wrongfully accused v san later meets up with the leader of the vampires muco played by michael ironside from total recall he has no plans of living peacefully with humans as he is bent on world domination br br while this movie was not a waste of time i doubt i'll be putting back in the dvd player anytime soon
<START> i am a huge fan of vonnegut's work and i'm very fond of this movie but i wouldn't say that this is a film of the mother night that i read when people say that vonnegut is unfilmable two things come to my mind one is that many of his themes are very near the knuckle or even taboo despite the accusation sometimes used against him that he chooses relatively easy targets for his satire this means less every day that passes as far as filmability is concerned directors these days appear to revel in breaking taboos and i have high hopes for the version of bluebeard now in production amazing to think that an innocent piece like vonnegut's sirens of titan would probably have been the equivalent of r rated if filmed when it was published back in the 50s for its violence language and sexual and thematic content though it's a tragedy that nobody's come up yet with a filmable script for it and in the present economic climate i also hope some director out there is looking closely at jailbird galapagos and hocus pocus br br the other thing is his narrative style heaping irony upon irony upon irony but still making it hilariously funny it seems impossible to objectify and that appears to be the biggest obstacle to making great films of his great novels because the little authorial comments that colour our response as readers are just not possible in movies without resorting to too often clumsy techniques like talkovers vonnegut suggested that there was a character missing from filmed versions of his work himself as author narrator to its credit breakfast of champions the movie tried to keep the comedy and came a bit of a cropper for its pains as did another turkey made from a vonnegut novel slapstick in an even more spectacular way br br still there's nothing wrong with a director giving us his subjective interpretation of vonnegut and mother night is an excellent example of how as another reviewer put it a good director can add a visual poetry to a source like this but so much of the humour is lost that though it's the same plot it's not really from the same novel i read if it had been i'd probably have been rolling in the aisles laughing a few times watching it for a reader of the novel i think a chuckle even at the end is forgivable the end of the film however is truly poignant and i think one of the film's successes is that it can genuinely leave you feeling that you've watched someone walk a razor's edge between good and evil and the jury is still out br br standing alone and of itself it's well worth a look technically there are some minor but glaring errors notably in continuity and it too often looks drab and theatrical but most of the time it hits an acceptable note and occasionally shows considerable imagination and resourcefulness the acting in general is of a high order even if maybe the dialogue is by today's standards a little stilted br br it survives quite well watching back to back with slaughterhouse 5 and there is actually quite a bit more good filmed vonnegut out there mostly versions of his short stories harrison bergeron who am i this time and some other things like of course the misfiring filmed version of his very funny but disposable play happy birthday wanda june also there was an interesting piece if it still exists done in the 70s called between time and timbuktu which vonnegut apparently didn't like much although he was involved in its production because he felt it misinterpreted him in its generality he said it reminded him of the bizarre surgical experiments performed in the hg wells tale the island of dr moreau but it did for many people serve as an excellent introduction to his work br br but if the films don't make you want to go to the superior source material they're not doing their job br br as the man said more or less the big show is inside your head
<START> i have to mention two failures for you to understand that this movie brilliantly succeeded where they failed a scanner darkly and immortel ad vitam if you were excited by the concepts of these two movies and felt woefully disappointed like me you will probably enjoy renaissance it immerses you into the world of a future paris it is not quite dystopian they did the animation so well that i thought it was rotoscoped but from what i can tell it was not it was merely motion capture the facial expressions are amazing not since tron have i seen a fantasy world so well displayed in an animation live hybrid the black and white medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the subject of the scene my favorite effect was what they did with headlight beams watch for it the director plays with your attention and confusion but you are satisfied eventually by finding the thread that he wants you to find the overall effect is a harsh and gritty urban world filled with small surprises br br the plot is secondary but it isn't terrible it is noir ish there is a backstory for most of the major characters giving them some depth there is weather there are sets so you can feel like you are in different places in paris there is some action and even a car chase i am going to have to see this one again to get everything i also recommend a very large screen to view it as the sets are detailed and the credits are small
<START> as an inspiring director myself this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind shot with low end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for dof the editing is good acting decent sound effects aren't too over the top i would have give it a 7 for an indie film but the story aren't that interesting it's more on the drama side character developments than a horror flick br br it's not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy br br honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50's br br this movie is about a family who has a dry field and that is just that
<START> at the beginning we get to see the start of a secret council of some sorts it all looks very promising from the get go with some supernatural elements thrown in the mystery gets more interesting by the minute the main character who seems like a good bloke gets into trouble because of his claim for money he is entitled to temptation and other factors you really empathize with the guy and you want to know what exactly is going on normally a person in his situation would have several options somehow he does not have those options in this movie there only seems to be one solution even when it is clear it is not his fault out of the blue he encounters characters who talk about church prayer and god and they provide the answer for his problem it should be obvious at a point in the movie what this solution is now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message since it always is helpful but was it really necessary to disguise this message this religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me while the message is good it's simplicity can't escape the fact that in real life more needs to happen to resolve issues presented in this movie the mystery that is presented to us never gets solved in stead you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot don't get fooled because of malcolm mcdowell the once brilliant actor is adequate but if you watch closely you will see that he is not serious at all he really must be desperate for money otherwise what would posses an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like this
<START> elvis has left the building and he's lucky because he didn't have to watch this unfunny stinker scene after scene director joel zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing filled with unfunny deaths trite gay characteratures and hack jokes this film is more desperate than amusing this is the sort of film that makes one hope kim basinger follows doris day into premature retirement let us remember her the way she was talented and not what she's become david leisure the delicious dennis richards and the rest are all wasted talents here zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn the guy playing elvis sounds more like gomer than the king the only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays basinger as a preteen she really looks like her and is actually pretty good the only other reason to watch this film at all is to look for the tom hanks cameo the cameo isn't all that funny but at least its not painful one has to wonder if zwick has incriminating pictures of hanks or something that would make him do this movie
<START> when i come on imdb boards i'm always fed up when i see a the worst movie ever post after watching this movie i think that i am soon going to create my own post br br the opening titles great some kind of lame zoom on a gas oven yeah focus on the fire explosions great action packed movie br br the actors i think that ice t is a cool rapper even a nice actor sometimes i insist sometimes but the steven seagal like policeman he plays is beyond the words the rest of the cast is well i don't know where those actors were hired but jeez i bet my dog would have been a much better actor than them br br the plot hijacking original isn't it br br the action sequences the first shot of the movie is an explosion i told myself well cool at least there will be some nice pyrotechnics i was dead wrong the rest of the movie is mostly filled with low rent stock shots taken from the air force br br the dialogs are hilarious the music is pure crap the end is happy i mean i was happy at the end because the movie was over br br my cousin who was watching the movie was delighted i'm 22 she's 42 well i was on the verge of taking the movie and burn it maybe next time i'm gonna watch it who said never
<START> this is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind tsui hark it is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to steven chow's shaolin soccer from the moment the movie started there was astronishing backdrops at every edge which were br br deplicted with superb style if you are a science fiction or chinese martial arts geek you'll love the excessive amounts of many 3d effects and realistic computer generated weapons there comes a fine performance as always from ekin cheung who plays sky king he teams up with louis koo red who i was very impressed by his flexible wing which deflected incoming attacks the fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way not only is the action superb but the has a somewhat complex storyline many criticisers of this movie complain of the lack of story theme or just shoved in random bits of debrise and even describe as the legend of poo however the viewer cannot rely on watching dragon ballz and other similar manga cartoons to understand this movie others who are famarialy with wu xia movies will have a better appoach in due respect there can be one weakness that could be foreseen the blow that was deliveried to the enemy at the very last fight scene could of been more substantially and devastiingly made in spite of all this its a must see
<START> leon was fantastic as always this time playing little richard in his early years the movie showed a fully fleshed out little richard without neglecting to fill the show with lots of great music my only complaint is that the ending was a little abrupt i was hoping for a 2 parter
<START> it was only on my second viewing years later that i realized two things about this movie 1 i enjoyed it immensely and 2 that because its execution is decidedly sharper than the premise itself warrants i had laughed my way through the movie before it occurred to me to renew my initial protests valleyspeak and loogies and airheadedness even good natured airheadedness just aren't inherently funny especially when drawn out to feature length but though the movie's momentum does begin to sputter out towards the end reeves and winter and sadler and hal landon jr in an unforgettable scene display such a remarkable sense of comic timing throughout that even the more clumsily scripted jokes e g ted failing to recognize a certain inhabitant of hell work as effortlessly as the witter ones e g the challenge and the teaming of winter and reeves clicks so well that the teaming of bill and ted who spend only one scene separated in the entire movie disaster if they're not well matched appears utterly unstrained br br side note i found the first movie to be only sporadically entertaining sightly different comic sensibilities there it seems br br i give it a 7 75 surprisingly good fun
<START> i never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel especially a beloved one like evening but when i saw that the book's author susan minot was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film i thought that evening would be a good adaptation br br if you enjoyed the book don't bother with this movie it is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another br br here our characters are completely different the bride is in love with harris harris is the son of the housekeeper buddy is a drunk in love with ann and or harris i don't think a single character made it from the book to the screen oh it just gets worst with every passing moment br br and really didn't we learn from bridges of madison county that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in to scenes of our heroes' grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights simply does not work on film this film is a disaster skip it
<START> the 700 club has to be the single most bigoted television program in the history of television itself to make matters worse it's been on the air since 1966 implying that thousands if not millions of people are buying into its hate and lies headed by pat robertson the unscrupulous megalomaniacal founder and leader of the christian coalition the 700 club takes us from misinformation to misunderstanding broadcasting news as they like to think of it and trying to convince its audience that all of the world's problems are to blame on homosexuals wiccans new age spiritualists muslims jews hindus non fundamentalist christians democrats single mothers foreigners feminists evolutionists environmentalists nasa scientists and anyone else who doesn't share their fanatical religious views it's actually the best fake news since the daily show or the weekend update segment of saturday night live or since fox news for that matter of course pat's always the one who makes each of the decisions saying whatever comes to mind and not giving a damn who it offends or hurts in the meantime he continues his part in the struggle to transform the united states into a militarized police state by having the religious wrong stick their noses in everything they can and asking for one donation after another no less than a measly 100 to become a member by the way to fund pat's african diamond mines and buy oil from companies reprimanded by the government in the past for their abuse of the environment no never mind that pat was good friends with the genocidal dictators of zaire and zimbabwe in order to help him acquire such wealth it's all for the greater glory of god don't you know and of course the hosts of the 700 club are always willing to read letters written by viewers as they like to put it coincidentally each typed in the same format and all on the same color of paper by viewers supposedly healed of various afflictions by the said hosts they claim to have words of knowledge come to them but who never appear on the program to say what happened to them honestly how can anyone take a show seriously when they're using a poor applause recording it should make people wonder why there's no studio audience br br the sad thing that pat's cronies and viewers don't realize or just don't want to realize are the horrible things he's done and said this is a guy who agreed with jerry falwell that the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states were the result of god punishing us for our acceptance of homosexuality and feminism ironic considering that pat has twice publicly referred to the implementation of a nuclear weapon in the state department i have little doubt it was his wealth that kept him from getting arrested for such statements his rants against homosexuals single mothers and any number of sexual practices he considers sinful are interesting considering he was known to frequent a number of brothels during the korean war as the bible says be fruitful and multiply so congratulations pat thanks to you there's probably a number of children born to single korean mothers then of course there was the time he called for the assassination of venezuelan president hugo chavez not that he's a saint but still oh yes and let's not soon forget the time this crusader for human life supported forced abortions in china very christian of him wouldn't you say br br and just in case pat has forgotten i haven't forgotten his little speech that evangelical christians today are being treated exactly as the jews were in nazi germany honestly to compare his plight to the horrors of the holocaust is almost unforgivable speaking of which need i mention about how he blatantly lied that homosexuality ran rampant among the nazi party in a pathetic attempt to discredit homosexuals of course history shows us that the nazis acted toward homosexuals the same way they acted toward jews pat robertson is one of the biggest liars in history if he was pinocchio his nose would encircle the earth br br unfortunately more and more people continue to believe him every day this is your wake up call people the 700 club is one of the most if not the single most vile program in television history it's evil masquerading as good it's a wolf in sheep's clothing it's bigoted filth that tries to look clean pretty and loving it's living proof that hateful dangerous religious views aren't confined to certain groups in the middle east even those who are not of the christian faith know that it goes against everything jesus taught and if jesus was to appear to this club he wouldn't be emulating them instead he'd be chastising them as he did the pharisees of his time and overturning the money bins of their telethons as he did in front of the synagogue in his time all i can say is thank god that pat had no chance of becoming president if he did he'd be the harbinger of armageddon and not on the side of the good guys
<START> george lopez in my opinion is an absolute abc classic i haven't seen every episode but i still enjoy it there are many episodes that i enjoyed one of them was where amy sandra bullock walked into a moving piece of machinery if you want to know why you'll have to have seen it for yourself before i wrap this up i'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though new episodes can currently be seen i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
<START> only a 9 10 from me a perfect ten would have been if there was more of a plot to the movie but nevertheless moonwalker to this day remains a fun fest of music dance and entertainment beginning with the montage of video clips from jackson's long career it reminds the viewer of just why he is often regarded as 'the king of pop' from his hit 'i want you back' to 'we are the world' the multi award winning charity record for the benefit of africa following this a short movie of sorts although lacklustre in an oscar winning script nonetheless provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience ending with a perfect sexy rendition of 'come together' something the whole family can watch and enjoy
<START> this is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a canadian we grow good wine our writers and poets are among the world's best the national ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world but we make bloody awful movies this one isn't especially bad it's especially typical and typically bad shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction high school level acting and gee whiz lets see what this button on the camera does photography if michael moriarity was so intent on doing a jack nicholson impersonation couldn't he at least have done a good jack nicholson impersonation and if the movie was shot in vancouver truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building part of the plot why in god's name do we let that endemic canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as seattle not only am i mad about this film i'm embarassed and more than a little ashamed the australians turn out some splendid stuff we produce pretentious second rate piffle gawd
<START> ok not possibly honestly the worst movie i've ever seen br br this made absolutely no sense there was no plot no characterization no acting just nothing br br here's what i thought when i first saw it may 28th 2003 caution this is a spoiler alert it's also alot of me complaining about how bad the movie is br br ok so the movie begins and the characters are introduced but there is no character explanation as far as i knew the main character was new to this school but apparently not also it appeared that he lived by himself then that he was a foster kid then that his mother was a raging alcoholic who lived with him still also all his friends apparently had no parents and lived by themselves br br now we come to a main plot point this insane guy has broken out of the insane asylum and is running rampant now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focus' intently on him for the contingency of the movie i think i must have missed a main plot element here there was no reason for the main character to get hooked even if that's the point having no reason why do all his friends who are skeptical like 5 minutes before suddenly follow him and do what he wants br br so the movie continues on and it gets all right they're running havoc on the school blah blah blah but wait a minute suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the 'show' here wait a second didn't the insane guy specifically tell the main character not to do that it was supposed to be anynomous br br ah another important plot element has been skipped over the insane guy was supposed to not be insane everyone said he wasn't insane but as the story goes on he is very clearly out of his mind but i thought the news people said he wasn't hm br br now the movie comes to a close that was the close what the hell was that not only did the ending not answer any questions about the main character it didn't answer any questions about the insane guy are these people in the same situation if yes then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend to this if no then what is the point in saying that's you in two weeks br br end of the thing br br that's what i thought then that is pretty much what i still think now it's 6 months down the line and if i can get it for free i might give it another chance but i doubt it i highly doubt it
<START> i remember back when i was little when i was away at camp and we would campout under the stars there was always someone there that would have a good story to tell that involved the woods that surrounded us and they would always creep me out well when i found wendigo at the library i checked it out hoping to be one of those films that had a supernatural being haunting people in the woods much like the stories that were told at camp well much to my dismay i was so far from the truth wendigo is really bad the story starts of when a family of three is driving to their winter cabin which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods and they run into a deer well it seems the local rednecks were actually hunting this particular deer and are pretty upset at our city folk the movie spends far too much time following the families everyday activities instead of getting to the point of the film it wasn't until about the last 15 minutes that we actually have some action involving the wendigo my suggestion is that you stay very far away this film it will leave you wanting your hour and a half back
