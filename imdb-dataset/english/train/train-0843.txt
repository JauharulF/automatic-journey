<START> having not read the novel i can't tell how faithful this film is the story is typical mystery material killer targets newlyweds woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease yes it sounds like a soap opera and that's exactly how it plays the first 2 3 are dull save for the murders and the last 1 3 makes a partial comeback as it picks up speed toward its twisty conclusion br br acting is strictly sub par though it's hard to blame the actors alone the screenplay is atrocious during the last 1 3 you stop noticing because the film actually becomes interesting but that's only the last 1 3 director russell mulcahy is very much in his element but there's only so much he can do with a tv budget and the network censors on his back he's pretty much limited to quick cutting and distorted lenses though he managed to squeeze in a couple under the floor shots during the murders in the club restroom unfortunately as this is made for tv the cool compositional details he uses so well with a wider image are nowhere to be found note to producers give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire him br br summing it up this film is bad by cinema standards and mediocre by tv standards watch csi instead if you're in the mood for a film like this i've some excellent suggestions pick up a copy of dario argento's deep red my highest recommendation superb film opera or even tenebre they're stronger in every category
<START> 'moonstruck' is a love story there is not one romance there are at least three but they all have to do with the same family loretta's family loretta cher is about to marry johnny cammareri danny aiello she doesn't love him but he is sweet and good man when he leaves to visit his dying mother in italy loretta meets johnny's brother ronny nicolas cage he and johnny haven't spoken each other in five years and loretta wants to invite him to the wedding of course they fall instantly for each other br br how this story and love stories of loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself every seen is a delight to watch with cher as the bright star in the middle of everything she won and really deserved the oscar that year cage is pretty good and goofy as well and olympia dukakis as loretta's mother and vincent gardenia as her father are terrific this movie is funny charming and therefore highly enjoyable
<START> warning may contain spoilers my huge problem with this movie is how totally self centered and self consumed the adulteress wife is after having a one night stand with a slimy psycho she is being stalked by him he calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends a video of their night together he is obviously crazy and very dangerous the problem is she only thinks he is dangerous to her and exposing her secret not for one second did she ever have one thought of concern for her husband did she even for a moment think of him possibly being in danger from this psychotic as soon as she realized how mental he was she should have warned her husband no matter what the consequences maybe there wouldn't have been a movie then but there really wasn't one anyway so what's the difference
<START> a must see for anyone who loves photography stunning and breathtaking leaves you in ore seen it twice once in a cinema and now on dvd it holds up well on dvd but on the big screen this was something else br br took my two daughters to see this and they loved it my oldest cried at the end but she was the one who wanted to see it again tonight when she saw it at the video shop its simple telling of a child's love for nature and in particular a fox is told well in some ways it reminded me of the bear in its telling a story not documentary formate which works for children very well not being preached to is very important you make your own mind up br br but the star of this film is the cinematographers how did they do what they did amazing just amazing
<START> i am a huge stooges fan but the one and only redeeming quality this movie has is that curley is in it done long before he started drinking heavily he is his classic self in this and larry's not bad either moe's character is a straight part mostly and this movie would be better named the curley and larry movie not that any of the stooges movies were very good in my opinion but as one commenter here said how sad it is that this movie had real potential the casting was good it was well directed filmed and edited but the story line tried to be about something serious with just some stooges antics and musical numbers which i guess were good back then thrown in the best thing you can do for yourself during this movie should you actually believe that it has to be better than mowing the lawn and taking out the trash which is subject to debate is to wait for curley larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat during the rest of it
<START> this is what we can do to each other this is the sort that everbody should see at least once br br it does not glorify world it shows that it is the everyday person who is killed mained and debased by war the person on the other side eats sleeps laughs and cry just as we do
<START> i picked this up at the video store because of tarantino's recommendation if you don't like this go f yourself on the box seemed like a ringing endorsement i was expecting something a bit more like death proof not much actual violence in this one tho or plot of character or dialogue br br look at the poster it's all there stunts and rock it goes back and forth a week or so in the life of an la band that does a crappy magic show at a level that you'd maybe see in one of the lesser casinos off the strip and an aussie stuntman new in town finding his feet they work they meet girls they party end of story br br the band obviously needed all that stuff because they are frankly second tier and playing a style that was already dated in 1978 it has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are genuinely spinetingling that aussie fellow really is something and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for the art i hung it there to see what crazy thing he'd do next just wish he could have found a better vehicle
<START> the devil's plaything is my second attempt at a joseph sarno production and although i will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and unerotic swedish wildcats it is still a little slow and un explicit for my taste br br this one centers around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle that want to resurrect their previously murdered leader in order to do so the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and chant weird stuff and of course drink some blood too when a doctor and her brother's car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for lodging they provide the ideal bloodbank for the horny vampires but they may not be as helpless as they seem br br the devil's plaything is a pretty good example of early 70's exploit sleaze lots of nudity including some full frontal some sleazy undertones including incest and of course lesbo bloodsucking but these scenes are still pretty tame by today's standards some pretty hot women in this one would have benefited from some more explicit sex but i guess ya can't have it all also would have benefited from some heavier violence gore being that it is a vampire film but i think the purpose of the devil's plaything was more to showcase skin not blood still a little slow and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden but that's to be expected from something from this era and of this budget worth a look to exploit fans others may find it a little too dull for their liking 7 10
<START> i am one of jehovah's witnesses and i also work in an acute care medical facility over the years i have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions have attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogens and have seen several patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood i have also heard several jehovah's witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field i have never actually seen it happen leaving the question is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community at large benefiting from the battle on this issue the issue for jehovah's witnesses is a moral one you must abstain from blood is not an ambiguous statement thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it
<START> this is a film that everyone should watch quite apart from raising hugely important points while south africa is on the road to recovery there are still many countries in similar situations now it is superbly directed while denzel washington gives in my opinion the best performance in his career so far kline also gives a good performance although perhaps not as stunning as washington's john thaw also puts in a good turn as the chief of police br br there are so many possible areas where a film on apartheid could fall down but all of these have been avoided it would be easy to simply portray white people as the bad guys and black people as the good guys but attenborough has not done this sure there were some white characters who seemed inherently evil such as the captain at the soweto uprising but to add extra dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long some people complain about the length of the film as it is but i think it needs the whole two and a half hours to tell the whole story for it really is an incredible one br br the best scene in the film is that of steve biko's funeral when the whole crowd begins to sing the south african national anthem it is probably one of if not the most moving scenes i have seen br br if you haven't seen this film already watch it it may not be comfortable viewing but it's certainly worth it
<START> i've watched it plenty of times and i'm planning on buying the full feature i love all of jason steele's comedy it's very different and unique and is very enjoyable i love indie films and this one is just great the plot is strange but very funny this short film is about a talking spatula named edward the order of the events are a bit jumbled making this film very interesting to watch at first you see edward fighting the spoons but then the focus changes to earlier in his life this is a silly movie but of course it's still great i highly recommend that you watch this film at www spatulamadness com or www filmcow com it's very funny the humour may not match everybody's taste but watch anyway it'll only take 16 minutes of your time and it's free go watch spatula madness
<START> a long defunct prison shut down for over 20 years is re opened and ethan sharpe the late great character actor lane smith once a guard there is put in place as warden as the prisoners are put to work fixing the place up they're instructed to break into the old execution room this unleashes a fierce spirit that wreaks merciless havoc upon both guards and prisoners cool as can be low key prisoner burke viggo mortensen showing real poise in an early role is thrust into the role of hero br br i know it's a no brainer to praise the film for its atmosphere it was shot in an actual abandoned penitentiary near rawlins wyoming but it elevates this horror film to a higher level it's got a great sense of foreboding established right at the outset director renny harlin made his fourth directorial effort here it got him the nightmare on elm street 4 directing gig and effectively began an impressive career in mainstream action movies thrillers and horror films br br it may have stock characters but it's got a capable cast bringing them to life chelsea field as the young woman vying for prison reform lincoln kilpatrick as weary veteran convict cresus tom everett as restless con rabbitt ivan kane as the outgoing lasagna tommy tiny lister as soft spoken giant tiny and arlen dean snyder as captain horton it's also worth noting as an early acting credit for kane hodder as the vengeful spirit that helped him land the gig of playing jason voorhees in the friday the 13th series br br decent special effects moody lighting courtesy of prolific genre cinematographer mac ahlberg spooky music by richard band and christopher stone great visuals the incredibly gloomy location and an overall flashy and intense presentation help to make it quite entertaining it's nasty gruesome and good fun for a horror fan br br 8 10
<START> this film is so incredibly bad that i almost felt sick watching it up until this point the other installments had at least one good thing about it part 1 was suspenseful and gory part 2 was off beat and entertaining part 3 was interesting with great effects part 4 had great music good special effects and a new entertaining freddy krueger part 5 is more boring than anything i've ever seen before alice a much prettier blond from part 4 is back with her boyfriend dan at parts this supposed elm street installment turns into a daytime soap the newer characters seem harsh and even that sweet alice has a chip on her shoulder freddy seems to be completely out of this one he looks tired and doesn't seem to be as gruesome his one liners seem out of place and different where as in part 4 they could be pretty funny leslie bohem's story never gets off the ground and stephen hopkins' direction is so bad that it makes my grandmother look good the whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic it's also confusing and pretty stupid avoid part 5 at all costs
<START> obviously there wasn't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production but the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot i mean brutal on the level of ju dou and other great chinese films i first saw this when i was 14 years old i ran home and begged god to forgive me for everything
<START> home room deals with a columbine like high school shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors their trauma guilt and denial br br spoilers the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage swat commando after shooting the high school killer the film has three protagonists the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young erika christensen and busy philipps br br the two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensues br br erika christensen though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting busy philipps three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence this girl was the part br br it's a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls gus van sant's elephant 2003 though good seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure so much more a loss for an equally traumatized america br br ten out of ten
<START> diane keaton has played a few heavy parts in her many years on the big screen but she's mostly known for the light and fluffy stuff with woody allen such as annie hall she deserves an oscar for best actress in a drama for this effort and it doesn't really matter what the competition was the year it was first shown try and find a scene in which she doesn't appear and it was all heavy drama exhausting in its pace and retakes action all at full speed the make up made her as young as possible and she fit the 30s age category even in close ups but she was playing half her age and at a very fast pace the movie overall was fairly well done staged and shot well with a strong supporting cast but keaton carried the load
<START> this film just goes around in circles and the viewer does not know where they are at first i thought mmmmm could be kinda cool movie this but it just drags on and on and eventually you don't know what's going on the lead female is a good actress and played her role well and the psycho fella is creepy but after a bit you don't really care what happens because this film just drags on shame really this could have turned out a lot better br br would say though that the lead female and psycho fella will have a good career ahead of them but will they remember this film for making them known or for being the film they regret they ever made
<START> i have seen bad films but this took the p made no sense and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds oh and i think one has a low sperm count its that good a welshman plays a sweary cockney a posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy and some lesser lights play dim tarts br br and there are some russian gangsters oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs br br avoid this film like the plague
<START> dynasty revisited in hawaii full of clichÃ©s highly predictable unrealistic and sometimes even stupid if you have nothing better to do however it does provide 40 minutes of simple unpretensive entertainment endless looks at great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular hawaiian scenery on the other hand if you are looking for anything more than that stay away br br oh and by the way if you have ever worked in a hotel or know anything about running one you have two options 1 you will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents hotel business or 2 look at it as science fiction comedy as i did lie back relax and laugh about it
<START> i loved this movie i'm a mexican and was in the least offended by it in fact i think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over mexico it's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse it angers me to read in the news how killers kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells we should have someone like creasy denzel washington's character a bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante kidnapping is flourishing industry down here at least in the big cities i actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one's creasy did his fine job upon that would be so marvelous sorry i am that resentful man on fire is a gripping film that you can't miss it might be hard on some of you if you aren't used to reading subtitles mexicans do that all the time while watching american movies but the effort will be well worth it some of the editing is a bit fuzzy kind of like traffic remember another brilliant take on how corrupt mexico is the movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half i swear you'll be cheering as you watch denzel washington dispatch the wrong doers his performance is nothing short of excellent the ending no spoilers ok is a bit sad but i'm sure you'll like it anyway man on fire is one of the year's best movies a must own for a dvd collection 9 out of 10
