<START> i first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it it's beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time it's difficult to believe this was made in 1946 as the tale is still fresh today and really makes one think i'm not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made in addition the acting is superb and the use of english and american actors quite astounding i recently purchased the dvd so now i'm able to watch whenever i wish i highly recommend anyone interested in post war british films to watch this
<START> my score for this crap 1 10 1 for the technical only everything else is very bad br br another film that makes no sense clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission br br while it's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth they are among the biggest liars on the planet it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic br br we must believe that taking people for morons perhaps it was reason to believe since 99 of the films are crap because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios br br when you look at the price we give oscars we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others br br and oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense but it was not for education and health br br if you still want to listen to this s t press super fast forward button at least 20x
<START> his costume drama is ill cast and without charm br br george sanders was a superb character actor but he is thoroughly implausible here as the lead an eighteenth century rogue known for his philosophy and great good looks his costar is of all people akim tamiroff some frenchman then there's signe hasso in a dark wig as the virginal daughter of a wealthy family carole landis fares best the movie opens with her in silhouette she is a soubrette and a naughty girl at that she disappears for a while but turns up in an improbably situation but she's good she was always an appealing actress here she is cast closest to her usual type of role br br it's meant to be a little naughty kind of ooh la la it ought to have had a light touch but it's a leaden affair from start to finish
<START> we loved the movie i am a mother to two little men i love having a movie i can watch with them where men have integrity and character moveis where money is not the most important thing and family's are forever and love means more then words br br i do wish we saw more of the davis family but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did please don't be over we both wish actors would not change the new actors were good replacement tho br br my 9 year old son loved this movie too asked me to go buy them all he is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something family should all see this move buy it for friends help bring back a time of values we will be reading the books now that we are hooked really hope to see more be blessed happy moving
<START> this movie is wonderful what separates it from other 50's sci fi is the fact that the alien has no features no face eyes anything yet it can't be killed i especially like the idea that this film doesn't take place over a few days it takes place in one night lasting supposedly past midnight it's also scary that once the blob gets on you you can't get it off you're stuck in it as it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body my all time favorite 50's sci fi film and what is sometimes considered the quintessential one i can see why this rocketed steve mcqueen to stardom all this and a catchy theme song how can you go wrong
<START> sure star wars a movie i have seen at least fifty times beats all the others in special effects but this film has every thing else br br it has horror non graphical romance robots witty repartee intelligence surprisingly good special effects and drama br br i saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print and i was amazed at how well it held up today i thought the old 40's style electronics would look hokey but they somehow looked futuristic and moderne br br ann francis in here mostly short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me br br the krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me br br of course we all know that the great bird of the galaxy probably modeled much of star trek from this movie br br no one has yet to beat robby the robot in terms of personality br br sorry r2d2 and c3po br br this movie overall is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to br br honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles
<START> in late 1800s san francisco poor well dressed errol flynn as james j corbett works at a bank and enjoys attending local fights boxing with co worker and drinking buddy jack carson as walter lowrie one day pretty alexis smith as victoria ware walks into the comstock bank where mr flynn works flynn is so taken with ms smith's elegant beauty he offers to carry her withdrawal purse smith is secretly taken with the handsome flynn but is put off by his brashness br br flynn's good deed actually pick up attempt gets him a complimentary membership in the snooty olympic club which conveniently includes a gymnasium with boxing equipment however flynn's presumptuous manner and practical joking he tickles men on the parallel bars irritates club members when an english boxing champ visits the club members endeavor to get flynn to fight the man they are hopeful flynn will resign humiliated by his defeat but flynn wins br br first time producer robert buckner puts together a nice package for warner brothers and director raoul walsh mr buckner was certainly basking in the success of his contribution screenplay to the studio's brilliant yankee doodle dandy unfortunately this story is positively ludicrous there was a gentleman jim this story is supposedly the filming of the real james j corbett's autobiography the roar of the crowd but this movie must be significantly fictionalized br br flynn is a very appealing leading man he maneuvers the script lightly and should have been recognized by the early 1940s as an excellent actor many of flynn's characterizations were are overlooked as great performances and this is one of them smith does well as his feminine interest deftly transmitting her emotions for the viewer director walsh makes the silliness look smooth and extravagant the supporting cast is a treasure trove from boisterous alan hale as pat corbett to walk on lon mccallister paging mr corbett br br gentleman jim 1942 raoul walsh errol flynn alexis smith alan hale
<START> if you are like me then you will love this great coming of age teen movie i think it is up there with mischief book of love high school usa shout calender girl crybaby all great movies set in the lat 50s early 60s and it has a wonderful soundtrack not as many songs as in some of these type of movies but still great it is all so very funny at times and has a great love interest all the young cast are great i wish there were more type of these wonderful movies my favourite movie of all time is back to the future when marty mcfly gos back to 1955 well in these wonderful movies it stays in the fab 50s early 60s there are some movies of this type better than this but not many
<START> princess victoria emily blunt is in line for the throne of england the present king william jim broadbent is not well and may not live long however vicky's scheming mother the duchess of kent miranda richandson and her aide john mark strong want to force victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the regents until she is older since she is only 20 years of age the young lady refuses despite john slapping her around it is another sign that victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country yet when william does pass away shortly after her 21st birthday victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her first she must surround herself with the right advisers to govern wisely she chooses handsome lord melbourne paul bettany who although an older man is mentioned as a suitor for vicky which brings us to the young queen's second major decision sooner than not the young queen should select her future mate as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom for an heir must appear in the coming years meanwhile in germany some distant relatives of the british royal family are hatching some plans as well handsome prince albert rupert friend of the saxon coburg dynasty is prodded by his father to court the young english royal once he arrives at the palace he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual but since he is a minor player on the map of royal match making can he succeed in winning her heart this is a lovely film made even better by a completely winning performance by emily blunt as victoria yes she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily friend too does well as do the other actors including broadbent richardson bettany strong what a repulsive role and the rest also the movie is gorgeously shot costumed and set making it a visual treat in every way if anything is lacking it is an extra dose of dazzle as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic at times with a somewhat unimaginative edit however this is only a minor minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film in short young and old should make time for young victoria it is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings
<START> overall i would have to say that i liked the movie some of the fight scenes are really good especially the fight against leung ka yan one point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an asian to play a black man i mean really talk about bad taste during a fight scene you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing otherwise sammo copies bruce lee's fighting moves perfectly 5 out of 10 stars
<START> let this serve as a warning to anyone wishing to draw attention to themselves in the media by linking their name to that of a well loved and well respected not to say revered author in order to draw attention to their home movies out on dvd br br hyped to the skies by its obviously talentless makers in fact lied about only to be revealed finally as ludicrously inept in every department the fans of wells and of his book have been after the blood of its writer producer director since it appeared on dvd br br many good points have been made by the other comments users on this page particularly the one about using this as a teaching aid for film school students since this film does not even use the basic grammar of scripting editing continuity direction throughout its entire 3 hours running time it is possible the director did show up for the shoot certainly there was no one present who knew even remotely what they were doing br br an ongoing thread continues to evolve on this imdb page which should at least furnish the watchers of this witless drivel with a few laughs for their 9 00 outlay br br much was promised absolutely nothing was delivered except monty python meets war of the worlds with all the humour taken out br br indefensible trash just unbelievable br br there are real independent film makers out there to be checked out people who actually try to work to a high standard instead of flapping their gums about how great their movie is going to be br br people could do worse than keep an eye on brit film maker jake west's evil aliens for example
<START> anyone who has seen 'shine' scott hicks film of the heartbreaking yet ultimately joyful life of the pianist david helfgotts will i am sure realise that 'the soloist' is very poor in comparison it is as slow as a lullaby i took five breaks answering emails just to wake up the depiction of the homeless area way over the top and extremely self indulgent on a par i fear with the awful beach battle depiction in joe wrights other disaster attonment j fox performance was an extremely poor example of acting and lacked credibility from the offset downey on the other hand although struggling with a badly paced film still manages to charm 9is it me or is he turning into george clooney in more ways than one comparing both these well known so called 'star'actors though is unnecessary as the light that shines brightest as far as acting is concerned must be that of 'shine's' geoeffry rush who's brilliant performance definitely shone far brighter in my sky with both 'attonment' and 'the soloist' the written word wins far more prizes for empathy of subject read the book and articles or wait for the dvd its bound to be in the bargain basement soon
<START> i know many people have a special fondness for the alistair sim version of dickens' story but for me this 1984 version is the one to beat my wife and i own a copy of this film on vhs and we watch it together every christmas eve i often remark that we could watch it on halloween too because it's a very creepy ghost story br br scott typecast as scrooge is shudderingly mean and nasty making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving i think it's up there with his performance in patton the spirits are all effective each one creepier than the last watching the dark floating skeletal form of the spirit of christmas yet to come sends shivers down my spine every year and what a supporting cast david warner in particular is in top form as bob cratchit as is susannah york as his wife br br i seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most others but i may be mistaken as it's been several years since i read it regardless this is a terrific christmas classic
<START> i had a really hard time making it through this move it was extermly slow and at times wondered when the plot of the movie would actually come to life br br this movie seemed to flow to slow and i kept on wondering when it was going to end i am normally a person who likes a good indie file every once in a while but this did not satisfy what i was looking for br br it seemed they tried to make to much out of this movie at one point it seemed to turn political which i am not a big fan of in movies if you are looking for a slow moving movie with little to no plot then this is the right movie for you as for me i felt i wasted 2 hours when i could of been doing something else
<START> i remember that the trailer for legend of zu was quite impressive and being a fan of a man called hero my all time favourite storm riders i decided that i must watch this one too i know that there is way to much critcism on ekin cheng's acting ability everywhere but he is my favourite hong kong moviestar so far way better than nicolas tse nevertheless and he is one of the factors that i enjoyed this movie without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end i even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this film they must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that the storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in i guess ekin cheng pulls the girls easily the story is not very intellectual and deep but that is not what you expect when watcing an action movie i wished there were more martial arts action with fists and fist instead of battles with magical abilities but well that's life and it never goes the way you want it to and why did they sound like supersonic planes in the battle through the sky in the end that's way too funny legend of zu cannot be a man called hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that is not a bad thing at all if a company decides to publish games on this movie i will not get suprised as it carries all the videogames elements good work please make more fantasy movies like this
<START> it's hard to put your finger on this one basically i suppose it's a comedy about an idle rich drunk who falls in love with a comparatively poor girl whom he wants to marry at the risk of being disowned by his family br br it has funny moments romantic moments and touching moments dudley moore is funny and somehow makes his self centred character endearing liza minelli is a convincing foil as the the feisty opposite he attracts but john gielgud steals the show as arthur's wonderfully sarcastic butler br br it's corny but great fun with a memorable soundtrack and ran for nearly 3 months at our local fleapit
<START> sky captain may be considered an homage to comic books pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres one contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences i don't think this is at all true one's expectations of the films fiction and serials that captain pays tribute to were entirely different especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children this film is almost completely devoid of the charm and magnetic attraction of those of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama toward the climax of captain law and paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal they take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the contemplation of a fallen foe with 30 seconds left to tragedy of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgency br br one doesn't expect films like this to necessarily make sense one does expect them to be fun thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic captain has almost none remember when law and paltrow are being pursued by the winged creatures and they reach a huge chasm which they cross via a log bridge well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side they can fly the chasm itself means nothing to them the bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape if the land across the chasm is 'forbidden' to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even if br br i know that paltrow and law both of whom have given fine performances in the past were playing types but both were pretty flat only giovanni ribisi who showed himself capable of great nuance here and angelina jolie seemed to give any oomph to their roles although omid djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if he'd only been given the chance he did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wasted br br the film had a great 'look' but there are so many ways in which cgi distracts cgi works best when it is used for the fantastical when it is used to create creatures who don't exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular when it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints there is no real sense of wonder a cgi mountain doesn't have any of the stateliness or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does i know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it wasn't necessarily supposed to look real but shouldn't it feel that way it just didn't br br as for the weak and clichÃ©d script homage is no excuse even so had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable the last samurai was as predictable as the days of the week and i am no fan of tom cruise but it had everything that captain didn't most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that sky captain most definitely did not br br i'd like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the 30's and 40's the original jay garrick flash or green lantern alan scott come to mind as being ripe for such treatment maybe the better more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film it would be hard to be worse
<START> first of all yes animals have emotions if you didn't know that already then i believe you are a moron but let's assume that none of us are morons we all know that animals have emotions and we now want to see how these emotions are manifest in nature correct br br what we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are human the filmmakers search high low for footage of animals engaged in human like behaviour and when it happens they say that monkey is almost human that's actually a direct quote br br everything is in human terms they waste time theorizing about what makes dogs smile but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means the arrogance of these researchers is disgusting they even go so far as to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hat br br i had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms i wanted to learn how animals emote in their own languages but instead researchers keep falling back on pedantic anthropomorphic observations and assumptions add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimps celebrating christmas and this was enough to turn my stomach br br but it doesn't end there half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities all the camera shots of chimps are through steel bars and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their sterile concrete cages one particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning though you have to be quick to notice it where a captive monkey says in sign language want out hurry go br br obscure references are made to stress tests and psychological experiments which i shudder to imagine baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given wireframe dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys crave a mother figure and after 40 years of experiments the smug researchers pat themselves on the back for reaching their brilliant conclusion monkeys have emotions br br one chimp named washoe has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose and to this day she remains thus we get a brief glimpse again through bars of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather lackluster expression personally i don't need to see any further experimental data washoe i apologize for our entire species
<START> mario lewis of the competitive enterprise institute has written a definitive 120 page point by point line by line refutation of this mendacious film which should be titled a convenient lie the website address where his debunking report which is titled a skeptic's guide to an inconvenient truth can be found at is www cei org a shorter 10 page version can be found at www cei org pdf 5539 pdf once you read those demolitions you'll realize that alleged global warming is no more real or dangerous than the y2k scare of 1999 which gore also endorsed as he did the pseudo scientific film the day after tomorrow which was based on a book written by alleged ufo abductee whitley strieber as james the amazing randi does to psychics and philip klass does to ufos and gerald posner does to jfk conspir idiocy theories so does mario lewis does to al gore's movie and the whole global warming scam
<START> i don't know if this is one of the syfy channel original movies but that's exactly what it feels like a cheap low budget action movie that was probably made very quickly it contains laughable effects lame dialog and one vaguely faded star to give some name brand recognition to it funny how many of the kids from 90210 are doing cheap tv movies now br br ian ziering plays cortes who we know from history as the explorer who wiped out entire populations of native people while conquering parts of north america here he is not played as a hero or even sympathetic but as a slimy opportunist his character would probably be killed off if this weren't loosely based on a historical figure in this story cortes is on a brief surveying mission trying to find something of value to prove he deserves financing to further explore america he and his men find a small tribe of aztecs plagued by dinosaurs br br the actual hero of the story turns out to be lt rios who proves to be honorable resourceful and wise he knows the right thing to do in every situation which puts him at opposition with cortes as well as with the young ambitious aztec shaman of course the native girl who is supposed to marry the headstrong scheming shaman falls for rios furthering his anger towards the spanish outsiders so it's all pretty clichÃ© the dinosaurs are dispatched with relative ease despite taking place in an area that seems wide open the story pretty much takes place in either the woods or the aztec village for 95 of the time so it isn't visually exciting either br br i didn't even recognize ian ziering they gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent and somehow he disappeared into it he doesn't look or sound spanish for a second however making the casting choice wrong in every way if this movie had been released theatrically he would have been singled out for a razzie no question br br overall forgettable
