<START> hello boys and girls this isn't your regular movie review because this is going to be the cold hard truth are you serious this movie sucked so many balls i couldn't keep them out of my mouth they might as well have sprayed me in the eye with monkey semen you'd need one seriously large douche to pump out all the vaginal fluid from this movie br br the plot was very lacking the actors were terrible i rewound the dance number several times and had to pause it even more because i was choking on my own spit do boys everyone br br peace r h besties4lyf
<START> proof why hollywood conventions are in place stale dialogue underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe an attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap together attempt at recreating the magic of arthur penn 's bonnie and clyde 1967 and george roy hill 's butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 truly innovative filmmakers and films but falling well below the bar problems with storylines being self explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections the editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor stills black white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can't transition well or to replace scenes that just didn't work at all and again are reminiscent of butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 br br overly dramatic pauses between sentences random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn't needed for storytelling plus over the top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980's i was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post production the playing of music in most two shots and close ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score no sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots doors footsteps and dialogue a style used in the late 60's through the mid 70's by new directors but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads in my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no 'likeable' characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters i wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the 'hero' a necessity for any story to work for me we know from penn's and hill's movies who the 'heroes' are even though they are criminals we like them and want to see them get away i could care less who was on the screen in this film i got the impression that john milius was trying to give off a non historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding john dillenger's life from june 1933 to july 1934 his death br br to be fair there are some moments of good solid storytelling which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits john milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn't seem to try to 'copy' other filmmakers dillinger 1973 isn't a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial 'big budget' debut but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy br br
<START> and being let down bigger than ever before i won't make any direct references or anything here but to say the least this film is pathetic if you're military trained don't bother watching i put it on the dvd with 2 friends wanting to watch a somewhat interesting action war flick why couldn't i just have read the reviews first br br already at the first bomb scene the film has huge glitches and they continue to show and become bigger and bigger my 2 friends not connected to the military in any way spotted a couple of the filmmaker's mistakes almost as fast as i myself did and asked me if some of the things going on we're realistic well as you might have guessed they're not at all br br avoid this movie unless you're able to overlook these completely idiotic and re occurring mistakes being made 2 10 for catching my interest at first
<START> joel schumaker directs the script he co wrote and has a group of georgetown grads confronted with adult life situations the story line is a scrambled mess but some scenes are actually good there is a lot of wasted talent and time here the cast is more impressive than the movie featured are demi moore rob lowe judd nelson andrew mccarthy emilio estevez ally sheedy and mare winningham the most notable being mccarthy and moore lowe is quite obnoxious coming of age is not so damn easy
<START> one of the greatest westerns of all time but this one unlike many others does not deal with the nature horses shootouts etc but instead deals with one rifle the winchester '73 and how this one rifle effects others and how they effect it a rifle is not a living breathing human being right you may be inclined to believe that it is not but it seems to have a mind of its own for two very similar reasons it gets back to its rightful owner in the end even though that throughout the rest of the picture its unthoughtful owners do their best to make sure it does not and it never seems to be content until it gets back to its original owner so coincidentally the unthoughtful owners always seem to lose it somehow or get killed trying to protect and keep it until it gets back to james stewart then it is content but not every one of the owners deserves to have it stewart does of course since he won it mcnally does not since he had to be a dirty thief and steal it drake definitely does not because he would probably lose it in some poker game and besides drake is too cowardly to fight so why should he have a one of a kind rifle if he will not even use it duryea does not because he is just a chuckling maniac and we all know that chuckling maniacs do not deserve guns this film has a sort of noir edge that only westerns can have such as the ox bow incident westerns have their own type of noir much different than the 30's and 40's bogart films it is hands down the best one out of all five stewart mann westerns even though my personal favorite is bend of the river the other four became much different than this one i do not think it a coincidence to see that the other four were color and this is black and white this is because of the noir edge all five films had the revenge and the dark past on stewart's part play into the film to the point where this is not just stewart's dark side but also actually a sort of character not one to be listed in the credits but one that you can only recognize and know that it is there always present however this one not just on revenge and the dark past but also in terms of supreme danger and characters that were very different than stewart make it surpass the other four in all aspects but stewart never crosses the line he does however walk the line between light and dark this is why black and white played such an integral part in the film they could have all been black and white or they could have all been color but this one is in black and white and the other four are in color and there is a very good reason for that
<START> so we compromised this was a fairly charming film i liked the art direction it felt far more real than most kids movies and the costumes weren't too cutesy the child actors were not bad to watch the adult performances trended toward cheesy it was great that they showed how a bullied kid bullies others as well as kids standing up to bullying br br i don't know how many grown ups would want to see this for themselves but it's a great film to take a kid to and since barnyard was apparently attended by 100 kids at the same time i'm really glad we picked the sparsely attended showing of worms instead
<START> why do i constantly do this to myself i mean really it's right there in the title the incredible melting man what else would i expect i have to admit i'm a sucker for just about anything i come across on the monster hd channel but the only redeeming feature of this picture would be that truly grotesque makeup job by the legendary rick baker as for creepy i'll give the nod to that horny old geezer couple sucking on lemons just before lights out now they were truly scary br br something i could never figure out in horror flicks was why a monster's victims wouldn't simply just run away when faced with virtual annihilation like the chick in the cabin you know there was a door completely visible right there in the kitchen that she could have run right out of at any time incredible steve o couldn't muster much more than a brisk walk so why not just blow right by him i don't know maybe i'm missing something br br this flick had some of the feel of a 'tales from the crypt' episode but 'tales' usually had a cool or grotesque twist which often times you didn't see coming this was one picture that you couldn't quite get a handle on coming or going for example in an early scene you can clearly make out that melting man's eyeball fell out of his head so how did he manage to get around for the rest of the story i guess we're not supposed to ask br br at eighty four minutes this picture was about an hour and a half too long when it was all over i was ready to take up general perry on his earlier suggestion i could really use a drink about now
<START> this is not a good movie but i still like it the cat clovis is gold in a jar as well as the premise of the cats themselves intrinsically opposed to the evil sleepwalkers i think there is more to this movie than people realize basically it is very harsh but this brusqueness can sometimes be good it's got the corny lines the abrupt ending and a comedic element conveyed by the bumbling policemen br br did anyone find the incestuous element a bit disturbing ultimately this movie is casually and randomly acrimonious which is quite effective i liken it to psycho the relationship between the mother and son the changing of protagonists i think the abruptness works also this is not a movie that you want them to lengthen it only works if it's short br br i'm still not sure whether the director lacked depth or whether he did these things with purpose we know stephen king has ability yet i haven't even read his books only seen some of his movies br br anyway i liked it if you like harsh corny movies with 80's overtones just watch it but don't expect too much it really is so bad its good
<START> this series just gets worse and worse poorly written and just plain not funny the premise is excellent but the writer's inexperience shines through by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about and resorted to that patronizing smug oh silly you style acting that comes with a no laugh script they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say aren't we zany isn't this funny well no it's not actually gum disease is less painful no wonder with the exception of corner gas canadians generally avoid canadian tv come on cbc you're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent pull the plug on this amateurish mess
<START> its plain to see why the makers of scary movie found it so easy to spoof these 'teen slasher' movies they are so unbelievably formulaic and if valentine had been released a year or so earlier i'm sure they would have been spoofing this film too that's if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the screams i know what you did last summers and urban legends br br valentine offers nothing new to this genre except a better than usual ending which of course leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel as always a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women killing the main character's friends one by one in typically over the top style lots of t a on display no character development bad acting and overly elaborate bloodshed br br the thing i can't stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as 'who done its ' the thing is that they aren't because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked and tells the main character who's friends have now all been murdered usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway eg main character's mother's uncle's fishing partner kicked his friend's father's dog everybody still left alive throughout the film is a 'suspect' but they are more 'red herrings' than suspects as we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealed br br valentine followed this formula almost to the letter spoiler mini spoiler anyway in valentine the motive was not revealed but more left for you to think about given that the film didn't quite conclude in the typical 'teen slash' way the issue is only part resolved and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody will the killer want more or were the demons truly vanquished br br this still didn't make valentine a good film instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual which still doesn't count for much to anybody thinking of making another film along these lines please don't originality is so important and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre
<START> three daring daughters is a sickly sweet rose colored look at divorce remarriage and single parent living obviously social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted takes a cruise and then dates and marries a band conductor even when the its just a movie phrase excuses the script from addressing real life problems 'daughters' suffers from too many incoherent high note songs children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader hose iturbi playing himself isn't it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married br br admittedly this movie was released in the nineteen forties only a love for old style hollywood romance and comedy could make 'daughters' a tolerable film
<START> if edward woodward was the the flicks watching this film then that's what he would scream out in horror br br i'm sorry folks but enough's enough we had get carter the italian job alfie and now this what's the similarities no it's not exactly a coincidence that three of the originals star maurice micklewhite and the other stars another great british actor the main common ingredient in those originals is the britishness of the films they weren't made to impress hollywood they were quirky english films with a unique charm atmosphere that just cannot be replicated in the usa the word is cult and what better way to destroy a cult film than to bastardise it with a remake or even a sequel br br wicker 06 had a tough task before it even hit the road wicker 73 is even more enigmatic that other said cult films it defies genre intelligent scripts a grade actors the music score set pieces that defy description and all the stories surrounding the film br br so here comes a remake don't worry no originals were harmed in the making of this remake some major aspects of the story needed to be reworked for the modern usa communications paganism virgins but that's just about the whole premise so we give the cop a nam style trauma past complete with shock music flashbacks for the cheap scares then with no mobile phone mast on the island that sorts the communication out but in the real world this wouldn't happen cops just don't go missing give him a blood link for motivation rather than the clash of beliefs and you have the remake wafer thin though isn't it br br it's just that it was all laid on with a trowel the name alterations were simply hammy almost carry on there was no sense of community on the island no centre of town to catch your bearings just a few houses dotted about a forest and that was it willow was just annoying by not giving out any info at all and cage was useless to let her get away with it when he went into the well you just knew he would get locked it the screenplay was signposted all the way to the end and you just wanted it to hurry up and end the epilogue was absolutely hilarious and didn't know when to stop br br that ending is probably the best way to summarise the difference between the two one ends in the most beautiful sunset after the most horrific day the other ends with a post production explain it all to the thickies type conclusion br br i loved the original but went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to see the film i left thankful in the knowledge that this film will probably end up beneath a highway somewhere only this time mercifully forgotten forever
<START> spoilers if such a thing is possible as a rabid robin williams fan i felt it necessary to buy this film as first on screen appearance wow i could not imagine a more mind numbing movie essentially the movie takes one bad joke after another that your uncle artie would tell you after dinner and dramatizes them robin williams plays a lawyer in a 30 sec skit br br i'm all for bawdy humor but this humor wasn't pleasantly vulgar or ribald it was just mind numbing there are no redeeming qualities to this film other than robin williams fanatics like me who simply have to own every piece of film
<START> i notice that the previous reviewer who appears to be still at school gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn't seen the far superior 1989 bbc adaptation of this classic novel the major problem i had with this 1999 version was the casting of anthony way as tom long anthony way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini series the choir i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in the choir unfortunately the small boy who appeared in the choir had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time tom's midnight garden was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as schoolboy tom it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom as played by anthony would befriend the far younger hatty in the 1989 bbc version tom and hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable for a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 tv effects the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the 1989 bbc version fetches well over Â£20 00 second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under Â£5 00 need i say more
<START> greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman nina foch julia ross who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work julia reads an ad in the local london newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position julia obtains the position and is hired by a mrs hughes dame may witty who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job george macready ralph hughes is the son of mrs hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives this was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery this strange family all live in a huge mansion off the cornwall coast of england and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense
<START> men in black 2 was a real disappointment for me while the actors did a pretty good job especially smith there just isn't a cure for a poor script once in production the movie really had a sequel kind of feel playing off partial events of the first film the story was in a word bad at best it wasn't thought out well and seemed very choppy and incoherent at times br br in the first flick the mib organization had a kind of elite force feel you had a few special agents and it had a clandestine kind of feel to it in the sequel the mib organization has a jrotc summer camp vibe br br the movie wasn't terrible or anything it just lacked the coolness for lack of a better phrase of the first movie a lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second and didn't really add any originality to the mib universe br br a perfect analogy would be episode 1 to the first 3 films was it decent yeah is it worthy of bearing it's title not really
<START> peter sellers plays dick scratcher ha ha a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one although he's witnessed a treasure being buried he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank thus dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts do you place an ad for that and help lead a path to the treasure it's mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film former goon spike milligan replaced medak as director and given medak's talents in the film the ruling class you can probably guess which of the grainy poorly lit scenes had milligan in the director's chair peter boyle makes a brief appearance in the film's first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain he's probably quite thankful that young frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned so that he can keep this off his resume franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power behind scratcher but he and seller both look pretty desperate with even sellers' makeup and hair looking quite terrible they had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it with lines like these i can understand any possible unease br br pierre about to be hanged you'll pay for this br br scratcher no i won't i'll do it for free br br and that's one of the good jokes it's amazing to me that much of sellers prolific material is still in the vaults but this was made available on vhs more than 15 years ago how about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the us the well received british tv program a show called fred starring sellers milligan and directed by the great richard lester
<START> sorry this movie did not scare me it just annoyed me it was just so frustrating when i saw the potential and that all that fell by the wayside the children the father the premonition had so much potential and ziltch zero nada i have heard it all before scary no i can scare myself alone here where i sit than they could in the movie are there men writing that figure that women should be so annoying huh this movie was quite atmospheric or at least it could have been had the director writer bothered to work it we could have had some good music that would have added to the tension too if someone had made the effort what i really want to know is why do they get the money just give it to me and save all that hassle abandoned no we where betrayed
<START> when i went and saw this movie i had great expectations but i had so wrong this movie was exactly as every other horror movies it's a virus zombies etc exactly as resident evil and many many other movies but the difference with this and other movies is that the story is very week it's bad actors and boring music the photo is ok but the rest is total crap don't see this horror movie go and see the ring 2 or any other movie who's much more of a story i hope they will stop making horror movies who has a virus and the virus spread and make people to zombies we have seen enough of that the only good thing in the movie is when they are standing at a roof and shoot famous infected celebrities
<START> coyote ugly might have been much more effective if the film makers had made it an r rated guilty pleasure exploitation film with plenty of nudity but since the pg 13 rating is what all the studios are wanting these days we end up with a movie like this a pg 13 tease flick that isn't allowed to go nowhere near as far as the movie should have gone br br the script is go generic that it is easy to guess what plot point is going to occur 15 minutes before it actually happens the acting is adequate but the characters are so paper thin that nothing could be done with them there were also a lot of points where it seemed like i was watching a music video rather than a movie br br the film's only assets are the amazingly beautiful female leads we get to see them in some extremely tight and pretty revealing outfits but only so much could be shown due to the pg 13 constraints there's plenty of cleavage and toned heaving bodies doing some well choreographed dance numbers but there's no nudity or sex to speak of tyra banks she keeps getting even more insanely beautiful with age is also in the movie for a very small amount of time sexy newcomer piper perabo is also very easy on the eyes and she has a killer smile and shows some genuine acting potential br br the only people i could see this movie appealing to is pre pubescent boys who aren't allowed to watch r rated movies yet that audience might get a lot out of it from a titillation aspect but adult audiences will feel annoyed and cheated br br rating the movie 1 the women 10
