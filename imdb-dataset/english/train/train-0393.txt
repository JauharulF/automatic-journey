<START> i know sometimes its really really corny but the acting is amazing and melissa joan hart is as cute as a button i love this show a lot and i'm almost embarrassed that i do b c the show has a rep for being really corny but it makes me feel good my only problem is that sometimes it can be pretty low budget sometimes actors change and you just have to deal with it like sabrina's father is 2 different guys throughout the course of the movie i mean couldn't they just say he was an uncle or something still i can't help but loving this show harvey and sabrina make a really cute couple and salem is absolutely hilarious i definitely recommend it if your looking for some light and funny entertainment my favorite episode is pancake madness a hilarious episode the best season is probably 3 i'm not really a fan of some of the seventh season twists once you get to college morgan joins the group and her dialog is painful and very poorly acted plus she is ugly so the jokes about how she is only surviving off her good looks were lost on me but i think it was set up to have a really good eighth season and i was really sad to see one of my favorite shows canceled
<START> poorly cast terrible script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure you're in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life
<START> i rented this movie and watched it 20 times before i took it back to the store bill paxton hired some first rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists the story is original and well written powers booth and paxton both deliver good performances the story is told in an interesting manner with both flashbacks 20 years back then spots in the present alternating back and forth this style of storytelling makes for a good thriller that can't get dull bill paxton please make more horror movies you have the talent for it
<START> 1st watched 5 26 2002 4 out of 10 dir michael almereyda weird story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body at least i think that was the relationship a kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike stephen king's the shining the difference is that there was campiness in nicholson's performance that isn't at all in this film this is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame one liners and attempts at litening up the mood don't work at all the performances are not the problem here but the story is everything doesn't seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film there is a very small throwaway performance by christopher walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which of course gives him top billing in an attempt to sell the film don't buy into this gimmick and avoid this film br br
<START> i rented this movie today thinking it might be a good football movie since i'm a big football fan boy was i wrong this movie is way too religious and preachy and is really unrealistic this movie pretty much says that if your a christian you can get anything you want in life easily like become a great football player you don't become a great football player by becoming christian and asking god you do it through practice and hard work all you gotta do is ask god and he'll give you anything puh lease thats not true at all duh i laughed several times because of this embarrassment the only part that was funny was when they were being dumb shultz the cartoonist no the dude that flew over the atlantic etc etc but really this movie wasn't that great i don't recommend it especially if you aren't a christian lol
<START> yes i'm going with the 1 0 on this and here's why in the last few years i have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late fees because the movies were that easy to forget then i stumble upon nothing looked interesting wasn't expecting much though i was wrong this was probably one of the funniest movies i have ever had the chance to watch dave and andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember but not over complex to the point of missing the joke i don't want to remark on any of the actual scenes because i do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once with more and more pointless concepts coming into movies you know like killer military jets and fresh remakes that are ruining old classics this movie will make you happy to say it's ok to laugh at nothing
<START> when ben red foxx discovers his wife beatrice pearl bailey has run off with his own brother he rushes to his son norman michael warren to unload his tale of woe only to discover that norman has a secret lover the effeminate garson dennis dugan needless to say ben does not take it well and numerous complications follow including ben's attempt to get norman over being homosexual by fixing him up with a hooker tammy dobson unfortunately this description of the movie sounds a great deal more entertaining than the movie itself br br originally written for the theatre by ron clark and sam bobrick norman is that you was an absolute disaster on the new york stage to give the play its due i actually saw it staged in the 1970s as a community theatre production and while no one would accuse it of being anything other than a shallow farce the cast played so broadly and in such drop dead manner that it proved quite amusing it is a pity the cast of this film didn't do the same br br this is an atrociously performed motion picture red foxx one of the most hilarious comics of the 20th century is about as funny here as yesterday's wash michael warren who later appeared on the television series hill street blues to much better effect competes with foxx to see who can give the worst performance and pearl bailey is not far behind truth be told only dennis duggan tammy dobson and a cameo by wayland flowers have any spark and sadly that is only in comparison with the rest of the cast br br not only is the film badly performed it looks bad according to film lore this was the first big screen effort to be filmed in videotape which was then transfered to celluloid for project purposes and believe me it shows the film has the look of a bad 1970s sitcom right down to the painted skyline seen through the windows of norman and garson's apartment br br some films are so bad that they become funny but norman is that you isn't one of them i can sum up my reaction to this film in two words miss it don't buy it don't rent it don't touch it with a ten foot pole just back away slowly and then run like hell br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> a dedicated fan to the tlk movies with the first one being a milestone and the second probably the best sequel disney has produced along comes this film now i'm not arguing with animation voice work music but this is no more than a timon pumbaa screwloose in the tlk atmosphere although it isn't bad it doesn't add anything basically this movie is one big joke and that's about all that saves it make a real tlk3 disney the potential is there br br 4 10
<START> a delightful if somewhat predictable tv movie though i admit a little bias as far as i'm concered the more gene wilder in this world the better i'd love to see numerous additional movies detailing the adventures of larry cash carter
<START> my boyfriend and i rented this because we thought it might be a good 'halloween' take off a killer terrorizing young people a white mask you get my drift we were dead wrong no pun intended we not only discovered one of the worst movies out there but also that it is a cult classic it is filled w plot holes and makes no sense the actress who plays maddy is pretty but that's about it i do give credit for it being shot on a very low budget i always support movies like that just not this particular one br br this movie may be good to see if you're drunk or high otherwise don't bother unless you want to lose your movie privileges like i did
<START> i don't think anyone besides terrence malick and maybe tran anh hung makes cinema on a purer level than claire denis that said i don't love this her newest film quite as much as her 2001 masterpiece trouble every day although it comes very close which itself is one of my absolute favorite films it it only because the narrative here is possibly slightly too elliptical for it's own good don't get me wrong the fact that this film barely has a plot at all is really one of the best things about it but i think denis took it about one degree farther than it needed to go and consequently the film does flirt with incomprehensibility and a few key plot points should have been clarified somehow like that the main character goes to south korea to get his heart transplant instead of just showing him there all of a sudden without any explanation of where he is or why he is there also some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses for denis to use actors she likes yet again beatrice dalle's character in particular is a little distracting because you keep expecting that she is going to have some significance still the film is incredibly absorbing and the cinematography is beyond amazing it is definitely very much a masterpiece in it's own way at least as good as denis' more highly acclaimed beau travail if not better claire denis has to be my favorite french director at this point better than leos carax even also i have to admit that the south korean sequence really does do lost in translation better than that film itself does and i unlike some am a huge fan of that film as well
<START> this is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully acted by all players it will make you laugh and it will make you cry the very end of the movie gets me to mist up every time if you want to see a great movie this is it jimmy stewert supplies a wonderfully witty performance and frank morgan as mr matuschek is spellbinding morgan's diversity of character is nothing short of amazing william tracy as pepi is terrific comic relief and delivers some of the movies most important lines and performances felix bressart delivers a fantastic performance as perovitch a stumbling bumbling shop worker who's life's ambition is to please those he works with it is a simple story of how close co workers can become and how two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love though unusual circumstances
<START> i've known about bettie page for many a year now the soft core porn images of her from the 1950's have since become iconographic and still have a strong draw even today the bettie page look is also still hugely popular within the hetero fetish world and remains as distinctive today as it did then so i watched this film with quite a bit of familiarity to begin with the result did not disappoint br br among other things it was hugely entertaining to see the movie's recreation of actual figures like irving klaw john willie and bunny yeager Â all consider trailblazers today mary harron did an excellent job creating the desired ambiance of sexual repression and hypocrisy in 1950's america along with a sexuality that by today's standards was innocent in the extreme i particularly liked the use of monochrome versus color as a visual shorthand for the emotional and spiritual climate bettie found herself in br br i think that gretchen mol did an excellent job of presenting the character of bettie in all her innocent sexuality and all her utter naivetÃ© bettie loved to look pretty loved the attention saw nothing wrong with nudity and enjoyed dressing up in silly outfits for the camera the underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires all that evoked were completely lost on her to this day she still doesn't understand what all the fuss was about when it comes to her pictures or the s m content of them br br this isn't to say she's uneducated or too simple to understand it's just that she simply doesn't get it about fetishism and never will no harm there bettie page is simply being who she is the film captured this quite nicely br br the social atmosphere of the 1950's depicted by ms harron and written by her along with guinevere turner makes me truly glad i live in the day and age that i do the hypocrisy and repression combined with the massive ignorance about our sexuality all combined to a frighteningly stifling world the film well captures this and brings to cheering as bettie endures it all with her unshakeable faith and her unchangeable naivetÃ© br br this film was a bit slow at times but hit all the points ms harron attempted and hit them well i'd recommend this film even for those folks with little to no knowledge of who bettie page was and what effect she had on american culture for those with such interests then this film is a must see
<START> i don't know why some people criticise that show so much br br it is a great funny show probably not the right material for mainstream prime time but still br br the family dynamics are funny and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried roy jibes are only just above average but ever so often you have sub plots or one liners that make you roll on the floor laughing br br this show was well worth the 8 pounds i paid for it br br rating 8 10
<START> if i had not read pat barker's 'union street' before seeing this film i would have liked it unfortuntately this is not the case it is actually my kind of film it is well made and in no way do i want to say otherwise but as an adaptation it fails from every angle br br the harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern england working class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after i had finished i was put through tears repulsion shock anger sympathy and misery when reading about the women of union street excellent a novel that at times i felt i could not read any more of but i novel i simply couldn't put down depressing yes but utterly gripping br br the film oh dear hollywood took barker's truth and reality and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it a beautiful film an inspiring soundtrack excellent performances a tale of hope and romance yes an adaptation of 'union street' no br br the women of union street and their stories are condensed into fonda's character their stories are touched on but many are discarded i accept that some of barker's tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn't practical but the content is not my main issue the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost darkness and rain broken windows covered with cardboard and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine pretty houses and a twinkling william's score br br if you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of 'reality' i advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like 'schindler's list' but without the happy ending
<START> first off let me say that i am a great believer in fanpro stuff i see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been cancelled star trek voyages and star wars revelations are examples of decent efforts so i have a soft spot for fanpro stuff that means i'll overlook things that i would ordinarily slate badly br br so on to st hf well first off the good things enthusiasm is a major part of making any show believable and for the most part the crew of the various ships all seem to be having a good time with their roles next the effects aren't bad for a home brew effort with nothing to make you really wince the stories aren't too bad either nothing particularly innovative but solid enough stuff and at least there are ongoing story arcs br br but it has a lot of faults br br first off although they quite obviously have to rip off star trek footage set backdrops music and effects i see no reason why they proceeded to rip off virtually every other sci fi musical score ever made everything from aliens to starship troopers rears it orchestral head at one point or another likewise much of the footage is from other movies dutifully cgi'd over to make it look different the grey warships for instance though disguised are quite obviously star destroyers from star wars and the station is also rather obviously fleet battle station ticonderoga from starship troopers likewise sound effects from various star wars movies appear in space battles between fighters as does animated over footage in one scene in either first or second season i think you even see two tie fighters fly past during a battle which hardly does your suspension of disbelief any favours br br acting varies from the reasonable to the hideously painful to watch everyone does improve as the seasons progress though but expect to grimace at the screen a lot especially in the early seasons they've also made some interesting acting choices let's just say that the food replicators on this show seem permanently set to cake and leave it at that br br make up effects are generally quite effective on the whole but they really ought to mercilessly club to death the person who decided to use cheap ferengi and cardassian masks for anything other than background use or passing shots they are just beyond unrealistic every time i saw one of these apart from trying not to laugh too much i kept expecting the unfortunate soul wearing it to pull out a gun and announce that this is a stick up in one scene a cardassian actually talks whilst wearing one of these not only do the lips not move but the mask doesn't even have an opening where the mouth should be someone needs to be slapped hard for that couldn't they have taken a craft knife to it for goodness' sake there are also some well done but unintentionally funny make up jobs such as the herman munster look alike br br the writing though coherent is nothing new instead the script runs like a continuation of ds9 with the ships heading out from ds12 on various missions the new enemy the grey aren't very menacing and the plot line involving them is effectively a reworking of the borg threads i e starfleet meet the grey the grey are hugely powerful starfleet barely escape with their lives then through technology they begin to find ways to combat the enemy etc etc all done before with the borg br br another bone of contention is the dialogue star trek writers have long had the ability to write insert technobabble here into a script it usually means an exposition of the latest plan to combat the enemy using quantum phase discriminators or isolytic charges etc in other words nonsense that tells you that they are on the case and a resolution is at hand br br the words are just gibberish really i've no problem with this but where st hf makes a mess of it is where they include real world comments into this concept br br tactical advice such as we need to regroup sounds good but not when uttered by trio of characters already standing in a group likewise when asked what the situation is a tactical officer is heard to reply we count three battleships he actually needed to count them c'mon i expected the questioner to ask him are you sure or can you double check but my all time favourite comment is this br br captain can we establish two way communication br br comms officer no we can only send and receive br br well duh br br having said all the above the show does improve as it goes along seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad 3 shows an improvement but 4 5 are where it starts to get noticeably better season 6 so far looks quite reasonable br br i do have a problem with their choice of media for the shows though quicktime sucks quite frankly and the sooner they move to divx avi format the better some of us like to actually take our downloaded shows and watch them on decent size screen and not peer at a tiny qt window on a computer monitor not only does quicktime make this difficult but the 320x180 resolution the shows are in does not scale at all well in fact it makes the shows pretty unwatchable like they were a tenth generation vhs tape copy the least they could do was to include a hi res downloadable option br br anyway the show has promise and i'm even beginning to like some of the characters but that's 40 episodes on so i'm not sure this says that much about character development at all br br but what can you say it's free br br ps out of 28 votes 19 people rated this show as a 9 or 10 hmmmm were we watching the same show or are you 19 all three year olds
<START> taking over roles that jack albertson and sam levene played on broadway walter matthau and george burns play a couple of old time vaudeville comics a team in the tradition of joe smith and charles dale who seem to have a differing outlook on life br br walter matthau can't stop working the man has never learned to relax take some time and smell the roses he's a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent richard benjamin is finding less and less work for him br br what hurt him badly was that some 15 years earlier his partner george burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family a workaholic like matthau can't comprehend it and take burns's decision personally br br benjamin hits on a brain storm reunite the guys and do it on a national television special what happens here is pretty hilarious br br the sunshine boys is also a sad bittersweet story as well about old age matthau is on screen for most of the film but it's burns who got the kudos in the form of an oscar at the ripe old age of 79 br br burns brought a bit of the personal into this film as well as we all know he was the straight man of the wonderful comedy team of burns allen who the monty python troop borrowed a lot from in 1958 due to health reasons gracie allen retired and george kept going right up to the age of 100 or at least pretty close to as an active performer br br the sunshine boys is based on the team of smith dale however and if you like the sunshine boys i strongly recommend you see two tickets to broadway for a look at a pair of guys who were entertaining the american public at the turn of the last century the doctor sketch that matthau and burns do is directly from their material br br and i do think you will like the sunshine boys
<START> if at least the cruelty and drawn out deaths had a purpose to the story to justify their inclusion but the script was just unintelligible and just plain stupid br br it went nowhere the story had no legible continuity it was just a bunch of drawn out pointless snuff scenes and a really stupid ending tacked on as if to say the end beep you my haters and my few defenders for watching my garbage br br i don't get it a masked murderer who never had his mask removed in prison a prison rape scene that was suppose to be the guards raping a a ugly deformed serial killer and getting killed by him and nothing else no explanation no punishment a really weak main cop character that was a waste of a actor like pare who didn't try to off the guy who killed his cops tortured a baby a woman and a dog and sent them to you to watch on video br br cops who for some unknown reason all wandered off in the dark by themselves individually in his farm house at night like a bunch of poorly written teenage characters to be killed one at a time like a bunch of idiots and no other cop hears them die in the darkness one after the other and just keep wandering around for no reason till each is killed in turn br br a bunch of horrible real life animal snuff scenes in the beginning for no reason or explanation was he reminiscing was he watching it to masturbate was it comedy for him what was it nope boll just thought to throw it in to upset animal lovers whatever br br then pare believing the word of a psycho path to let his family go if he kills himself a more gullible stupider cop you never saw in a film br br i dunno why i try not to totally hate his works i try to find some reason to explain a horror writers art but this stuff pure crap br br boll what are you doing anymore i hope you figure it out because i know a lot of more deserving people who can't dream to get the budget you get over and over again to make their movies br br if you want to see boll actually at his best check out postal it was actually okay
