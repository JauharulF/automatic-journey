<START> possible spoiler br br you d think a story involving archie grey owl an englishman posing as a red indian would have a massive amount of humour involved in fact i d say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy however richard attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making grey owl a serious drama worse he s made an extremely dire film too pierce brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between grey owl and pony played by the equally wooden annie gaupeau lacks any type of on screen chemistry but to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he s a native american the producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of archie being an englishman that s why i wrote possible spoiler it s not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is english but it s obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there s absolutely no surprise involved br br yes i do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn t actually a new concept theodore roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told and it should also be remembered that with the exception of soylent green and possibly the two towers if you want to class it as having a green message that there hasn t actually been a great ecological film in fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes grey owl a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor
<START> like another reviewer said this movie is not a heavy melodrama but it deals with harsh realities a very very playful movie that does not dwell for a moment some very good acting and some wonderful smiles as well
<START> i paid one dollar for this dvd and at first i was feeling ripped off but then i started thinking about it and i should be grateful i have found a holy grail a real touchstone of bad cinema if you think the opening dramatic shots of an empty stadium successfully fizzle with evel's awkward camera address monologue then wait until the opening credits roll on the chauffeur's butt the script seems to be pasted together from press clippings and esl textbooks but i just can't believe how bad george hamilton is he seems to have absolutely no connection to anything he says the only internal monologue i can detect is gosh i bet they think i am cute really cute this is an epiphany i now know how bad it can get
<START> omg the only reason i'm giving this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because tom hanks is funny as an elvis in the box apart from that how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time there are no laughs to mention the stereotypes are pathetic the cast is wasted the direction is amateurish now that i think about it most of the blame probably lies with the director joel zwick he brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved don't waste your time like i did but then i enjoy a good train wreck geez now the system is telling me i need more lines here ya go this movie should be called return to sender okay now that was funnier than anything in the movie
<START> airport '77 starts as a brand new luxury 747 plane is loaded up with valuable paintings such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens james stewart who is flying them a bunch of vip's to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum also on board is stevens daughter julie kathleen quinlan her son the luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid air the plane is hi jacked by the co pilot chambers robert foxworth his two accomplice's banker monte markham wilson michael pataki who knock the passengers crew out with sleeping gas they plan to steal the valuable cargo land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent chambers almost hits an oil rig in the ocean loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the bermuda triangle with air in short supply water leaking in having flown over 200 miles off course the problems mount for the survivor's as they await help with time fast running out br br also known under the slightly different tile airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash hit disaster thriller airport 1970 was directed by jerry jameson while once again like it's predecessors i can't say airport '77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best just it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid air hi jacking then the crashing didn't he see the oil rig sinking of the 747 maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure 1972 submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened it's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character's dull dialogue lethargic set pieces a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks there's not as much urgency as i thought there should have been even when the navy become involved things don't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships helicopters flying about but there's just something lacking here george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background br br the home video theatrical version of airport '77 run 108 minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni flashbacks to flesh out character's longer rescue scenes the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport '77 as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions interior design choices i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren't great either along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie award's hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that's a little harsh the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately the pace is slow not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly br br the production values are alright if nothing spectacular the acting isn't great two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this one time oscar winner james stewart looks old frail also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too br br airport '77 is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly the production bland direction doesn't help though a film about a sunken plane just shouldn't be this boring or lethargic followed by the concorde airport '79 1979
<START> handsome guys with bad haircuts beautiful girls without any clues stupid gangsters who cannot shoot straight from dragon dynasty comes the hong kong gangster drama dragon heat for reasons which will probably forever be completely obscured the production and casting call for this 'criminals on steroids' movie somehow got both maggie q and michael biehn to sign on as villains but they don't get all that much to do in this horrid slug fest br br they are two of the best contemporary actors around each with their own resume' and list of accomplishments and biehn in particular has had the courage to take some rather challenging and non heroic roles br br maggie q was the super bad mai in live free or die hard so 'nuff said br br biehn is of course famous for being the soldier from the future who made the terminator of 1984 such a believable science fiction fantasy romp by crashing up against big arnold who is now the governator of california br br michael biehn is almost wholly wasted in this terrible train wreck of a police drama there is absolutely no reason for that as the incredibly convoluted plot given mostly in chinese as it is a hong kong story could have been better elaborated for non chinese audiences with a foreign narrator br br in other words if biehn had been used as something like an interpol observer or coordinator or an agent under deep cover who needs to get some 'splaining given to him every five or ten minutes that would have been great but no he's brought in as a part of an odd group of special forces type bad guys who seem to be freelancing their own corrupt deal in the middle of somebody else's totally corrupt deal involving the local king of corrupt deals br br yes there i said it all confused me too welcome to the party pal br br in the truly superb hong kong crime drama known by its english title as breaking news there are also a number of fascinating characters at work but there is only one story line in the plot br br bad guys vs good cops in this wretched and excessively violent foray into the world of a hong kong triad or gang it seems that the hot shot police force is little more than a parade of ducks in a shooting gallery the way the criminals mow them down br br so not surprisingly there's an almost otherwise incomprehensible scene several scenes in fact where kids are trying to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game to win stuffed animal prizes and so the hot shot good guy police officers quite naturally intervene on their behalf so that the arcade owner has to give up the kewpie dolls br br there's also a half hearted attempt at creating a love interest between one of the 'visiting cops' and the sole female 'visiting cop' br br the visiting cops are supposed to be material witnesses against the triad gangster leader who gets hijacked on the way to his court appearance but not by his own team but by the mercenaries biehn maggie q and some others these killers all want something but we don't get to learn about what it is until the very end of the film that was a stupid mistake inside of the overall story br br you cannot build suspense in a crime drama without something to obtain or get or get away from being introduced very early in the story br br add to that some cut away scenes done for purely artsy effects all showing the bad bad guys' and the regular bad guys' recent pasts and any film buff can readily understand why this barking dog gets a 1 rating from this fan of all things cinematic with criminals and conspirators and hong kong
<START> the premise of the story is simple an old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred though very little dialog is provided throughout the film the visual narrative told by the camera's eye alone made the film quite engaging the setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness which complements the quietness of the characters themselves we can also sense helplessness in the old man's inability to convince the police of the murder which parallels the silenced child's inability to tell her own story br br true horror lies in feelings of hopelessness helplessness and irrationality this film successfully addresses these elements by visuals alone rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weak br br cleverly the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a few creepy and startling moments the ending is also unexpected and believable reminiscent of japanese horror films such as the ring and dark water or english horror films such as lady in black and the innocents this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror i recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare to give this film a try br br by the way if you haven't seen the films i just mentioned above you might want to give them a try as well
<START> madhur bhandarkar has given it all raw but the best part is he hasn't forgotten to give the ingredients it has come short and crisp to the viewer and it is the audience to make the choice now page 3 is a revelation of the naked truth irrespective of the crudeness attached to it br br madhavi konkan sharma is a journalist and enjoys her work a simple and peaceful life adores her with a caring boyfriend and a nice roommate pearl she covers the page 3 celebrity page of nation today where she has a very supportive editor deepak suri boman irani but life takes turn for her as she hits the first bump and takes herself away from page 3 and goes into crime bit omigosh a whole new world was waiting for her there she is shocked excited stunned with the revelation her reaction has resulted in losing the job at the end she is back to page 3 now when she meets any celebrity in a party she knows the actual looks of each hidden under the illusive face br br the movie has a message and it is crude the audience needs to get it in their own color the theme and the screenplay was fantastic there are some very good thoughts applied to prepare the audiences like the foreplay club is shown before the pedophiliac exhibition the short suspense before gay actions in bathroom the dialogs are strong and the actors are really good at delivering it charu mohanty's 2 words speaks volumes and he is very successful in uttering those two words with such ingenuity it leaves an impact the set selections could have been better the songs don't stand anywhere but they were needed in the background atul kulkarni has a small role with high impact there were a few flaws visible atul kulkarni explaining konkan sharma that honesty should be tagged along with intelligence there could have been a better dialog as this sounds like a preach the meeting between thapar and his daughter doesn't call for acting that scene looks very unprofessional br br overall it is a must watch movie with selective options before the pedophilia incident that may spoil your mood
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br marshall lawson steven seagal is assigned to france on a reconaissance mission along with three new young strike team recruits after disobeying a direct order from above however the night before they're due to strike they are all found grusomely slaughtered by a killer with seemingly inhuman strength with the french police dallying around with their own investigation he goes in search of those responsible himself only to uncover a corrupt faction of the military dealing in a deadly new drug that alters a person's dna and gives them terrifying new strength br br bad cover bad title bad post production tampering and bad trailer pretty bad film but i've got to say i don't think attack force is quite his worst i know this will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here perhaps not steveday but i think a lot of the criticism has stemmed from all the bad news that went before the film rather than the actual quality of it itself br br i must say there was nowhere near as much dubbing or ropey editing as i'd been lead to believe the dubbing there was which made him sound like martin sheen with a groin problem was pretty awful and quite frequent but not in use for as large a segment of the film as i'd thought the plot flowed pretty smoothly as well considering all the messing about with the original finished film called harvester that went on also as another reviewer noted the film has a nice gothic look to it a new touch for a seagal film br br the absolute killer low point though was the complete and total lack of any exciting action with only a few poorly filmed fight scenes for any fun br br i have to be honest though i would rather watch this again than flight of fury today you die or out for a kill
<START> picture bride has an excellent look into hawaii's past and the people who lived there in that time the time money earned and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live takes a whole new meaning to blood sweat and tears br br the concept of dating matchmaking is something like what we do similar today via the net just that is more of snail mail very slow snail mail br br the singing of the plantation's songs from the workers reminds me of the southern plantation workers' songs of their demise and future goals br br the movie shows the hardship as well as soft romantic scenes that hawaii can bring like the stillness of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility
<START> new york 1953 one hot night four famous iconic figures will come together the professor albert einstein has come to ny to give a speech which he has the senator joesph maccarthy on his back later that night his gets a surprise visitor a famous actress marilyn monroe who actually wants to discuss the theories of relativity soon her ball playing husband joe dimaggio turns up at the hotel room begging to work things out for their crumbling relationship flashbacks of childhood important events perceived consequences of their actions creep in to show how these individuals cope with despair and a hidden fear waiting to break out br br now that's one of a kind adapted off a stage play by terry johnson who would also script the screenplay for the film insignificance is an odd quirky seductive and downright curious fictional pop culture gimmick in the hands of director nicolas roeg this inspired and cerebral experimental effort might be rooted in its stage play origins because it does feel theatrical and most of the action occurs in a hotel backdrop and one main suite the cramp look only enhanced the moody and smoky atmosphere of new york to great effect however these limitations can't contain the fruitful and daring ideas that roeg manages to randomly storm up visually and through the meaningful material the way he reflects on the characters' who are suggestively famous figures without the need of naming of them philosophical journeys and interpretations of their notions is stimulating in a spiritual sense with the memories gelling into the present and visions showing their fears of realisations which depending on what you're seeing is either beautiful or hauntingly implemented there's plenty of food for thought and hints within the verbosely innovative if sometimes awkward script with the main focus concerning the present situation but the flashbacks gives us the personal make up sex power enlightenment and glory of what makes them who they are and how much of a burden it can be in there already demanding lives sure the story might not lead to anything by the end and it can feel disjointed but the dreamy vibe and intelligent arrangement irons out those folds and makes sure it never turns giddy peter hannan's sensually fluid photography and stanley myers' titillatingly oozing blues soundtrack fit in snugly with roeg's stylistically subdue and established style of directing he makes it look like he's working with something big and large scale but otherwise that's not the case and a small little universe is created the vintage costumes and locations of the period all come off fittingly enough what made the film for me had to be the impressive acting it boasted from the main four theresa russell's perky drop dead gorgeous appeal of the sexy pin up actress is a growing portrayal that definitely held the film together along with an genuinely excellent and endearing performance by michael emil as the professor tony curtis marvellously plays it up as witch hunting senator and gary busey is suitably good in the stoically gravel manner as the ballplayer showing up in minor but amusing support roles happen to be will sampson and patrick kilpatrick br br a memorably striking fresh and tour de force meditation piece of metaphysics linked together by four different extremes some might find it pretentiously estrange and too talky but this one had me wrapped up in its own little unique world to worry too much about its shortcomings
<START> this film reminded me of the sopranos and not in a good way br br david chase's seminal mob opera only ever put its foot wrong twice the most jarring and inexplicable instance of which took place in its fourth season when junior soprano went on trial for his life rather than pursue this riveting and pivotal plot line the writers instead chose to completely ignore it focusing instead on bobby baccalieri's constant whimpering over his recently deceased wife's frozen pasta dish br br when something of genuine interest happens in notorious for example that first mysterious assassination attempt on tupac shakur that ignited the whole east coast west coast feud in the first place and ended up leading to the deaths of both tupac and christopher wallace the film treats it as just another bit of plot to plod through why exactly was tupac so convinced that he was sold out by his own people did he alone nurture his subsequent affiliation with suge knight and was lil' kim's transformation from prim office drone into sex obsessed vampish diva really as banal as it appears here br br none of these questions are even fleetingly addressed by the film's screenwriters who are far more interested in depicting wallace's turbulent love life to zero compelling dramatic avail these sequences including a brain frazzlingly clichÃ©d groupie indescretion in a hotel room are so toothless and bruisingly manipulative that the only real comparison to be made is with a network tv movie br br the storytelling in both structure and content is simplistic and trite but more fundamentally as a biopic as something designed to celebrate its subject and educate the uninitiated on the intricacies of their life and work the film is almost entirely worthless the reliance on meat and potatoes genre plotting coupled with the lifeless musical performances an area in which a film like this should soar surely result in a film that appears to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved leaving wallace's questionable status as a giant in his field as the preserve of the easily persuaded and previously converted only br br and the final twenty minutes in which wallace's posthumous cultural identity is broadly painted as being akin to that of a latter day saint quite frankly made me feel like throwing up br br on that score much as with any other notorious is crass calculating and compromised
<START> like the jeffersons good times was one of the those classic american sitcoms which was never aired in the uk not to mention it came out in the 1970s a decade where of which i wasn't born yet br br but like most fans of the show i watched a few episodes on you tube and afterwards i loved it br br the evans family are headed by james and florida two parents trying to make ends meet and who despite their lack of qualifications encourage their children who have their own aspirations in life to fulfil them and to take their chances james was the strict but loving dad who didn't dare hesitate in disciplining j j michael and thelma should they over step the line whilst florida in contrast was a fair kind hearted and considerate mother and loving wife although she was in many ways similar to james with regards to their attitudes to parenthood and family values from an afro american perspective br br the kids were just as lively and entertaining as the parents themselves j j was an aspiring artist with a goofy personality and crazy sense of humour who would often wear multi coloured outfits and whose 'dy no mite' catchphrase is as infectious and familiar as arnold jackson's 'whatchoo talking' 'bout willis ' from diff'rent strokes michael was the smart alec who dreams of becoming a lawyer whilst sister thelma had her own dreams and hopes her verbal taunts with j j were mostly hilarious as was the love hate relationship between brother and sister which was played out extremely well by both mike evans and bernadette stanis br br over the seasons there were a few cameo appearances made most notably from janet jackson debbie allen and a young gary coleman as himself i actually prefer good times over say the cosby show which was an 80s show because a i preferred the evans family over the huxtables both in terms of a characterisation and b as i felt it tackled serious and difficult social issues in a way that resonated with many viewers it was a comedy but it was also a social commentary which aimed to highlight the lives of working class afro americans in 1970s america the cosby show attempted to cater to the mainstream audience in a 'candy coated' way as the huxtables were portrayed as blacks who easily assimilated themselves into an upper class u s culture we would associate whites with whereas good times in contrast was much more 'edgier' and it was not afraid to address themes such as drug and child abuse in a realistic way i actually found that whilst the cosby show can be fun to watch at times it lacked that bit of 'sassiness' which good times has and of which made it trendier and cooler br br the show did jump the shark during the latter seasons as it continued after john amos's character james died in a freak accident in reality it was known at the time that john had quit good times for good and so his character's death was written as it is on the show without john the show suffered and alas it lost a lot of its charm br br still for a sitcom good times ticked all the right boxes if only they had shown this in the uk during the 80s as it certainly is as jj would put it 'dy no mite ' br br my rating 8 and a half
<START> how can barry levinson possibly assemble white hot comedy talents ben stiller and jack black the gorgeous rachel weisz old pro christopher walken and still deliver such a humourless stinker br br stiller and black are friends until the latter invents a spray to make dog mess vanish and becomes a conspicuous consuming multi millionaire br br the premises is thin but sound enough in the right hands to have been a springboard for some great bitching between the two stars but all concerned overplay every hand every chance they can br br stiller and black are simply not funny for way too much of the time weisz looks sensational as always but is criminally underused and with the exception of walken as a batty barfly who urges stiller's character to take revenge it's a turgid trudge to the end of this strained farce
<START> i'll give this movie two stars because it teems with beautiful photography otherwise it teems mainly with clichÃ©s and stereotypes mountain people are either dumb white trash of the fanatically religious or ragged racist kind or wise white indians indians are magical people who move around without a sound can disappear in the blink of an eye talk to animals and read minds over large distances and so on and so forth br br throughout the movie i kept wondering what the point of the film was other than showing me pretty pictures of mountains log cabins woods an assortment of animals free spirited mountain dwellers and freaky people in church br br the plot touched a whole range of issues but explored none of them in depth this was neither a story about growing up during the depression nor about about being an orphan nor about a struggle for identity it tried to be all of those things and more which made it superficial and unsatisfactory br br although the movie was supposed to be about little tree's education we learn almost nothing about it he was given a brief summary of the history of his people who were brave and stoic and a distillery demonstration tried his hand at chopping wood at which he failed and whiskey running literally learned how to read and maybe to write with the help of grandma and her dictionary and that was it apparently he didn't learn much during his stint in boarding school because he was locked up in the attic br br however grandma and grandpa and graham greene's character made sure that in the end little tree became a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult after and i'm paraphrasing here riding with the navajos and getting caught up in a couple of wars was to catch up with grandma and grandpa and graham greene's character in heaven instead of say dating girls getting married having children or other such nonsense br br last but not least i must say that i found grandpa's trade offensive why of all things did it have to be a whiskey still to counteract the stereotype of the drunken indian
<START> it seems hal hartley's films are kind of hit or miss with most audiences this film will be no exception to that rule fay grim acts as a sequel to hartley's 'henry foole' from 1998 the focus this time is on henry's ex wife played to perfection by the always welcome parker posey who is being pestered by cia goons about henry's unpublished book about all of his shady dealings in the interim of all of this fay ends up on an odyssey dealing with international spies etc the film does get a bit bogged down in the second half if you've been a fan of hal hartley in the past this is one not to be missed for the novice hartley first timer who has only heard of his film making technique you might want to check out his earlier films before taking on this one especially if you haven't seen 'henry' yet i admired the camera work which at times reminded me of certain early man ray photography
<START> since the advent of literature people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love even more fascinating have always been the tales of impossible love love that cannot be the israeli filmmaker eytan fox' latest film Âthe bubble is about that and then it is also not the title of the film refers to the Âbubble that is tel aviv set against the background of the political realities of israel the country's cosmopolitan and unofficial capital city doesn't have much in common with nablus a city in the palestinian west bank which also features in the film it doesn't have much in common with the tense and hateful atmosphere at the palestinian checkpoints actually it doesn't seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it the Âbubble of tel aviv allows people to have a lifestyle which isn't much different from what you may expect in any western city teenage girls looking for britney spears' records a lifestyle magazine editor looking for a sexy cover for his next issue trendy people sitting in trendy cafes discussing trendy things over cups of cappuccino and other similarly trendy drinks while those at home are watching the local edition of pop idol it is this Âbubble that also has the potential to lull one's mind into a false sense of reality br br the film evolves around the lives of three young israelis who share a flat and for the most part try to stay out of politics yelli the camp owner and manager of Âorna ella a hip cafe rarely leaves the city and prefers not to think about the Âcrap that surrounds them noam a soft and easygoing employee of a slightly avantguard record store seems to be equally unwilling to engage in long political discussions and contemplations lulu the only female of the lot is on the contrary linked to the israeli left although her political activities seem to be confined to Âraves against the occupation yelli and noam naturally don't object to participating in these lulu and her political friends make t shirts with the rave's logo put up posters and hand out booklets advertising it in the neighbourhood their main concern seems to be that there are never any actual palestinians participating and that the police might come and spoil all the fun for them again the closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a scuffle with some not so palestinian friendly locals who try to prevent them from handing out the leaflets in other words predictable products of the Âbubble br br the opening scenes of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to nablus where we also find noam doing his reserve duty a group of palestinians is being thoroughly checked before entering israel among them a pregnant woman who suddenly goes into labour and gives birth to a stillborn child despite the best efforts from noam and the doctor who eventually arrives in an ambulance the woman is comforted by a young man who later turns up on noam's doorstep in tel aviv with his id which the latter obviously dropped during the ordeal on the border his name is ashraf he's palestinian and he's gay and he hasn't just come to hand back the id he has come to see noam without a permit to live in israel and despite the initial hesitation from noam's flatmates he stays he soon gets a jewish name and a job at yelli's cafe having grown up in jerusalem with hebrew he doesn't have an arabic accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to conceal his identity the sky is light blue and the air is sweet but it cannot last for he has become part of an equation which was never meant to be br br at one point noam and ashraf watch a play called bent about two prisoners in a nazi concentration camp who have a love relationship which can never become physical or visible to the surrounding guards they find a way of being together on another level a metaphysical one a level where no one else has access this is also where our couple arrives in the end and it couldn't have been much different for them not in today's israel br br Âthe bubble is a political statement about the bubble that bursts when confronted with the political realities of today's israel set against the background of a beautiful and awkward love story involving an israeli and a palestinian the impossible love story in a divided world where no such things as compromise or other colours than black and white exist Âthe bubble is also a beautiful film about people gay and straight inhabiting that strange city tel aviv shown through the eyes of people who really care about them the film's premise may have its flaws and the fatal chain of events may seem somewhat construed but its strong message and emotional impact will not leave you untouched
<START> when i saw that this movie was being shown on tv i was really looking forward to it i grew up in the 1980's and like everyone else who has grown up in that era have seen every 80's teen and summer camp movie out there so i couldn't wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre what a disappointment the movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over with hardly any plot and no substance and the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed some of these so called jokes didn't come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive the only good things about this film were the wardrobe music and acting it was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80's and the same goes for the music and the acting was top notch throughout almost all of hollywood's best comedians were present too bad they didn't have better material to work with
<START> my complaints here concern the movie's pacing and the material at hand while using archival film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting perspective too often the material selected to highlight simply isn't very interesting such as when goebbels complains about this or that ailment tc or the ad nauseam footage of his small german hometown also the movie crawls along in covering c 1920 1939 and then steams through the war years in sum the film is little better than a history channel documentary with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average history channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details of goebbels' life still i found it wanting
<START> i really liked this movie because i have a husband just like the guy in this movie this movie is about lindsey who meets ben in the middle of winter when baseball season isn't in she falls in love but when spring comes along she gets the shock of her life when she is placed one step lower on her pedestal that ben has put her on br br it's a funny movie with all of the baseball obsession that ben has he can't part from what he loves the most that's what makes it so funny and why so many women can relate to lindsey in real life also the people he sits with at the baseball games are just as obsessed as he is br br it's a funny movie and you won't strike out if you rent this one
