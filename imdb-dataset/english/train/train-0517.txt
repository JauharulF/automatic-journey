<START> i just saw this movie tonight opening night it was great i'm a big fan of sports movies and this was right up there as one of my favorites dennis quaid was great oh by the way mr quaid if you read this my sister lives in austin where you live and she was supposed to buy you a drink once well she kinda stood you up but she didn't mean to c not that anyone's going to believe that anyway it's a great movie everyone who likes a good sports movie should go out and see it c
<START> i just saw this movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations to begin with was still disappointed the most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point the guy being awake during the surgery had nothing to do with the outcome it would have ended the same way regardless so what was the point of this who knows also this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and he didn't think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table give me a break jessica alba is completely talentless and christiansen is almost as bad the whole thing was just laughable from start to finish i'm fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel you would be in more pain than that
<START> as others have said no luciano is a more apt title or response to this movie title for entertainment the great opera singer should stick to singing not that he's a terrible actor it's just that this movie stinks br br the first 25 minutes were fine a nice family movie as it were but after that it's nothing but a boring soap opera br br appropriately playing a singer pavarotti as giorgio fini loses his voice a few times and the doctor pamela taylor kathryn harrold comes to the rescue the singer then falls for the doctor the doctor slowly falls for the singer the two argue all the time and on and on and on it goes br br pavarotti has a winning smile and is a likable guy it's harrold that spoils things and after watching her here i am not surprised she didn't become a star br br there is nice scenery in the movie to enjoy good shots of san francisco and italy at least in the first half of the film i got bored and don't remember much about the second half of it
<START> oh god i must have seen this when i was only 11 or twelve don't ask how i may have been young but i wasn't stupid anyone could see that this is a bad movie nasty gross unscary and very silly i've seen more impressive effects at disneyland i've seen better performances at a school play and i've seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo where they do nothing but sit in the water ignoring the children tapping on the glass br br the story is set in northern australia a handful of ambitious young people are trying out a new water sport surfing in shark filled waters it soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water after they learn what they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family br br i think i have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years the best of which is lake placid and the worse of which is its sequel blood surf would have to be the second worst croc flick i think with primeval and crocodile tailing closely behind br br the australian saltwater crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year movies like blood surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature but a good hour and a half of the viewer's life unless you really want to see it avoid blood surf
<START> really when it comes down to it this movie is just not funny josh kornbluth is the antithesis of funny and yet he thinks he's hilarious the plot about mailing the 17 letters was fine at first until josh's look at me i'm wacky approach began infesting each and every scene the judas priest joke may have been the least funny thing i have ever been privy to and that is saying quite a bit since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie and as for the incredible overuse of the pixies' debaser i have just one thing to say what did the pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this what did anyone do to josh kornbluth to cause him to write direct produce star in such a terrible movie
<START> a retired diplomat played nicely by michael york goes to russia to get revenge on the russian gangster that murdered the diplomat's policeman son there the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent russian cop who helps him bring the russian gangster to justice br br i remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous u s government it's interesting to see this time the russian guy as a hero br br not a great flick it's really typically a b action flick michael york lends some class to this mediocre movie alexander nevsky who plays the russian cop is kind of blah but surprisingly has some chemistry with michael york face it michael york is such a good actor that he'd have chemistry with anyone he's doing a scene with disappointingly the handsome adrian paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie now if adrian paul was in this movie longer it would've been an above average b action flick all i can say about adrian paul is that he is real nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie the villain played by richard tyson is your typical bad guy he's very blonde and very villainous in this movie br br rent this flick if there is nothing else on tv to watch it's okay it doesn't suck too bad the action scenes are decent the acting could be better the plot could've moved much faster but hey you get to see what russia looks like today
<START> forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a decade however certain elements relating to how this wide screen entertainment was aimed at a mid fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit and the film's sometimes sluggish pacing doesn't help but the story's compelling central idea involving the ancient extinct krell civilization and monsters from the id hasn't lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant must see movie what i'm mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible the movie has never really looked that good on home video and it's elements are in dire need of restoration i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic
<START> i previously thought that this film was the lamest of the muppet films i would like now to retract that statement in my opinion now the lamest muppet film was the tv movie it's a very merry muppet christmas am it's a wonderful life rip off that was truly dreadful muppets take manhattan is nothing special but miles more enjoyable than merry muppet christmas br br the best songs are that 'you can't take no for an answer' song the one the muppet babies sing and the songs for the big finale itself as i loved the muppet babies tv show i loved the muppet babies sequence here i'm told that it was what inspired the muppet babies show br br the manhattan melodies show itself was the real showstopper with muppets from sesame street even appearing for the wedding as kermit puts it in his final line 'what better way could anything end ' but i wish that what was between the beginning and end was a bit more entertaining there are cute cameos from brooke shields and gregory hines and a great dance sequence from rizzo and the rats choreographed by the late great jim henson himself and the film certainly entertains i must state though that muppet movie great muppet caper and muppet christmas carol are the three defininitive muppet movies
<START> of all the movies of the seventies none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the sentinel i mean yes there were movies like the exorcist and other ones but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one if you have time check this one out you may not be able to get past the dated devices as such but this is a story worth getting into then there are all the stars and soon to be stars my absolute favorites were eli wallach sylvia miles and burgess meredith then there are the subtle clues that lead to what's going on too pay close attention i had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like 'black and white cat black and white cake' plus the books are really good as well i'm just sorry that they're not going to turn the second book into a film it's so scary that it would outdo this movie
<START> pedantic overlong fabrication which attempts to chronicle the birth of the federal bureau of investigations begins quite promisingly with a still relevant probe into an airplane explosion however the melodrama involving james stewart and wife vera miles just gets in the way miles had a habit of playing tepid wives under duress and her frayed nerves arrive here right on schedule esteemed director mervyn leroy helmed this adaptation of don whitehead's book but despite the talent involved the picture fails to make much of an impression best performance is turned in by murray hamilton as stewart's partner however most of the dialogue is ludicrous and the dogged pacing causes the movie to seem twice as long as it is 1 2 from
<START> casting aside many of the favorable comments that have obviously come from friends and or relatives that pepper this and many other low budget independents listed on imdb one is lost when it comes to using these reviews as an accurate gauge so eventually you have to go out and rent the flick just to see for yourself one of the first things you must understand are the catch phrases that camouflage the reality of the movie in this case the term dark psychological thriller read hack writer director who thinks he's an auteur who replaces plot story and action with what he believes is a deep insight into the human soul his great insight festering and repressed childhood traumas emerge to wreck havoc when we become adults wow i bet freud would be really impressed too many would be film makers like kallio who were raised on low budget horror flicks of the last few decades fail to dig their own fresh grave instead they fall into the pre dug graves of the many other directors that came before them they are content with rehashing old and tired horror clichÃ©s that they borrowed from a dozen or more films the result is an unoriginal uninspired unbelievable waste of film stock

<START> i agree with many of the negative reviews posted here for reasons i will go into later on but this miniseries is powerful and convincing because the talented cast really captures the dark truth of hitler's world br br peter stormare is perfect as ernst rohm the brutal brownshirt leader each scene he has with hitler is explosive hitler is so evil he dominates everyone but the thuggish primitive rohm and he clearly digs rohm for just that reason the interplay between stormare and carlisle illuminates the way hitler relished rohm's brutality but later sacrificed him for political reasons br br jena malone turns in a heartrending performance as geli raubal hitler's doomed niece and the victim of his unspeakable perversions without revealing any of the sexual filth directly jena malone plays out all the horror of the slow extinction of a young girl's spirit she uses her eyes and voice to suggest all the horror that will be visited on millions in the years to come and she's brilliant zoe telford very nearly matches jena malone with her portrayal of eva braun eva is clearly sick cruel and heartless but at the same time almost pitiably dependent on her adolph's twisted tenderness the aborted lovemaking scene between them hinting at the spine tingling truth of hitler's enormous self loathing is both chilling and erotic br br liev schrieber gives a deliciously weasel like performance as putzi hanfstaengel the spineless man about town who is seduced by hitler's promises of wealth and power while a brute like rohm simply loves the idea of crushing skulls under his boots schrieber's character is one of many germans who abhors nazi violence but can't resist the quick and easy route to money and power his weak willed fawning over hitler soon loses him the respect of his wife played with style and sensuality by the stunning and regal julianna margulies they provide a true portrait of marriage and betrayal br br these performances carry the mini series along easily overcoming occasional weaknesses in the script there is one exception regrettably matthew modine's acting chops just aren't up to snuff his noble lunk haid journalist ruins every scene he has the viewer can hardly wait for rohm's brown shirts to stomp that smug righteous look off his ignorant corn pone low rent hollywood golden boy face but the story still works br br now in regard to the factual inaccuracies of the script hitler's perversions and cruelty are rendered in a vibrant compelling drama but the battlefield record of corporal hitler is badly distorted as if afraid the audience can't handle the idea of evil and courage in the same person the writers make hitler look like a whining coward who begged for an iron cross as if anyone in the kaiser's army could get a medal just by whining about it the movie makes it look as if hitler were a coward in the trenches when he was a fearless soldier they also suggest his comrades despised him when in reality he was widely admired by officers and enlisted men alike the depressing thing is that the mini series succeeds so well in representing hitler as a monster in honest ways but they just couldn't resist the cheap shot br br all in all however hitler rise of evil is a soaring success highlighted by powerful performances
<START> there are moments in this unique cartoon of pure beauty but overall it's not very good limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal the character design looks like a cross between the original star wars clone wars and disney's kim possible brendan the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to ron stoppable in kim possible background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark yet by today's standards overall it is still poor and cheap looking many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern european or nordic animation from the mid 80's nice in its own way but for modern child audiences used to cg slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind is sure to disappoint the story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors aren't overly impressive noticeably the usually brilliant brendan gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part there are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly clichÃ© and stereotypically racist however some of the characters are good the viking villains although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound there is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by wolves from a viking attack that is very nicely put together the look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film watership down including a blatant rip off homage to the ghost rabbit of inlay the look is also clearly and obviously inspired by gaelic celtic anglo saxon art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look the film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner including a pretty match cut and a large scale viking attack that is very moody and impressive best of all though is the music much of the background music is melodic and moving specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers if the whole film was as poetic as this moment and it tries then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not reach a wide audience but instead it isn't a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and doesn't stand up to modern animation standards overall a film that clearly split my opinion in many ways but all together not great but worth watching for the music and song and the occasional pretty or scary moment oh yeah and the cat seemed to live for a long time not sure how that was possible
<START> my mother worked with dennis l raider for eleven years not to mention shared an office with him when it was announced he was btk she was shocked the whole day was just her telling stories about how she never would have seen him as the wichita killer i've heard her re tell them many times i've inquired her about a lot of things and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to i've read the entire book written about raider wichita is my hometown and i was surprised that such a thing could happen in kansas br br there was another btk movie on tv not too long ago and i thought this one would have been better at portraying dennis' killings maybe even have some intelligent touches to his motives br br i'm going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie this is based on my mom's portrayal of him all my readings on him and the video tapes i've seen of him talking br br first of all the camera angles were horrible it looked as though it had been shot on a home video camera the acting was terrible and i couldn't even bear to watch it br br dennis raider never had long hair dennis raider was a very anal man and was a follow the rule book kind of guy he wasn't as nice as the movie made him look he was very polite and abrupt business like same goes for his killings as far as we all know if you've seen his confession in court you can already guess br br and as for the obsession with the slaughter house no never have i read or has dennis raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or people squishing bugs in fact he practiced on cats and dogs for choking methods yet through out the whole movie he was putting animals in his victim's faces and acting like he cared about the well being of them br br dennis raider never killed the people that he knew he confessed this but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her also br br i really don't even want to go in to this movie and i'm already ranting this is not what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happenings of btk this is not what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie if you want a badly shot half porno with some slaughter scenes served the side then this is your kind of movie
<START> i've read most of the comments here i came to the conclusion that almost everybody agrees that 9 11 is a shocking piece of history there are a few who think that the added narrative is weak and br br i agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary about two brothers finding each other back after the disaster and the cliff hanger about tony but i don't think narration is unnecessary like i lot of theorists i think that our own lives are narrations we are living and making our own autobiography so if we tell about our lives this is always in the form of narration we don't sum up facts like birth childhood high school etc we create a story about our live br br because we are familiar with stories we want to put history in a story as well because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves we can better understand the things happened in history when its told in the form of a story so that's the purpose of adding a story in documentary the story is weak so be it but we understand whats going on if it was me out there i would be worried sick about my brother br br and the second point making a blockbuster movie about it true it's been to recent to come up with a big movie about 9 11 though there have been a few about the subject but none of them like this documentary but what if there will be a movie in about 5 years i agree it is wrong trying to make a lot of money out of 9 11 but i also agree that movies are one of the best way to tell history how many movies about the world war 2 have we seen if i had not seen these movies my view of the ww would me totally different i remember seeing schindlers list and i cried for an hour during class movies give you a good image of the things that happened in history and although it is fiction it contributes to the memory of the disasters and the casualties br br so my point telling stories is not always bad it makes us identify with the story and makes us never forget what happened
<START> no nonsense inspector hollaway a solid turn by john bennett investigates the disappearance of a famous thespian and uncovers the wicked past history of a creepy old house first and most mundane tale method for murder successful author charles hillyer nicely played by denholm elliott is haunted by images of the murderous fiend he's writing about in his latest book although this particular outing is too obvious and predictable to be anything special it does nonetheless build to a real dilly of a genuine surprise ending second and most poignant anecdote waxworks lonely philip grayson the always outstanding peter cushing and his equally lonesome friend neville rogers the splendid joss ackland both become infatuated with the beguiling wax statue of a beautiful but lethal murderess third and most chilling vignette sweets to the sweet quiet reserved and secretive widower john reid a typically terrific christopher lee in a rare semi sympathetic role hires nanny ann norton the fine nyree dawn porter to take care of his seemingly cute and harmless daughter jane a remarkably spooky and unnerving performance by the adorable chloe franks this stand out scary episode is given a substantial disturbing boost by the exceptional acting from gifted child actress franks who projects a truly unsettling sense of serene evil lurking just underneath a deceptively sweet and innocent angelic veneer fourth and most amusing yarn the cloak pompous horror movie star paul henderson delightfully essayed to the haughty hilt by jon pertwee purchases a mysterious cloak that causes him to transform into a vampire whenever he wears it this item makes for good silly fun and further benefits from the awesomely pulchritudinous presence of the luscious ingrid pitt as enticing vampiress carla director peter duffell working from a deliciously macabre and witty script by noted horror scribe robert bloch maintains a snappy pace throughout and does an ace job of creating a suitably eerie atmosphere kudos are also in order for ray parslow's crisp cinematography and the shuddery score by michael dress highly recommended to fans of omnibus fright fare
<START> across the country and especially in the political landscape people with any kind of political ambition should take time out to see this film the movie is called city hall and with little imagination its synopsis can take place anywhere in america it just so happens to open in new york here we have the story of a popular politician named mayor john pappas al pacino with enough savvy to run a major metropolitan city with very little effort his right hand man is none other than deputy mayor kevin calhoun john cusack an equally bright individual who's ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office everything points in that direction until a police shooting ignites an investigation spearheaded by marybeth cogan bridget fonda who believes the guilt points towards city hall and the mayor a six year old boy and a police officer's death are blamed on a career criminal who's questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover up by political pay offs and city corruption involving union leaders like danny aiello played by frank anselmo corrupt judicial officials like judge walter stern martin landau and mafia bosses like paul zapatti anthony franciosa who are deeply involved also implicated are party officials like larry schwartz richard schiff who works for the probation office of new york but it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting a great vehicle for cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic
<START> the subject notwithstanding this is an amateur exhibitionist movie or an effort at one which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student's composition book full of death poetry to be sure it will disturb viewers who are hell bent on being disturbed but the success will be attributable to themselves not to the director to genuinely get under somebody's skin requires sensibility discipline technique and talent as well as an eye and an ear the film does contain one evocative image shown as a still and also used on the video case but with no development leading up to or away from it if the director had had an eye he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie that is a movie
<START> as a kid my friends and i all believed that gymkata was the most violent bloody movie ever made i'm not sure who started that rumor it was probably born out of the frustration of 10 year olds who weren't allowed to see it for one reason or other years after gymkata was released it became a perennial late night cable movie and as a result i've been able to make up for lost time i must have seen scenes from this dreadful excuse for a film over a dozen times and i can always spot it from 1 2 seconds of screen time however aside from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts the bad dubbing the stiff dialog and the outrageously difficult story line the film has some things going for it with all that's bad about the movie visually the sound is actually pretty entertaining never before has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume the canned kung fu sounds are cheeky but the slowed and pitched down music and the nearly 5 minute slow motion scene are truly weird the chase through the city of demented blood thirsty villagers isn't really tense as much as it is irritating and there are enough bad wigs and extras who all but look into the camera and wave to make this train wreck a little fun could it be headed for cult classic status where is mst3k when we need it
