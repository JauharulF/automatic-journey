<START> i saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed its so bad that it is actually funny in a very cringe worthy way br br gael is absolutely terrible i mean he just cannot act period he should give up now as acting is clearly not his thing his co stars are about the same caliber i'm sure my 5 year old cousin could do a better job than all of them the director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous somehow i don't think an oscar is on the cards for this guy br br i have never written a comment on imdb but this movie was so bad i felt compelled to do so br br if you get the chance to see this film don't 0 10 if there was a 0
<START> you should know that i am the type of person that watches even the worst of movies to the finish often out of sheer morbid curiosity i even watched leprechaun to the end before giving in to the temptation of tearing out my eyes and stamping on them you should also know that this movie was in my vcr for less than half an hour before i made a frantic leap for the stop button and dashed back the rental store just to put as much distance between me and it as possible
<START> the thief of baghdad is one of my ten all time favorite movies it is exciting without gore it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless the casting couldn't have been better rex ingram made me believe in genies and the epitome of evil is certainly captured by conrad veight as jafar he set the bar very high br br i watch this movie at least twice a year and never tire of it this film is an adventure for all ages no one too old to enjoy it the thief of bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time i was ten years old the first time i saw it and the u s was just about to enter wwii conrad vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying evilness a few years later in casablanca and korda teamed up i believe with justin and dupree again in the four feathers great film making
<START> i watched this film because i'm a big fan of river phoenix and joaquin phoenix i thought i would give their sister a try rain phoenix i regret checking it out she was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it sissy was just weird and jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains whats going on i have never been so unsatisfied in my life it was just total rubbish i can't believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film money time and space have sissy being 'beautiful' didnt get to me i thought she was everything but that those thumbs were just stupid and why do we care if she can hitchhike whats the point 0 out of 10 shame the poll doesnt have a 0 doesnt even deserve a 1 hopefully rain is better in other films i forgive her for this one performance i mean i wouldnt do much better with that film
<START> i watched the film recently and it poorly resembles the book is based on i blame this on poor screenplay and direction some parts were forcibly introduced the gay rape scene for no apparent reason i actually read the book after watching the movie and some 20 years or so after reading it for the first time i found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy too many disparate ideas introduced for no benefit at all other than sensational parts for the time as it covers stuff that was deemed 'sensitive' to say the least during communism i can see the fascination it produced at the time that isn't the case anymore though or maybe i see things differently now or a bit of both the film tries too much to cover many aspects from the book the result being a concoction of scenes that may make some sense to someone who read the book even so this is a film that is difficult to watch and maybe should have never been made
<START> this movie was one of the best movies that i have seen this year i didn't see any cameos in the movie but it is still pretty good it is similar to anchorman in the humor department but i think this is a better put together movie it actually has a point if you are going to see a whole bunch of t a you will be disappointed just a well put together movie if you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor you will find this to be a really good movie i definitely think that ebert and roeper's review of this movie is right on i mean i don't really like ebert on most movies but this is the movie that i will agree about the movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie yea sure you get laughed at when it is found out about but it still suggests that you wait steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet it is still funny
<START> i think the biggest failing something can have is to be boring bad is actually better than boring this thing has no breath it does have the interesting fact of taking place in cambodia how many american made films of the 30's take place in cambodia nevertheless the conflict there is a little hard to figure out even the troop movements are a little confusing what drags it to a resounding halt is the love story why those two guys are so totally transfixed on the dippy blonde i don't know i thought he should continue to use his zombies such as they are and forget all about her the movie just plods along the perfect microcosm is where one of the principle characters follows a cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphics or whatever that explain how to turn people into zombies is kept i thought they would never get there one guy takes two steps he stops he looks around the other guy hides behind some columns he takes two steps he stops he looks around the other guy hides behind some bushes this is the movie in a nutshell then there is the bad acting and insipid dialogue i actually have a lot of patience when it comes to b movies this one is insufferable by the way a more apt title would be revolt of the hypnotized
<START> this is my all time favorite fred astaire and ginger rogers film the dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two like i'm putting all my eggs in one basket and let's face the music and dance if i remember correctly this was the film that introduced me to fred astaire so i suppose because of that it will always hold a special place in my heart sorry for the sentimental cr p but i'm woman so get over it all in all this film gets an 8 10 from me the choreography was superb and also the fact that lucille ball is in it makes it even more awesome
<START> i recently purchassed the very underrated dreamcast and went off into town to find some games to use them on i bought soul calibur a classic and then i stepped across the domain of resident evil code veronica i have resident evil 1 2 and have played res evil 3 numerous occasions and i have been impressed with all of them especially no 1 which has to go down in history has a classic br br but none of them 3 come anywhere near to the dreamcast attempt of brilliant gory gameplay if its just for the sake of buying a dreamcast for this game it is worth every moment of your time and effort ive never been so enthralled over a computer game in the way this has enthralled me br br anyway the story carrys on from the 2nd story in which claire redfield searches for her brother chris from the 1st story who is presumed missing under the conspiracy of the dreaded umbrella corporation little is known about this corporation except the fact that you though you destroyed them 3 times in the previous storys br br so aiding claire with the assistant of super brat steve u must unlock the truth of the real location of your brother the 2nd cd enables you to control chris thats if you manage to get that far without running out of the room in fear br br the control are very slick and the movement of the characters are magnificently realistic when the character notices danger he she faces the direction it is coming from pure genius br br overall i gave this game 10 10 because it is simply the game of the year game of the decade and the best game in the world full stop please purchase this game as soon as possible
<START> the rookie suffers from so much there are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make jerry lewis blush noonan and leavitt just don't know when to quit it takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked then the guys start playing japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day it is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when noonan and leavitt are playing the stupid stereotyped japanese guys but it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters then it just abruptly ends even a naked julie newmar in a towel can't save this one br br there is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long the story just flounders along trying to set up funny situations and failing stick to martin lewis at least deano had charm and jerry had that animated face
<START> it's terrible how some people can get away with such things this is one of those overrated things again and i hate things that are overrated that are no good why can't we have more tv shows and movies that actually have a story and excellent music and that are well written and are actually about something it takes many people to make this movie the series and the band all possible and those people are all wasting their time it seems that the bands are getting younger and younger i looked at how small that they were and i thought that they were 5 or 6 it's sad that kids are performing that young they are still too young performing takes a lot of work and they have many other things that they need to do with their lives the idea about having a very young band is horrible they need to stop having bands like this and i don't like the idea at all nor the kids themselves they are very annoying very young and their name is the naked brothers band the people that are involved in this and the people that are supporting this have all lost their minds whenever this band is shown on tv change the channel and petition to get it banned br br and i know that this is a very boring comment thing but you get the point br br this band sucks get rid of it
<START> this does give away some of the plot by the way a charlie brown christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value christmas and just enjoying the holiday this however does not it tries to capture the emotion of a charlie brown christmas there even is another christmas play but fails with lackluster and easy jokes charlie brown is no longer wondering about the spirit of christmas but is instead wants to buy a present for peggy jean 25 gloves what his sister sally is the most annoying character in the movie here is one of her jokes sally wants to write a letter to santa but doesn't know how to spell charlie for some reason he needs to be in her letter so instead decides to name him sam because she knows how to spell sam also sally plays an angel in the play with one word to day hark she instead says hockey stick har har if sally saying hark 12 times all oddly sounding exactly the same doesn't kill you nothing will peppermint patty and marcy are a large focal point but that hardly makes it better marcy is funny with her responses to patty but patty is another story she sounds like a boy which doesn't dispel the rumors and gets mad when she has to be the sheep in the play terrible baas and all apparently she is the sheep every year and is worried she will forget her lines lines she doesn't have she is so worried she mentions it twice one right after the other and gets the same response i'm assuming she must have short term memory loss or something lucy and linus are more welcome although linus still has annoying advice but hardly amount to much air time i'm sure schroeder isn't even in this one all in all it tries to be a parasite to the original but compromised the message for a few quick laughs
<START> both visually and musically stunning a treat for both the eye and the ear the quintessential victorian element of the opening sequences were completely enchanting helping to create a christmas scene of which dickens himself would have been justifiably proud technically the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both imaginatively devised and creatively achieved in a traditional stage setting the dancing of many of the lead artistes is breathtakingly good the photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording admirably matches the overall high level of technical skills employed a great film for all the family at christmas time and a most delightful discovery which will withstand multiple viewing
<START> i am sure there is some sort of imdb cult that likes movies that mst3k made fun of after seeing both this and werewolf and reading dozens of comments about how underated they are i became convinced that there is some conpiricy going on here alot of people are saying that people who hate it are only scared by gore don't know good horror or stuff like that well i don't really care for gore but i do want something to happen in a movie most of it is just the wife sitting and looking around or walking around the house garden a movie requires something to give it atmosphoere you don't get it by just have pointless scenes were someone walks around and stares oh and makes you think yeah i was thinking move you 0 one of the worst horror movie i have ever scene br br p s for the record i am a big fan of the old style of horror dracula frankenstein that kind of stuff
<START> can such an ambient production have failed its primary goal which was to correctly adapt allende's novel obviously yes bille august managed to make a superficial shallow film where basic elements of south american mentality are presented simply as side events resulting in total incoherency i can't believe there was a whole production team that could not understand the book there is of course technical quality in this film and i think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands but something is missing and this something was the most important part
<START> the original vanishing point was a great flick subtle motives characters that seemed real and spontaneous the remake was terrible preachy overtly obvious it missed the point as to why the original was a classic the black charger was cool but even that couldn't rescue this flick why stick with a white challenger i didn't think that was the best choice back in '71 some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious like when vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his dream quest his indian pal was standing next to him vigo was only wearing his white briefs i'm sorry it just looked silly him surveying the vista in his fruit of the looms another scene was at the end after the explosive crash into the bulldosers the announcer said that the impact was clocked at 180 mph then he mentions that the cops said his remains weren't found because he vaporized but some people believe he bailed out and was hidden by friends in the crowd then it shows him rolling out of the car at 180 mph first of all you couldn't open the car door at 180 mph secondly the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds with nobody to steer it it would promptly roll over about 30 times thirdly if you hit the pavement at 180 mph you would wind up in various squishy pieces no matter we see him at the end standing with his daughter all in all a movie that would insult anyone's intelligence
<START> this is by far the worst film i have seen in my entire life the acting is poor and the storyline is almost incomprehensible whether or not you like lightships or any ships for that matter is irrelevant as for special effects the film has none the whole film crew were probably on the boat out in rough seas rather than in a studio and when some of the men are stabbed if you can even call it that their reactions are totally unreal the guns are more quiet than a mute how this film could have one two awards puts serious questions to the state of the human mind well thats about it this review is probably more fun to read than the film is to watch if anyone is considering watching it or buying it i would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons i have said that it includes a spoiler if the fact that some people get stabbed and a gun gets fired is a plot giveaway i suppose it is because they are the only good parts of the film
<START> friz freleng's 'speedy gonzalez' was the second cartoon to feature the title character after robert mckimson's 'cat tails for two' in that cartoon speedy has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted despite looking significantly more handsome speedy never developed into much of a character a big hat tremendous speed and a bad mexican accent do not a classic character make and that's pretty much all speedy ever had going for him nevertheless the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and went on to star in many shorts including some truly abysmal films from the studio's latter days while these early speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequently rather oddly paired up with daffy duck they still leave much to be desired relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar chase formula in this self titled episode speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be guarded by sylvester the cat although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon sylvester's role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat his personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable undemanding role of pursuer this was always a problem in the tweety cartoons too but speedy makes an even duller adversary thanks to his detestable cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his capture poor old sylvester would be forced to appear alongside speedy for many years to come despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs 'speedy gonzalez' won an oscar and a thoroughly undeserving star was born
<START> this will be somewhat short first don't listen to the critics as it is not as bad as most say it is sniper uses a classic movie formula which many dismiss immediately as flawing the movie while sniper does not reflect the 100 truth about how our country's military snipers work it does give those who know nothing about the professional sniper a glimpse into the world of the sniper and yes the movie has many flaws but what movie doesn't there are many good scenes and good acting by tom berenger i have to say the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with billy zane in the helicopter followed by zane in the marine's bar scene the best scene in sniper is with berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing force sweeping it also there are plenty of good shots of the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as though you are looking through a riflescope and yes the sniper motto is one shot one kill' judge sniper for yourself br br
<START> what do you expect when there is no script to begin with and therefore nothing that the director can work with hayek and farrell and donaldson and kirkin are good actors they just don't have anything to say or anything to react to even the earthquake was pretty poor and i don't know how closely the movie follows the novel but two have the jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that arturo has a nice warm heart but some stereotypes don't amount to anything and he even buries camilla out in the desert instead of bringing her back to l a for a nice catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while pathetic and the l a set was ridiculously graphically created anything good the window to his apartment felt real the curtains the sounds the wind and donaldson is always great has been since the body snatchers or night of the living dead whichever it was
