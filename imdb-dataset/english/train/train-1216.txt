<START> the movie was disappointing the book was powerful the views and the learning of little tree were powerfully portrayed in the book the movie just coasted along and finally dribbled away still a nice tale for kids
<START> have just seen the australian premiere of shower xizhao at the sydney film festival the program notes said it was a perfect delight deftly made touching amusing dramatic and poignantly meaningful i couldn't agree more i just hope the rest of the festival films come up to this standard of entertainment and i look forward to seeing more chinese films planned to be shown in sydney in the coming months
<START> kudos to director and cast for such a realistic film the grittiness lack of glamor and desperation drew me into the film and kept me there i was truly impressed by how dates and information were relayed within the film ie newspapers letters etc it kept the film moving at such a fast pace i didn't feel the urge to fast forward once personally i thought all the principles did a tremendous job it was great to see bosworth and kudrow in such difficult roles it made me want to cry at times val kilmer didn't surprise me his performances of this nature usually leave me in awe overall this is a brilliant film not to be missed
<START> that's right you heard me i am a huge fan of james patterson i own 10 of his books and i have read the entire series about lindsey boxer in my opinion the screenwriter should be shot br br what right did any film maker have to slaughter a terrific work of fiction and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre if i ever thought that harry potter was butchered then michael o'hara has proved me wrong br br i can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do it a great deal more justice to michael o'hara and russell mulcahy don't quit your day job
<START> this film is a wonderfully simplistic work enjoyable from start to end it is both sad yet uplifting at the same time the performances from miranda otto oh how she deserves so much more recognition and george del hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch as the two tortured souls come to understand each other the supporting cast of workers at the dead letter office are wonderful bit parts in them selves as is alice's long suffering boyfriend who i couldn't help but feel slightly sorry for there's one particular scene i could watch over and over and i have it's such a shame that films like these don't get recognition and therefore bring them futher into the public eye for more people to enjoy i cried i laughed and i sighed i'd recommend this film to anyone
<START> bette midler is indescribable in this concert she gives her all every time she is on stage whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads bette midler moves her audience if you can't see it live which is the best way to see bette then this is the next best thing an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power her more vocally correct version of stay with me never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever i will treasure this concert for a very long time
<START> it is hard to describe bug in words it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood it follows a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything i have seen lately in a hollywood release as its characters react to the chain of events in different ways and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow the audience is merely an observer the almost proustian narrative flow of thought to thought the very spontaneity in the script will have you glued to the screen waiting anxiously to see how it all works out in the end and as far as the thematic elements there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy to bright and beautiful and then to tragic all within the span of about a minute and it works br br this movie is pure magic it reminds one why independent film is perhaps the brightest star the film industry currently has perhaps with more movies of bug's quality people will start to take notice
<START> sydney lumet although one of the oldest active directors still got game a few years ago he shot find me guilty a proof to everyone that vin diesel can actually act if he gets the opportunity and the right director if he had retired after this movie a true masterpiece in my eyes no one could have blamed him but he's still going strong his next movie already announced for 2009 br br but let's stay with this movie right here the cast list is incredible their performance top notch the little nuances in their performances the real dialogue and or situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing the time structure of the movie that keeps your toes the whole time blending time lines so seamlessly that the editing seems natural flawless the story is heightened by that although even in a normal time structure it would've been at least a good movie drama thriller i can only highly recommend it the rest is up to you o
<START> woody allen's second movie set in london tha tarot card murderer is killing prostitutes in london aspiring journalist sondra pransky scarlett johansson gets a tip that he may be lord peter lyman hugh jackman she starts to romance him but quickly falls in love she's helped by stage magician sid waterman woody allen who doesn't like what he sees br br i like this better than the over rated match point from last year it was shorter and moved much more quickly the plot is old but i was entertained and it kept me guessing till the very end it's not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines all from allen of course it's not one of allen's best but it's far better than his worst br br the acting is for the most part very good allen is bad but he's played this character a million times before and it's gotten tiresome but johansson and jackman are just great they look fantastic and give two very appealing believable performances also allen surprisingly works on their sex appeal there is a sequence where they're both in the their bathing suits to show off their nice bodies the only real debit is that allen still seems unsure on how to shot london he's not as off as he was on match point though maybe he'll just get better as he goes along br br worth seeing i give it an 8
<START> a country boy aussie rules player mat goes to the city the night before an all important afl trial match where he is to be picked up by his cousin and then things go wrong br br his no hoper cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan shark drug dealer tiny who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitively australian needless to say mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos and it isn't long before thoughts of tomorrow's match are shunted to the back of his mind as the night's frantic events unravel br br accomplished western australian professional shakespearean actor toby malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country boy mat and successfully plays a part well below his age best support comes from john batchelor as tiny and an entertaining role by david ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events roll is fast paced often funny and a very worthwhile use of an hour
<START> the wife of a stage producer in london hopes to fix up the american song and dance man starring in her husband's latest show with an acquaintance an american girl who makes her living modeling fashions in society circles unfortunately the couple has already met on their own with the girl thinking the guy is actually the show producer married to her friend the fact he's not wearing a wedding ring should have discouraged any misunderstandings wafty fred astaire ginger rogers musical is eventually dragged back down to the earth by dwight taylor and allan scott's idiotic script which is full of juvenile behavior astaire and rogers don't just 'meet cute' they meet ridiculously he's tap dancing like a madman in the hotel suite above hers and she complains audiences of 1935 probably didn't care how these two were going to get together as long as they did so and happily seen today the central characters appear to have no motivation to end up in each other's arms he plies her with flowers after telling his friend he wants to remain fancy free in the love department and she gives him the brush off nothing that a little dancing couldn't cure this glamorous twosome are as deliberately unreal as are the london and venice settings but we watch simply because the leads are fred and ginger it's a fantasy for have nots ones who don't mind the dumbed down plot the musical moments do break up the monotony of the contrived scenario yet fail to transcend the surrounding silliness from
<START> well would firstly like to clarify that kaakha kaakha is a part of a tamil prayer and roughly translated it means to protect khakhee on the other hand refers to the color of the police uniform which is khakhi br br also the tamil film industry is rather full of purely commercial ventures any rajnikanth or vijay movie would stand testament to that statement br br now kaakha kaakha is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack certainly very stunning in the final scene especially love the ending which is certainly unexpected the gore is rather too much at times but certainly this is a great movie
<START> greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers this film opens with incest and purposeless meaningless casual incest at that that's greenaway's big problem he prefers parlor tricks to shock over actually doing anything meaningful technical skill isn't enough he's just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity
<START> after losing the emmy for her performance as mama rose in the television version of gypsy bette won an emmy the following year for bette midler diva las vegas a live concert special filmed for hbo from las vegas midler who has been performing live on stage since the 1970's proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business from her opening number her classic friends where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap styled number called i look good she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections the section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old sophie tucker jokes here to good advantage even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it but her ad libbing until she remembers it is hysterical bette also treats us to rose's turn from gypsy and the title tune from her smash film the rose as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie the first wives club she brings the house down near the end with stay with me baby from the rose and her only 1 hit record wind beneath my wings from beaches it's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for midler fans it's a must
<START> nay sayers of this film are likely bitter from some seriously unrequited love this is a great film for anyone capable of understanding johnny mathis's song or any song from that era bobby darin's beyond the sea or stan getz's the girl from ipanema et al br br i measure films by how many times i have to watch them before i'm satisfied chances are had me back a few good times br br i also watch the synergy between the cast i thought they worked well together br br open your heart and let the comedic magic of film transport you br br 'alan
<START> i jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted remembering rahs and raves for it but wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary it backed off and went somewhere else the dripping water throughout the house the black rain the prophetic dreams taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream br br what a disappointment chamberlain's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief something i found myself mirroring as the film wore on what could have been eerie aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head the ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods that the aboriginal peoples believe red haired white men were the first priests and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension the dream time br br spoiler in the final scene it wasn't clear to me what the director was trying to tell is there a big wave so what how big a tsunami yeah okay that's devastating but not apocalyptic is it the end of the world from a wave the last wave that'd have to be a pretty darn big wave why was the world that bad a place it didn't seem so awful in this movie actually i didn't think the wave came off since the shadow left burton's face that had been cast by the wave was it only burton's apocalypse heck that happens every day to people who lose it it wasn't of any interest if it was only him br br the most frightening scene and the one that gives the best indication of weir's potential was in charlie's apartment where burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring burton's wife charlie keeps asking him who are you and it becomes truly disturbing after a while unfortunately the movie never followed suit
<START> i absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end after you've already invested an hour into it and that's what happened with this film i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story i haven't gone to read that story but i cannot imagine that it ends like this film ends fortunately i didn't pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting the wife in particular was so perfect but milo o'shea as a jew now that was funny i haven't researched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died 3 4 of the way through the film before that point a story and characters were developing there were a number of neat plot points and there wasn't too much time wasted but ooh that last 1 2 hour if that wasn't the screwiest most worthless denouement i've ever witnessed i don't know what is i just hate it when one's faith is so destroyed like that it feels like an act of violence
<START> i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on tv br br the one scene that always stands out for me that is is the one with the myrna loy and the painters foreman where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says did you get that that's yellow blue green and white
<START> in the citadel film series book the films of gene kelly anchors aweigh is described as a kingpin of a musical i sure can't do better than that it's such an important film in both the careers of gene kelly and frank sinatra kathryn grayson didn't do too badly with this either br br louis b mayer had lent gene kelly out to columbia where harry cohn had an inspiration to let kelly choreograph his own numbers and because of it cover girl became a classic so if mayer didn't learn a lesson producer joe pasternak did and allowed kelly artistic control when anchors aweigh was finished fred astaire at last had a dancing rival for monarch of cinema dance br br the main number everyone talks about with gene kelly here is the dance with jerry mouse originally kelly wanted to do the number with walt disney's mickey mouse but disney wasn't lending mickey out to nobody mickey would have to wait until who framed roger rabbit to do an outside film not to worry because mgm had it's own animated rodent one half the team of tom and jerry br br kelly as dancer always strived to do something new and different on screen as did fred astaire for the next dozen years these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves weren't up to snuff it was like each inspired the other to bigger and better creativity kelly for mgm astaire for mgm and any number of other studios in anchors aweigh kelly got sinatra to dance a bit in fact frank sinatra always gave credit to gene kelly for showing him how musicals should be done as he gave credit to both burt lancaster and montgomery clift for their help in earning him is oscar for from here to eternity br br when frank sinatra had half of his contract bought from rko by mgm he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own he'd become friends with the songwriting team of jule styne and sammy cahn in his autobiography sammy cahn tells about how sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film louis b mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads for him to sing one of my favorite sinatra numbers comes from anchors aweigh i fall in love too easily frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty hollywood bowl it's sinatra at his best br br with jule styne and later with jimmy van heusen sammy cahn richly earned the title of having put more song lyrics in frank sinatra's mouth than any other person they were lifetime friends and cahn always credited sinatra with this milestone boost in his career br br on a bet styne and cahn said they could write a song just using a chromatic scale they proved it in anchors aweigh when kathryn grayson put her soprano to work on all of a sudden my heart sings she also did some classical numbers br br here singing in fact is the basis of the plot two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with kathryn grayson and her orphaned nephew dean stockwell trying to fix her up with sinatra kelly says he can get her an audition with jose iturbi they spend the film trying to accomplish just that br br my only disappointment in anchors aweigh was that pamela britton who plays the waitress 'brooklyn' never got a number herself she had gotten rave reviews from her performance as meg brockie in brigadoon on broadway and that's what brought her to hollywood i have a suspicion she had a number that was cut and somewhere in mgm's vaults it might still be br br anchors aweigh is a great example of why musicals just aren't made any more all that creative talent was under contract to metro goldwyn mayer if you had to pay market value for it the cost might retire some third world country's debt br br but the film results would be extraordinary
<START> i don't understand why the other comments focus on mcconaughey he has never been a very interesting film actor br br the best part of this movie is the writing and the wit alfred molina and patrick mcgaw make an unusual comic duo definitely not stock types although one can't say their characters are well developed that doesn't make them any less funny br br the version i saw was on hdnet and had subtitles for the spanish dialog so that was certainly not a problem the use of spanish gives it more authenticity br br a very underrated movie judging by the unusually low score imdb members have given it i thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting
