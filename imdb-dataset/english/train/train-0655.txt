<START> deceptive advertising i saw a commercial for carlitos way rise to power that states from the producer of scarface and carlito's way lets get it straight michael bergman did not produce scarface in fact he was 'editing room assistant' for scarface not to take away from bergman's talent but in my opinion he should of had a little more class i think i can speak for the masses when i say we hate being blatantly lied to as far as the movie goes it was poor at best i did think puff daddy did a good job although luis guzman should be ashamed for working on this film overall this film did not do a good job filling in the blanks for carlito's way it's obvious this project was an attempt to make a quick buck rather a good film
<START> you're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse i rated the audie murphy movie a 3 i'm a harsh grader the second lowest i ever gave audie the worst being battle at bloody beach if you're curious i give this movie a rating of 8 and i'm a harsh grader it's the civil war story of renegade soldiers if you want to call them that against the north people like quantrell and the men who rode with these outlaws br br the original was a watery version very clean cut while still depicting the horror of what these men did actually movies such as the older version are best viewed by mature audiences who can discern the story i would be more apt to rate the original r and this one with it's gruff nature a gp because the newer movie gives a very honest version a message more easily deciphered by a juvenile than the older version br br film makers since the early sixties have boasted about realism but few of them deliver instead they just give the drab scenery drab costumes and drab events but with comic book cardboard stereotype characters the weakness of the spaghetti era br br modern film makers have realized this mistake it is evident in a superior style of western we usually see today this movie is an example it gives the realistic settings but also gives us characters we can believe exist in that era br br it has a few lulls which makes a complete sit through a bit hard and it has some unexplained situations but unexplained situations are okay as long the entire movie holds up and the characters are intriguing enough br br it begins a bit campy but really improves the main character is one we can identify and at least have some sympathy for the audie murphy character of the early movie really evokes no sympathy and is too self righteous without motivation br br the character in this movie follows the lines of a true anti hero there is motivation and a method to his madness we never feel he is truly right but we can understand where he comes from br br there is plenty of action in the movie there is also some humor one good scene is when the heroine tells the hero she wouldn't lie to him and he mulls that over br br this movie succeeds in doing what film makers have been trying to do for decades this director and writer team got it right br br recommended complete success
<START> hard to believe perhaps but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose hayes code yes indeed priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sin br br i'm not making this up they had several reasons as follows br br item jane likes sex she and tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter she stretches sensuously and with a coquettish look she says tarzan you've been a bad boy so they've not only been having sex they've been having kinky sex a few years later under the hays code people especially women weren't supposed to be depicted as enjoying sex br br item jane prefers a guileless if wise and resourceful savage tarzan to a civilized respectable nine to five man holt when holt at first wows her with a pretty dress from london she wavers a bit when holt tries to kill tarzan and holt and jane both believe he's dead she wavers a lot but when she realizes her man is very much alive the attractions of civilization vanish for her and why not tarzan's and jane's relationship is egalitarian he lacks the civilized insecurity that would compel him to assert himself as the head of his wife to boot he lacks many more civilized hangups for example jealousy when holt and his buddy arrive tarzan greets them both cordially knowing perfectly well that holt is jane's old flame when holt gets her dolled up in a london dress and is slow dancing with her to a portable phonograph tarzan drops out of a tree and draws his knife jealous nope he's merely cautious toward the weird music machine since he's never seen one before once it's explained he's cool br br item civilized holt is dirty minded savage tarzan is innocently sexy as jane slips into holt's lamplit tent holt gets off on watching her silhouette as she changes into the fancy dress by contrast after tarzan playfully pulls the dress off kicks her into the swimming hole and dives in after her there follows the most tastefully erotic nude scene in all cinema the pair spends five minutes in a lovely water ballet the scene was filmed in three versions clothed topless and nude the scene was cut prior to the film's release but the nude version is restored in the video now available and when jane emerges and cheetah the chimp steals her dress just for a tease jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of civilized men and their hangups where is the universal prurience so dear to the hearts of seminarians nowhere that's where another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful br br item the notion that man is the crown of creation and animals are here only for man's use and comfort takes a severe beating holt and his buddy want to be guided to the elephant graveyard so they can scoop up the ivory and take it home they want tarzan to guide them to said graveyard you reader are thinking fat chance and you're right he's shocked he exclaims elephants sleep which to him explains everything jane explains tarzan's feelings which the two gentlemen find ridiculous br br item jane the ex civilized woman is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies holt and buddy blow it and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals it is jane who maintains her cool while the boys panic she takes charge barks orders at them and passes out the rifles br br item jane's costume is a sort of poncho with nothing underneath the original idea was for her to be topless with foliage artistically blocking off her nipples which indeed is the case in one brief scene br br lastly several men of the cloth complained because the film was called tarzan and his mate rather than tarzan and his wife no comment br br of course tarzan who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends comes to the rescue routs the white hunters and induces the pack elephants and african bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came the end br br so there you have it an utterly subversive film like all the other films about complex and interesting women see e g possessed with rita hayworth and raymond massey which constituted such a flowing genre in the early 30's and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the hays code br br the joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by jane's soprano version of the famous tarzan yell a nice touch which was unfortunately abandoned in future productions br br let's hear it for artistic freedom feminist jane and sex
<START> when i went to watch this movie my expectations were really low but i was pleasantly surprised br br i thought i was going to watch a boring teen flick but in fact the plot is interesting and well executed the acting was somewhat convincing especially from melville who really shows his talent in this movie and the fight scenes were for a low budget movie very well done br br i think this movie deserves a broader audience than it has received it is a movie which can be seen by the whole family maybe not the smallest of kids since it contains some rather rough scenes a movie about love and the problems that can occur when you go against your family traditions br br yes the movie is very much like bend it like beckham but i actually think this movie pulls it off better
<START> i really like this film when i started to watch it i thought i would get bored pretty soon but it surprised me i thought it was a great film and have seen it a few times now the characters are believable and i have to say that i fell in love with brian austin green all over again the first time being beverly hills 90210 i would recommend this film if you are a fan of his but i do agree with another comment made earlier that the ending is sort of disappointing i would have loved it to turn out a little different never mind though good gripping story
<START> life pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard the acting is rather amateurish at best the special effects are obviously low budget but not too bad the story line is rather stock but with an interesting twist computer run amok but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable for me at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of kristine debell she may not be the greatest actress in the world but having been a former playmate of the month she is cute enough in all life pod is much like other low budget sci fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable br br the white star lines bit is cute if completely inaccurate the last of the white star lines company stock was purchased by the cunard lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the white star colors was the britannic not the sister of titanic which was sold for scrap in 1960
<START> the fury of the wolfman is a very good film that has a good cast which includes paul naschy jacinto molina perla cristal verÃ³nica lujÃ¡n mark stevens francisco amorÃ³s fabiÃ¡n conde miguel de la riva ramÃ³n lillo josÃ© marco javier de rivera and pilar zorrilla the acting by all of these actors is very good the wolfman is really cool he looks great and he sound like the looney tunes character the tazmainian devil there are some really hilarious scenes in this film the thrills is really good and some of it is surprising the movie is filmed very good the music is good the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end this is a very good and thrilling film if you like paul naschy jacinto molina perla cristal verÃ³nica lujÃ¡n mark stevens francisco amorÃ³s fabiÃ¡n conde miguel de la riva ramÃ³n lillo josÃ© marco javier de rivera pilar zorrilla the rest of the cast in the film werewold films horror sci fi thrillers dramas and interesting classic films then i strongly recommend you to see this film today br br movie nuttball's note br br i got this film on a special dvd that has doctor blood's coffin the brainiac and the fury of the wolfman from vintage home entertainment see if you can find this winner with three bizarre but classic films on one dvd at amazon com today br br if you like werewolf films i strongly recommend these werewolf of london 1935 the wolf man 1941 frankenstein meets the wolf man 1943 house of frankenstein 1944 abbott an d costell meets frankenstein 1948 the curse of the werewolf 1961 an american werewolf in london 1981 silver bullet 1985 werewolf 1987 the monster squad 1987 my mom's a werewolf 1989 project metalbeast 1995 bad moon 1996 werewolf 1996 dog soldiers 2002 underworld 2003 and van helsing 2004
<START> i thought that my favorite martian was very boring and drawn out it was not funny at all the audience just sat through the whole movie and didn't laugh at all not even the kids laughed that is sad for a disney movie i thought they could have found somebody better to play the martian rather than christopher lloyd he was really stupid and he was not funny i thought the talking suit was really dumb in the original television series the suit doesn't talk and move around in my opinion they should not have wasted their time on this movie i give it two thumbes down really a waste of time and i would not recommend the movie to anybody thank you
<START> thankfully saw this on a plane to singapore recently thought i'd missed it at the cinemalaya filmfest paris je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films about 5 mins each by 20 directors showing love in various pockets of contemporary paris br br one of my fave segments is 'parc monceau' by alfonso cuarn great expectations harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban which was done in one continuous shot and features nick nolte br br the coen brothers' 'tuileries' starring steve buscemi as a tourist in the metro was hilarious juliette binoche and willem dafoe in 'place des victoires' was haunting br br for maggie gyllenhaal as an american actress druggie in 'quartier des enfants rouges' to have portrayed anticipation and heartbreak in such a short period of time was just brilliant br br elijah wood as a vampire victim in 'quartier de la madeleine' was pretty surreal while emily mortimer and rufus sewell played a cute couple in wes craven's 'pre lachaise' br br natalie portman was beautiful as usual as the actress girlfriend of a visually impaired french boy in 'faubourg saint denis' but despite the many portrayals of young love a more mature execution by gena rowlands in 'quartier latin' was equally aww inducing br br this movie is perfect for those with adhd because each sequence is driven and carefully thought of br br there are also a number of memorable quotes one in particular is this one from a cheating husband who eventually leaves his mistress to stay with his dying wife in her last days in pretending to be a man in love he became a man in love
<START> long before tim lahaye and jerry b jenkins would shake the world of the christian subculture and make millions in the process with the left behind books mark iv pictures the christian film distribution company of the billy graham evangelistic association gave us this masterwork what i love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail sitting in a living room instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this post rapture tribulation we sit in the living room hearing about it on the news because the filmmakers can't afford to show it the film's premise is grounded in pre millenial pre tribulation eschatalogy believing that christ comes once for the secret taking of the true church and then comes again at the end of the seven years of hell on earth what used to terrify me in junior high now makes me laugh the intriguing adventures of patty and her journey throughout the tribulation and two of the film's three sequels tells her remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately damnation i hate to admit it but i still thoroughly enjoy watching this it even has the same exact score of monty python and the holy grail i think i'm the only person in history to make that observation
<START> a chinese scholar who criticizes harshly the arrogant nationalist warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre war japan is accused of being a 'communist' and jailed for life his loving wife who supports totally her husband and his ideas is left alone to save her family from starvation this movie is a huge statue erected in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind sayuri yoshinaga is not less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she didn't get an asian oscar for the best female role in 2009 it went to a young girl with very limited acting potential br br this deeply moving and most 'human' feature is a must see for all 'true children' on earth
<START> first off i would like to say that i am a fan of chris rock i like his other movies but this movie is just like my summary the biggest sack of crap ever in the beginning chris rock plays an aspiring comedian who get stage fright at a comedy building called the apollo on his way home from a gig while riding his bike he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a truck a little while later he chooses the body of an old white and selfish millionaire then he dresses up like the music group outkast while trying to replay the scene from the original where he comes out as a jockey second he goes back to the apollo and tries to be the comedian he tried to be in his previous body and starts dissing the white population and tries to be black do you get my drift this movie is awful it tries too hard to be like the original and in the process comes out looking like a sack of crap just take my advice don't even watch this movie
<START> i did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a welles box set i had recently purchased a box set i chiefly got because i wanted to own a man for all seasons and to also re evaluate waterloo so i stick orson and rita in the player and i'm treated to class and confusion in equal measure br br on the surface the story seemed a simple one man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs they click straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband and then br br well it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans michael o'hara orson welles himself doesn't really know what is going on he is as confused as the viewer is and that is wonderful to watch as he is pulled all over the place by pretty much everyone in the film obviously being pulled by the heart strings by a femme fatale of such beauty as elsa bannister rita hayworth has its moments but you just know that things are going to go pear shaped br br so many wonderful things in the film it has welles visual style all over it see a scene in an aquarium that is marvellous and the ending sequences in a fun house is majestic on the eye the narration from o'hara is joyously self mocking and we get good light relief by way of a court case with everett sloane considerably lighting up proceedings br br yet the film is an oddity and in fact it's a choppy viewing experience because as i was to find out after studio bosses cut the film by pretty much a whole hour and that is just not only frustrating to us the viewer but unfair on welles' vision i'm positive that a full original cut of this film would have been lauded and revered wholesale as it is tho we have a very good and intriguing film one that sadly only hints at greatness but remains a fiendishly engrossing film that i'm glad i own to revisit further 8 5 10
<START> i would strongly recommend this film for any musical fan whose been dying to see a musical make a faithful transition from stage to screen sure it's long but it's length is a testimony to how true to the original musical script the film is being the sets and cast really make sweet apple ohio the place to be fosse protege anne reinking also does a splendid job with choreography giving the dances a nice small town period feel br br the casting at a glance may look strange to some but they really are qute marvelous reading annonymous 's comments on jason alexander's performance made me sick in fact his perforamnce literally steals the show as albert he mixes his own unique blend of manic nervousness with dick van dyke esque charm to create a new and improved albert the fact that he can dance and sing like nobody's business doeesn't hurt either george wendt is another stand out who improves upon paul lynde's take on harry mcaffe by making him less manic and more down to earth and strict his whole character and body language scream over my dead body marc kudisch takes the elvis aspect of conrad birdie to new heights with his subtle insertion of a thank you very much in honestly sincere his physicality though harkens back more to young elvis then the bloated stubly conrad of the original film the fact is that this movie differs so greatly from the original film which added drawn in happpy faces turtles on speed and the russian ballet what did any of taht have to do with bye bye birdie i wonder the only possible advantage the original version has over this one is ann margret otherwise the update is better in every possible way where the old version cut many songs and increased dance breaks nwhere there was no need for them and for all intents and purposes ended the movie in the middle of the play the new version has restored the original music score and has added some great new stuff as well a giant step being the standout in that category we know live in trying times but if you want to get your mind off your troubles and put on a happy face then this is one worth checking out
<START> i remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to graceland it all came flooding back why this hasn't had a video or dvd release yet it's sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been in fact this is the one john carpenter film that hasn't been released in fact i haven't seen it on the tv either since the day i watched it kurt russell was the perfect choice for the role of elvis this is definitely a role he was born to play john carpenter's break from horror brought this gem that i'd love the tv to play again it is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes belting out most of elvis's greatest hits with gusto i think this also was the film that formed the partnership with russell and carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movies escape from new york the thing big trouble in little china and escape from l a someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has if this doesn't get released then we are gonna be in heartbreak hotel
<START> i saw this movie and at times i was unnerved believing this movie 'saw me ' munchie sullies the 'farce' for years to come re watch star wars don't watch munchie br br as a responsible parent i'm speaking to those who are parents now i you would not let my your child ever partake of this video festival of the pseudo occult to insinuate munchie is satanic to a co viewer is likely to illicit a chilled 'duh ' he is fiendish alien rodential and wholly malevolent like the bogey man made flesh invisible to adults tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford without the income made possible by years of self denial and prudent stewardship he is a peddler of easy answers and false ideals he is everything the morally conscious viewer is not he is the devil's own ron popeil br br i pray i mean this literally and figuratively with an emphasis on the former that this movie has not made the format jump to dvd it is my hope that this type of 'yellow film making' died an un mourned death in the cold nights of 1994 br br munchie also loves pizza i forgot to mention that it comes up a lot
<START> if you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty intoxicated you'll enjoy d war if you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action films you'll enjoy d war otherwise don't bother i saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends they really loved it and that made me feel good after the movie was over all the kids my nephews and their friends could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater br br the cg is good acting and directing are horrible storyline is extremely simple but since the half of the audience was kids they were screaming shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen this made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been br br it's a good movie to take your kids to but except for the final battle sequence d war is disappointing i give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much
<START> i am shocked shocked and dismayed that the 428 of you imdb users who voted before me have not given this film a rating of higher than 7 7 that's a c if i could give fobh a 20 i'd gladly do it this film ranks high atop the pantheon of modern comedy alongside half baked and mallrats as one of the most hilarious films of all time if you know anything about rap music you must see this if you know nothing about rap music learn something and then see this comparisons to 'spinal tap' fail to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film if you liked bob roberts you'll love this watch it and vote it a 10
<START> so where are the cannibals those intrigued by the title and the 'real cannibal' appeal of this film will be let down instead we are shown a strange man and his re visiting of a papua new guinea village full of natives one of whom was his lover several decades prior the man tobias schneebaum is new york jewish as they come and somehow this is intertwined with the documentary as he appears in his yamika in several scenes br br there are no real cannibals here only stories relayed by some of the natives and by tobias himself not all together a bad film very interesting and great cinematography schneebaum remains highly likable throughout and provides us with a fascinating glimpse into a life that is about as far removed from western civilization as one can get br br it's just not what it claims to be on the cover and in the plot summary br br 4 out of 10 kids
<START> this is arguably the best film director haim bouzaglo made until now a skilled tv director well trained in story telling and in directing his actors through long epics he tried to catch in this very low budget film the essence of the very special psychological situation the israelis live though under the permanent danger of the terror attacks resulting in 'distorted' lives each character trying to live his own life to watch and control the other while being himself watched and controlled by other characters and mostly by the continuous pressure by political and historical forces well beyond his control some call this destiny but destiny has a very concrete representation in this film br br there is no explicit political saying in 'distortion' characters never discuss politics not even at the level of saying 'bastards ' when they hear that a new terror attack happens their reaction to events is to localize the attack and to count the victims using the official and media terminology for the dead and the wounded they do not really live but rather survive on borrowed time happy to have survived one bomb and waiting for the next one to happen personal social professional life seems to work someway but is deeply flawed and influenced by events the main character played by the director is a playwright whose mid life personal and creative crisis is amplified by the pressure of the events and by the fact that he is lucky enough to leave a terror attack site minutes before the bomb explodes he hires a private detective to follow his girlfriend who is a tv investigative reporter whom he suspects is falling in for the subject of her next show another failed man former military whose business and family life dismantles under the events he starts to write a play that carbon copies the reality and will bring it to the stage in theater in film scene that reminds hamlet as well as 'synecdoche new york' it's not that i would dare suspect charlie kaufman looking over the shoulder of bouzaglo he certainly needs not that but the israeli director screen is brilliant into anticipating the later film and the first directed by kaufman as in the american film actors play real persons and start interacting with them in an reality meets stage meets reality melange which never lacks logic at least not artistic logic br br bouzaglo directs his actors with the usual talent trusts them and allows them the freedom of living through the situations rather then acting them his style is much more free here than in his tv series and the 'distortion' effects although borrowed from american horror movies work pretty well all over the ending seemed to me a little rhetorical and unsatisfying dramatically but the shade of the suicidal killer who is haunting the film and the whole situation in a temporal loop will also follow the viewer when remembering later this film
