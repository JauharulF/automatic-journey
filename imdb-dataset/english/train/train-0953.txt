<START> the only reason i rented this was because of the article in fangoria magazine the article made this film look interesting well it isn't this was a very boring amateurishly written and directed movie all the actors in this movie are awful except faye dunaway who is always a joy to watch but too much time was focused on gina phillips and her ridiculous encounters with ravens and duilio marzio marzio has such a thick argentinean accent you can only understand every couple of words he says also on hand is nicholas pauls who plays the ultra bland love interest to gina phillips the bottom line this movie is not scary there is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie i would have given this one star but i gave it three just because i like faye dunaway so much but even she wasn't that great in this
<START> i almost drowned in cheese watching this movie in fact i could not even finish it i want my money back one more of hollywood's feeble attempts to come up with a new idea good thing i keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge just in case they should of gave nic cage a hat and a bull whip swashbucklin' cage's performance in raising arizona or leaving las vegas beats this lemon people who are completely and totally marketed and most of them are should love this movie if this film had been animated i would have taken it more seriously i would of rather paid to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it in my opinion this was a incredibly stupid movie and it made a even more incredibly sad attempt to try and hide that fact br br all the sheep seem to love it though
<START> deliverance is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful 1970's decade from whence so many other exploitation films came br br a group of friends sets out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who pretty much try to ruin their lives it's awesome br br we are treated to anal rape vicious beatings bow and arrow killings shootings broken bones etc a lot like 1974's texas chainsaw massacre to say that deliverance is believable would be immature this would never and could never happen even in the dark ages of 1972 br br deliverance is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action it is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early 70's and it arguably sits on top of that pile with it's great acting superb cinematography and excellent writing br br 8 out of 10 kids
<START> this was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting mainly from the supporting characters the interview with hugh laurie on the dvd was actually more rewarding than the film itself br br hugh laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool the movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment br br if you have never seen rio or the inside of a british bank this film is for you 2 out of 10
<START> the h g wells classic has had several incarnations the 05' speilburg version and the classic 53' version but only this one stays completely true to the book nothing is changed nothing is removed br br originally released as a 3 hour film the director re cut the film down to 2 hours of pure excellence its got a chapter by chapter visualization of the novels pages that wells would be proud of the story is as everyone remembers martians invade the earth with capsules containing an army of tripod walking war machines the people of 19th century earth are ill prepared to repel the alien forces and fight back with canons and guns who mes shells bound right off the walkers and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of organisms on earth br br the film is an excellent accomplishment for director timothy hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a meager 5 million budget today b movies have larger budgets
<START> i'm in awe wow prepare to be blown away by the uncanny ways of the ninja watch them as they pounce crawl along the ground on their backs or stomachs like a caterpillar fly through the sky climb buildings hide and spring from trees throw about ninja stars role out blue welcome mats disappear in smoke bombs make a lot of swoosh noises with their blades and quickly sneaking or trotting about on their toes what a sight really i could go on about the many traditional actions but i'll be here all day oh not to forget we even get the legendary chuck connors popping up now and again and watch him dispatch some ninjas with his shotgun with little ease what class what a badass anyhow the ultra cheap 'sakura killers' is some stupid but cheesy ninja action fun that only fanatics of the genre would get anything out of this shonky b grade debacle br br a genetic lab in america has a very important video that's stolen by a couple of ninjas two americans are sent to japan by the colonel chuck connors to retrieve it br br the opening of the feature sets it up nicely get ready for the laughs afterwards it slows down but soon after the two main protagonists learns about the ninja and goes through the training it gets a head of steam as they break in costumes and fled after the stolen beta tape that contains a very important formula this is when the violently swift action and aerobic marital arts really come in to play it's not too shoddy either like the moronic script and daft performances the final climatic showdown is very well done br br in the slow stretches it has the two americans mike kelly and george nicholas looking in to the case sharing brainless conversations and encountering some minor problems what made me laugh was how the ninjas were put off by how brave and clever these two were these were supposed to be professional killers director dusty nelson 'effects 1989 ' does an earnest job with what he had and plays it for what it is he centres the on screen activities around striking taiwan locations the score is a chintzy arrangement
<START> as someone who has seen and followed hartley's public work for several years i think much of what used to be fiction told through true stories has been elevated into obscure philosophical mind games br br while entertaining fay grim is another step in the henry fool line of thinking where the movie reflects the quality of an object within the movie itself in henry fool the object is the memoirs in fay grim the object is encrypted memoirs which are themselves stolen forged and trans mutated into something so obscure it can't really make any sense i e the process of script writing and film making in the modern era where most blockbuster films are little more than a mash up of the past that is in a philosophical sense what fay grim is all about the object perhaps is the tragedy that shock is now clichÃ© and dull as hinted in the opening scenes at the publishers office br br that being said many of the movie best points are lost if you do not understand henry's character and the significance of the memoirs being looked for henry is a thinly veiled devil first visiting simon as a modern faust etc without understanding how tragic henry's character is much of the quality of fay grim's plot and story is lost br br and there is not enough 'detail' expressed through verbal flashbacks knowing the plot of henry fool cannot compare to 'feeling' the quality of the characters as one did in henry fool and so i think for someone who walks into this movie cold there is about 10 minutes of 'so what' responses to highly constructed dialog and then that's it br br however henry fool was also my least favorite hartley film until i realized that it was bad putrid and infested precisely because henry fool's confessions were bad not just raunchy or dirty but inescapably broken henry can not even be a proper villain and this is perhaps the tragic flaw that makes him most endearing like gollum in tolkien's works henry is pitiable br br that doesn't come across in fay grim although henry's dialog is excellent what does come across is that the entire movie is constructed as an encryption a sort of molding of another plot around what ends up being yet another bad story to add to henry's confessions it is an interesting twist but one that can't really be digested without viewing the first film perhaps showing more of henry earlier on would have been better than having the publisher describe the basic storyline of the first movie although this plot is also not really what the first movie was about unless perhaps one is a casual observer br br part of the encryption hard to say a little disappointed at the sex gimmicks though cheesy
<START> this movie with the alternate title martial law 3 for some reason introduced me to jeff wincott for the first time and it was a great introduction although i had never heard of him before he seemed to be an excellent fighter the action scenes in this movie are great there are lots of them too by the way the recruit fight at the peacekeepers hq is especially good there's just something about one single guy beating the crap out of a bunch of people that's really fun and for the rest of the cast brigitte nielsen was a good choice for the villain roles like this fits her but others don't matthias hues also did a good job as always he's a great fighter and macho like character and was a good rival for wincott in this movie
<START> this one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very short br br the opening match was a waste of the legion of doom but i guess the only way they could have been eliminated by demolition was a double dq otherwise mr perfect would have had to put in overtime kerry von erich the i c champ was wasted here and this was the third ppv in a row where perfect jobbed remember before that he never lost a match br br the second match was very good possibly the best of the night ted dibiase and the undertaker were excellent while the jim neidhart had one of his wwf highlights pinning the honky tonk man koko b ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel remember the big bossman and yokozuna this was a foreshadowing of bret hart's singles career as he came back from two on one and almost survived the match he and dibiase put on a wrestling clinic making us forget that the point of the match was dibiase's boring feud with dusty rhodes br br even though the visionaries were the first team to have all of its members survive and only the second since '87 to have four survivors this match was not a squash this was the longest match of the night and jake did a repeat of his '88 performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated i think he could have actually pulled off an upset these days the match would have ended the other way around br br one of the shortest ss matches ever was also one of its most surprising possibly the most underrated wrestler ever tito santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night putting on war paint and pinning boris zukhov tanaka and even the warlord in the final survival match it was so strange to see him put over so overwhelmingly then go right back to his mediocre career sgt slaughter also did well getting rid of volkoff and the bushwhackers but that just wasn't a surprise tito was br br i think the only point of the survival match was to have hogan and the warrior win together at the end br br this show was boring and the matches were too short the undertaker's debut was cool but tito santana is the reason i will remember this one
<START> i really enjoyed the detail that went into the script br br jonathan rhys myers misspelled and jewel were outstanding in their support roles as was jeffery wright toby mcguire gave as fine a acting job as ever depicted when he had to amputate his best friend's arm knowing he would die without the procedure br br attention to detail with good dialect coaching to catch the southern accent incredibly well br br why this movie was swept under the rug by the hollywood promoters i can only imagine i have strong suspicions which makes it all the more appealing to me i have given a dozen dvd copies out for presents br br completely overlooked movie rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours then judge
<START> i liked the first movie but this is a textbook example of a sequel that would have been better of left on the drawing board the general idea in the first movie was if not great then at least very interesting this sequel tries to build upon the idea and the characters from the first movie and though christopher walken is still good as gabriel the whole idea suddenly gets a bit ridiculous if you haven't seen any of these movies then get the first movie and forget about the sequels they can take away all of the joy from the original
<START> i had no idea what jane eyre was before i saw this miniseries i had read and watched many classics before and i believed that most classics were boring over worded and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots at best this jane eyre miniseries completely changed my conceptions br br zelah clarke is a fabulous actress and she gives a wonderful portrayal of jane eyre her accent is delightful and her quiet yet firm nature matches the young governess' character exactly timothy dalton is an amazing rochester his passion and energy in the film makes me believe that he was born to play the brooding master of thornfield hall i couldn't sleep at all the night after i had watched this miniseries the plot is both haunting and inspiring the characters are masterfully performed and the story is incredible this is the best version of jane eyre to ever appear on film br br i read the book later and was amazed at how closely this miniseries followed charolette bronte's writing jane eyre is now my favorite film and book if you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life watch the 1983 bbc version of jane eyre
<START> i could barely keep myself from either nodding off or just turning off this turd but i decided to stick it out if only for the reasoning that maybe something would happen this is the work of a writer producer director special fx kenneth herts who wants to make a statement on ecological damage while making a monster movie that's what he wanted anyway what it turns out to be is a lot of acting either slightly hammy or just mundane and without much merit and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster attacks in the river waters oh and what luck a woman just happens to be naked in it even though there have already been disappearances br br this is just nonsensical stuff but i suppose it's not too harmful it's not very obnoxious at the least and once or twice we get a semi interesting peek at brazilian culture which is the father walking through town with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of 'hey this is not america ' but whatever hope the director had in casting mitchum or carradine is squandered on at best pedestrian and at worst excruciatingly banal and dumb dialog it doesn't help that when we finally get something of a good look at the monster and the action happens it too is stupidly staged and with only sleazy appeal usually i would feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of problems getting a particular picture finished in this case it took the better part of the mid 70s but with monstroid or monster or whatever it's called nah br br if you happen to get the elvira dvd double feature of this bad print with bad transfer quality with blue sunshine make sure to skip this one unless of course you're an elvira die hard and can't help yourself to hear her luscious commentary personally i'd rather get joel or mike nelson with the robots from mystery science theater on this roast turkey
<START> dahmer is an interesting film although i wouldn't use horror or thriller do describe it it's more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer br br jeremy renner portrays serial killer jeffrey dahmer who drugged murdered and dismembered his male victims the film centers on the relationship between dahmer and rodney well played by artel kayÃ ru br br rodney is almost the more interesting character enamored of dahmer and having once escaped an attack he returns to dahmer for sex and survives a second attack br br i think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray dahmer's formative years how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into dahmer's belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims br br the roles are well played but the story is thin
<START> this is the worst movie i've ever seen in my life this is saying quite a bit considering some of the choices i've made in film rentals br br i got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone i went to high school with is topless in it the topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to roseanne sing big spender br br the skits are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker room gags and it's such a blatant and poor rip off of the kentucky fried movie that you'll be begging for big jim slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of vince offer whoever that is br br unless you are a masochist avoid this pile of rubbish
<START> second tier american leading man guy madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this spaghetti western Â which having very modest credentials emerges as essentially routine though featuring a nice enough score the plot offers some mild interest the title incidentally refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gun runners on a ranch Â the property of the family of their pursuer cavalry agent madison the latter's younger siblings are determined that the injured party now in their charge lead them to the gang boss responsible ultimately the identity of either mystery man proves a surprise Â and both ironically become involved with one of madison's sisters another is raped during the raid euro cult starlet rosalba neri appears unremarkably as a saloon hostess and madison's ex flame
<START> you know all those letters to father christmas and jesus that are sent every year well it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them as bizarre settings go it's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is dead letter office having said that this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one if it was royal mail most letters get this sort of treatment anyway i haven't been in this flat for two years and we're still getting letters for a mr wang some female priest of the church of latter day i've never heard of you and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company br br dead letter office the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up follows the story of alice miranda otto who grows up in a seriously divided home writing to her absent father she only learns in adulthood that her letters haven't been delivered for one reason or another so logically she gets a job at the d l o and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding chilean immigrant frank lopez george del hoyo slowly she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self contained world of the dead letters office to its knees br br nothing against this film but i was reminded of the god awful heather graham film committed while watching this however this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again that ain't difficult for a start this film is much more logical true the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel it is also well acted both otto and del hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they'll never find while other characters are peripheral at best part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed the other part is that when you consider australia's draconian immigration policy i e if you don't speak english rack off such a story is unlikely to take place in reality the other characters sadly also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd ball stereotypes br br despite that dead letter office is certainly something a little different it might not be to everyone's taste but i liked it yes it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes it's nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy duty swearing and nudity no chance of that in an australian film there ain't any major laughs there's no bullet time and the characters are usually one dimensional but it's the story that counts here and while it's not earth shattering in its magnificence it's a pleasant enough way of passing the time it's the movie equivalent of a sheryl crow cd nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn't really miss it if it wasn't there
<START> the movie celebrates life br br the world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has happy end just like in the closing scene of the movie br br the movie has wonderful soundtrack mixture of serbian neofolk gypsy music and jazz br br this movie is very refreshing piece of visual poetics br br the watching experience is like you've been sucked in another colorful romantic and sometimes rough world br br like mr kusturica movie should be
<START> i usually like zombie movies but this one was just plain bad br br the good parts girl swimming topless with thong bottoms sonya salomaa's topless and ona grauer's boobs jiggling in a skimpy top when she ran br br the bad part too much video cuts too much matrix slow motion it drags the action not enough blood and guts bad acting and no story the only other person in the theater was smart and left right after the topless swimming scene a total waste of 6 and time i give it a 2 out of 10
<START> dig i would say to anyone even if you don't like metallica to see 'some kind of monster' it is a spinal tap type documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world acting like mental kids during a breakdown of sorts it's fun and fascinating along the same lines comes dig a film about 'the dandy warhol's' and 'the brian jonestown massacre' two portland bands who start off a kind of music scene in there home town only for one of the bands to become huge and one to fall by the wayside into the musical history books right from the start the two bands pull in opposite directions just on their ability to make decisions whether good or bad filmed over seven years and at times painful to watch we see the dandy's meteoric rise to fame thanks to that vodaphone ad and the jonestown seminal fall from scene instigators to bickering wannabes as the bands become more disjointed the friendships are stretched tension tight and at several points snap into arguments and even on stage fights all of this is half funny and half tragic and believe it or not is perversely watch able like i said at the beginning you can watch the metallica film even if you have no interest in the band dig on the other hand is slightly different and is more enjoyable and a whole lot easier to watch if you have a passing interest in either band still a good film and more a testament to not be in a band than encouraging that as a career path dig is a mad ride on rock and roll's coat tails and a fine example of the pitfalls and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous
