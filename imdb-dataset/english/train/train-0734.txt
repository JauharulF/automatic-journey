<START> a recent post here by a woman claiming a military background contained the comment a woman's life is no more valuable than a man's br br this mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population sometimes with astonishing speed germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed in south america's war of the triple alliance 1865 paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 chaco war against much larger bolivia br br no society however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its defense forces despite the popular image of the israeli girl soldier br br g i jane is hollywood fluff
<START> arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons a good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away if you look fast you can see frank graham during the restaurant scene in the background while dudley moore and jill eikenberry are in conversation frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him br br secondly though i actually knew a real life arthur bach he was not quite as wealthy as arthur but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid his parents tightly controlled his purse strings but his rent and utilities were paid for in a basement apartment in greenwich village he spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself just like dudley moore does br br the wonder with arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not but that's the other half of the equation my friend was a most charming person when you got to know him in fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming he couldn't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the vendor he spent his life being a perfect party guest the term wastrel which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to him br br and that's what dudley moore is a wastrel unlike my friend moore has john gielgud to clean up after him that's a full time job as we see demonstrated in arthur my friend also never found a liza minnelli a male liza minnelli in fact because he was gay still moore's portrayal of arthur bach is deadly accurate and so real for me br br arthur 20th century wastrel is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in jill eikenberry since he won't work for a living the threat of being cut off is quite real for him he only has his butler hobson played by john gielgud and chauffeur bitterman played by ted post to pour his troubles out to we should all have such troubles br br john gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in arthur on film and in fact gielgud is more prominently known for his stage performances yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at oscar time the academy gave henry fonda and katharine hepburn oscars for on golden pond and gielgud the best supporting actor award essentially for the work of a lifetime that man was amazing still at his craft almost to the end br br so to frank graham who worked in the film and to jackie weiss a genuine real life arthur i dedicate this review
<START> this film takes you on one family's impossible journey and makes you feel every step of their odyssey beautifully acted and photographed heartbreakingly real its last line with its wistful hope is one of the more powerful in memory
<START> it's actually a good thing sean connery retired as james bond as i'm sure he wouldn't be able to keep up in the nowadays spying business where fast cars have been replaced with hi tech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment cypher is a pretty inventive sci fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible you know the trend in these types of movies nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again the events in cypher supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world where the major companies don't really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other's thunder company digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor the sunways corporation sunways on the other hand constantly tries to unmask the digisoft rats and recruit them again as double spies in between this whole unprofitable business stands morgan sullivan a seemingly colorless thirty something employee who's been selected by sebastian rooks the Ã¼ber spy to diddle the secret policies of both companies trust me it's actually less complicated than it sounds and director vincenzo natali the dude from tube carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters the first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated john frankenheimer gem seconds Â starring rock hudson Â as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that 60's film with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless there's also plenty of great action and suspense most notably when morgan soberly experiences how the digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashing techniques during boring conventions the middle section of the film drags a little mainly because you already realize that it's all just building up towards multiple misleading plot twists and i hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the not so distant future jeremy northam is perfectly cast and the adorable lucy liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side regular director's choice david hewlett has the most memorable supportive role as the uncannily eccentric suways engineer virgil c dunn cypher is well made and adrenalin rushing sci fi entertainment highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time
<START> a struggling actor finds the best way to break into hollywood is to start knocking off the competition but what makes break a leg a real gem is the sardonic look into the existence of the struggling and not so la actor it brings us into that world with effortless irony and wit it's also got a polished look and very adept direction under monika mitchell break a leg is one of those rare independent films that doesn't compromise its production values at any level the writing is tight the dialogue first rate cassini is an actor's actor and the role really shows off his talents the climactic scene between him and rene garcia is an instant classic and may go down as one of the funniest hollywood scenes of all time i saw it at an advanced screening and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards
<START> this is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in wwii and in history of warfare behind the front line bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event there is no character development at all and idea that tom cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane i believe that mister bin would play it better generally speaking film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good german tv movie stauffenberg from 2004 but can't get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever however movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop corn audience that cherishes hollywood fast mood blood and shallow art values
<START> mix exotic tropical locations babes in skimpy attire explosions good looking dudley do right clones a movie star with his best years behind him martin sheen a little martial arts and a sexy villainess tracy lor er sorry tracy elizabeth lords and you'd think you'd be in for some escapist fun not so this is a dreary tv movie and even though it likes to promote itself as a charlie's angels deal it is nowhere near as good as the original series or even the gawdawful irretrievably stupid recent c a movies this abomination is best described as a third rate andy sidaris film nowhere near as much fun as andy's hard ticket to hawaii although some of the fight scenes are decent enough the girls spend too much time posing and trying too look prissy and it gets annoying after a while there's better genre stuff that this out there oh yeah and the babes aren't as hot as they like to think they are terrible soundtrack when it's there
<START> i'm among millions who consider themselves cary grant fans but i can't think of a single reason to recommend this movie i don't understand the casting of betsy drake and it appears no one else did if we're to judge from the small number of films in which she played afterwards br br most fans will agree that katharine hepburn was superb at chasing and catching cary grant in bringing up baby here the director or writers try to rehash the idea but it fails miserably i've read comments about how creepy drake was but i thought that was far too mild a description franchot tone walked through this one as if he were hungover a casting disaster is one thing this film is a total disaster br br this one doesn't deserve 10 lines of comments and i don't know why that's a requirement too bad this one was preserved when so many worthwhile films lie rotting in vaults br br unless you want to torture someone give this one a wide berth
<START> here's the kind of love story that i do enjoy watching and mostly it's for two reasons one it concentrates of young people very young people people who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time or at least think they are all of us have been there in our lives and the man in the moon is a magnificent reflection upon our memories maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced the second reason is that is a love triangle and i do believe that as teens it's the most dramatic and the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs will believe it for the rest of their lives br br the cast of the man in the moon is full of great talented names it stars sam waterston who is truly a versatile actor well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict yet caring and wise fathers as in this film also there is tess harper jason london and a young young reese witherspoon you look at the young talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road she's going to win the academy award all members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations as if it all really happened this the kind of movie that i would like to see come out more often love story or not i would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way
<START> i probably give this more credit than it deserves because it's halloween i was just at knott's scary farm and i was in a mood to watch a really cheesy halloween movie br br oh and it only cost me one dollar br br usually i'll ffwd through a movie like this to get to the good stuff but i resisted the urge here and i'm still not sure why it was obvious from the opening shots this wasn't a real movie not even a b movie it's more in the category of the decoteau horror movies like the brotherhood that are shot on film look video for about 50 cents in fact i was half afraid any minute one of his beefy college boys would stagger out rubbing himself in his underpants or something there were no cutaway shots too expensive to do multiple camera setups and flat lighting but it's hard to pinpoint there's something refreshing about watching a director with no money pull off a half decent movie the fact that he's doing even a half decent job is commendable and this movie has it's share of merits the acting isn't bad the photography is pretty good if too bright to be scary there are some surprises and the whole thing is sort of different somehow br br a bunch of college kids are for some unknown reason stuck in the warehouse where they are decorating the annual haunted house a creepy old man gives them a satanic book and they accidentally summon up the powers of hell this results in the costumed people in the haunted house becoming who they are made up to be and causing a lot of mayhem and human suffering along the way we are treated to an oddly complex and thoughtful lesbian relationship subplot it's interesting that this couple seems to be the most well rounded in the movie yes there's a sex scene but it isn't salacious or at least no more so than you'd find in any legit movie about lesbians that shows them having sex it's rather unusual for a horror film to take the time and effort to do this without resorting to cheap exploitation br br the other thing about this that held my interest was how it was clearly trying to emulate the stupid kids have sex and get killed vibe of the 80's slashers it's hard to take that on because there are so many of those films that already exist the genre has been done to death i'm not sure if it's good or bad that these filmmakers simply tried to make another entry in that genre without irony as if it was still a living genre but i appreciated the attempt br br which is why i sat through it sometimes you just want to watch a mindless no budget a for effort horror film there really was too much set up not enough gore endless plot holes dead ends and clichÃ©s and the unfortunate overall feel of a movie that simply did not have enough money behind it to be the film the producers envisioned but at the very least the haunted house scenes were pretty cool i'd pay to go to that haunted house if it existed and didn't mind paying a dollar to see it on dvd even if i'll never watch this again br br oh and possible spoiler but there was great brief business with the vampire girl in the coffin i used to be claustrophobic but i've changed ha ha good one
<START> i'm always surprised about how many times you'll see something about world war 2 on the german national television you would think they don't like to open old wounds but there isn't a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war perhaps it's a way of dealing with their past i don't know but you sure can't blame them of ignoring what happened and it has to be said most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies think for instance about der untergang or the downfall as you might now it which are also very realistic br br one of those movies is rosenstrasse it tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war even though the movie starts with a family in the usa at the present day after hannah's father died her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox jew even though she hasn't been very religious before she doesn't know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from but as she starts digging in her mother's troubled childhood hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mother's past br br the fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the nazi regime is already quite surprising for as far as i know there hasn't been another movie that deals with this subject for those who didn't know this yet being married to a so called pure aryian man or woman meant for many jews that they weren't immediately sent to one of the concentration camps but that they had to work in a factory but it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives how difficult it sometimes was for them during the nazi regime and how these people most of the time women did everything within their power to free their men once they were captured and locked away in for instance the rosenstrasse br br the acting is really good and the story is very well written although the way it was presented in the beginning didn't really do it for me and that's exactly the only part that you'll get to see in the trailer perhaps it's just me but i would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day at least of the part that is situated in the usa because the part where hannah goes to berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mother's past definitely works br br if you are interested in everything that has something to do with the second world war and if you aren't necessarily looking for a lot of action shots than this is definitely a movie you should see this isn't a movie in which you'll see any battles or gunfights but it certainly is an interesting movie because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of i give it an 8 10
<START> despite pretty bad reviews i just had to give this film a go Â it does after all star hk super babe shu qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all action cat burglars surely that's worth checking out well as babe fests go martial angels is hard to beat the eye candy is top quality shu qi looks as fantastic as always and of the rest of the girls rosemary vandebrouck and amanda strang caught my roving eye in particular br br unfortunately if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits it is an absolute stinker the story is weak the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic director clarence fok and producer wong jing have given us a photogenic cast and little else br br if shu qi is the only reason you're contemplating seeing this one you would be better off watching sex and zen 2 again
<START> this movie serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can both write and direct their own movie face it you can't because that way there's nobody around to tell you when you hack great holes in your plot have meaningless transitions trite unmemorable dialog and manage to turn a fairly cool korean legend into a steaming pile of celluloid turd br br i wanted to like this movie as a trashy popcorn movie really i did i like lots of crappy movies but once i've been forced to ask myself what the hell just happened and why dear lord why more than a few times i really can't take it any more br br also i would love for someone to explain how la became mordor for the last scene
<START> perhaps disney was hoping for another mary poppins but this is a very different story and while angela is delightful she was a very different performer to the great julie andrews having said that lansbury is perfectly cast and delivers a magical performance there is something deliciously dotty about her character and she is given wonderful support by david tomlinson tomilinson can carry a tune but he is certainly not much chop as a singer it does not matter he was such a gifted actor you hardly notice there are some great cameos from much loved stars of another time like roddy mcdowel who gives a winning performance and the much loved tessie oshea who does very little but its nice to see the old gal again its also lovely to see sam jaffe and the king of english television bruce forsythe in small roles the score has a couple of beautiful songs especially the briny sea and the age of not believing the big number portabello road is stretched to the limit but it has plenty of theatricality the effects look a bit clichÃ© today but the scene with the german invaders being attacked by the wildest army in film is pretty impressive the kids are not as annoying as other movies but one does struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying i loved the marching song of the home army the home guard were very important to britain and this is a warm tribute the animation is delightful much better than pixar which i find grotesque a warm happy film and its a wonder its not done on stage
<START> don't drink the cool aid br br this is an opinion piece disguised as a documentary and to title it as a truth is just plain crap the debate over global warming is far from over and will only be over when the eco zombies start acknowledging the mountain of evidence contrary to their beloved theory just google global warming and hoax or junk science and you will find a river of information refuting nearly every link in the chain of logic that gore sites the reason it is so important for people to educate themselves is the disastrous economic impact that global warming prevention measures would have wake up people anyone with a computer a little time and some common sense can find many many reasons why this theory is not even close to credible don't just read articles that support your present opinions read everything you can find there is no in depth analysis to make really there is simply too many alternate possibilities and counter evidence for the theory to have even the most basic level of scientific credibility it is so uncredible in fact that it may be the single biggest hoax in the course of human existence it's time for people to start speaking out against this kind of propaganda and it's time for people to admit to themselves and others that you can be a both a conservationist and recognize the glaring conclusion that global warming hysteria is a big lie
<START> i scooped up this title by accident with the grindhouse vol 1 collection of pure euro trash movies but this movie has a nice stamp of approval and should deserve a better transfer than what is out there stupednous it is not satisfying it is watching this movie i couldn't help to wonder how come sergio martino didn't make this flick this has his signature all over it and punctuated by edwedge fenech alas not as well known as she should be but she did get a nice cameo in hostel ii double crosses and triple crosses underly and cement this film from beginning to end with lee van cleef oozing coolness under pressure from the 1st second did this guy have to go to italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system let this guy slip through besides lee's more recognizable films film goers should try this on for size and see how if sergio leone would've lowered his epic scale down on once upon a time in america to half the running time and 1 4 of the budget this is what it would've turned out to be like so refreshing it should be taken in during the day at home and make it for an couch matinÃ©e
<START> this 1970 hit film has not aged well but frankly it was not that good when it was released yet it was a hugely popular success perhaps because the idea of fatalistic young love must have appealed to audiences saturated by constant tv coverage of the vietnam war the plot is pure drivel as it concerns oliver barrett iv a privileged harvard hockey player who meets and falls in love with jenny cavelleri an antagonistic vassar music student proud of her working class background his old school father naturally disapproves of jenny and in a typical act of rebellion that means the young couple gets married in one of those hippie era extemporaneous ceremonies he lands his dream job in new york but she gets unexpectedly ill and dies of her terminal disease there is a veneer of then contemporary film making techniques displayed by director arthur hiller but none of that can hide the old fashioned clichÃ© ridden story at its core the inevitable ending left me particularly unmoved br br both ryan o'neal and ali macgraw became stars with this movie as oliver and jenny but inexplicably so since neither seems able to convey the depth or complexity required to make their characters compelling at least the boyish o'neal is sincere in his weakly defiant approach but macgraw is so wooden and smirky in behavior that it's hard to see what oliver sees in jenny beyond her sarcastic faÃ§ade john marley two years before finding the decapitated racehorse in his bed in the godfather does better as jenny's plainspoken baker father phil as does ray milland as the seemingly insensitive barrett paterfamilias the overly familiar frances lai music has almost become parody in itself over the years the print quality on the dvd is good though the only extra is a rather effusive commentary track by hiller the most interesting bit of trivia is that author erich segal upon whose book this movie is based conceived oliver as a mix between two harvard roommates he knew Â vice president al gore and actor tommy lee jones who happens to have a bit part in the movie as one of oliver's roommates
<START> i really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie this movie was not intended to be a deep thought movie which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be in fact it would appear that if any movie doesn't produce a life altering insight and a deep twisted mind boggling plot they would rate it a 1 or 2 don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre people br br this movie was an action comedy flick and that's all it was intended to be and for an action comedy it was very well done i was actually rather surprised that i enjoyed it as much as i did having never really been a jamie foxx fan and having the over used plot that it has br br the plot was nothing spectacular using the typical criminal gets out of prison and is thrown into bad guy plot while trying to clean up his act see blue streak hudson hawk 48 hours etc etc etc but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist now the bad guys are actually the good guys and the real bad guy is an uber geek br br jamie foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film br br if you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in the matrix or a drama such as of mice and men then this movie isn't for you but if you enjoy the raw action excellent fast paced filming and an occasional twist of humor tossed in this movie won't disappoint you i would normally have rated it about an 8 on the same level as the die hard trilogy but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it should be br br
<START> horrible waste of time bad acting plot directing this is the most boring movie ever there are bad movies that are fun freddy vs jason and there are bad movies that are horrible this one fits into the latter bottom line don't waste your time
<START> steely powerful gangster supreme frankie diomede the always terrific lee van cleef in fine rugged form has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a traitorous partner sans detection fawning goofball small time hood and wiseguy wannabe tony breda an amiable portrayal by tony lo bianco gets busted as well frank and tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars tony helps frank break out of the joint and assists him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of mobsters lead by the ruthless louis annunziata smoothly played by jean rochefort director michele lupo working from an absorbing script by sergio donati and luciano vincenzoni relates the neat story at a constant brisk pace sustains a suitably gritty but occasionally lighthearted tone throughout and stages the rousing action set pieces with considerable rip snorting brio a rough'n'tumble jailhouse shower brawl and a protracted mondo destructo car chase rate as the definite thrilling highlights van cleef and lo bianco display a nice loose and engaging on screen chemistry the relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touching the ravishing edwige fenech alas isn't given much to do as tony's whiny girlfriend orchidea but at least gets to bare her insanely gorgeous and voluptuous body in a much appreciated gratuitous nude shower scene riz ortolani's groovy pulsating syncopated funk jazz score certainly hits the soulfully swingin' spot the polished cinematography by joe d'amato and aldo tonti is likewise impressive a really nifty and entertaining little winner
