<START> red skelton was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with ease br br his shows certainly brought a laughter to the american households of years back br br he would begin the show with an opening monologue afterwards we would have a variety of characters remember gertrude and heathcliff in the monologue how can we ever forget san fernando red i remember one episode where as a king red introduced his queen by referring to her as your fatness br br go know that red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life he lost a son to leukemia at age 11 or so his wife georgia died by suicide
<START> i really enjoyed this movie as a young kid at that age i thought that the silly baseball antics were funny and that the movie was cool because of it's about sports now several years later i can look back and see what a well designed movie this was this movie opened my eyes as a small child to the struggles other children dealt with and real world issues that kind of exposure is largely lacking in kids movies these days which i don't think is to our society's benefit sure the baseball antics seem really dumb now but they drew kids in no seven year old is going to ask to see a movie about foster children but they will ask to see a movie about baseball disney realized this fact and took advantage of it to teach these children an important lesson about the world br br as a young adult the performance of al and the other angels seems far less impressive however i will give credit to the actors playing both children and danny glover who all did a fantastic job
<START> the only reason i dvrd this movie was because 1 i live in cleveland and shaq plays basketball for us now and 2 i've always heard how awful it was the movie did not disappoint the best parts were shaq's outfits the worst parts were well just about everything else my 12 year old son and i just squirmed and couldn't look at the screen when shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why max didn't wish for kazzam to fix that front tooth of his but for all it's terribleness we just couldn't stop watching it the story sucked you in like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit it was hypnotic but it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched kazzam
<START> some people say steve irwin's larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act watch this film it's obvious he can't act br br steve irwin dangerman star of the small screen in his crocodile hunter diaries croc files and eponymous crocodile hunter series you see a naming trend here or is it just me rockets his larger than strife persona to the big screen with crocodile hunter collision course yup Â there's a definite trend of words beginning with 'c' basically an episode of crocodile hunter mashed together with a b movie br br on a mission to relocate a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer magda szubanski steve and wife terri are unaware that the croc is being tracked by american spies lachy hulme and kenneth ransom out to recover a spy satellite beacon it has swallowed will it hurt my credibility to say they're on a collision course with wackiness what credibility ed note br br the plot is irrelevant as it is steve's animal magnetism that propels the film if you find his persona trying the film is a failure but if you're a fan of either him as a businessman conservationist or just plain ass klown or his television shows expect more of the same on a wide screen budget br br john stainton faithful liege best mate and helmer of the crocodile hunter oeuvre can it be called that with a straight face writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made steve a household wildlife jester br br the most jarring aspect of this movie is that steve one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks and terri steve's spouse of 10 years fiercest ally and closest friend treat it like it is one of their documentaries breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the camera whilst all the other characters behave as if they're in a bad movie wellÂ it wouldn't be so incongruous if steve and terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters Â but when the bad americans constantly threaten steve's life we confused viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew doesn't at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics or run screaming into the bush Â anything but continue filming casually with great lighting crisp audio and seven action angles br br while terri is unfairly painted as steve's mildly incompetent sidekick her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pear shaped buttock hugging jeans for the last i'm not complaining steve goes about his business as usual of show and tell with creatures intent on killing him doing all his stunts himself because well to him they're not really stunts just a day at the office br br of course watching this madman's koo koo adventures after his tragic death in september 2006 casts a strange detachment over the proceedings but to those of us who never met him this kind of malarkey as well as various incarnations of the crocodile hunter series in constant re runs keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows the wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him and i truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprintsÂ br br so enjoy this diversion for what it is Â a half baked movie featuring a full on legend he died doing what he loved Â interacting with wildlife and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just that br br movie maniacs visit poffysmoviemania com
<START> going for something far away from the deliberately gross stuff that he usually makes john waters happy birthday john made this parody of the celebrity art world edward furlong plays the title character a working class teenager in baltimore who loves to photograph things when a new york agent lili taylor discovers his work she offers him his big break which he accepts but once he hits it big he has to reconsider everything br br basically pecker looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life once he becomes a celebrity the sort of thing that we might expect sure but with waters directing there's always a few things to shock us you'll know them when you see them i certainly recommend it also starring christina ricci mink stole and patty hearst
<START> shocking well made chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forces br br small town doctor tries to discover who or what is committing a series of violent sexual murders br br incubus is a tight mystery with some horrific murder sequences that builds to an off beat and eerie climatic twist the murder scenes are intense and gory so this isn't a film for the squeamish the direction of john hough along with a bizarre music score combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film it also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight br br the cast isn't bad either the great john cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town also good are the performances of kerrie keane as the local reporter helen hughes as the town historian and duncan mcintosh as a tormented psychic teen br br all around incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re discovered and re evaluated br br out of
<START> predictable plot simple dialogue shockingly unemotional performances but robert downey jr is so cute i gave this poor man's afternoon special a 3 instead of the 1 or 2 it so richly deserved
<START> this is one of those westerns that well stands practically alone in the unrelieved quality of its dialog very few can hold up to it over the long haul that said the rest is pretty bad nevertheless i am giving it an eight because there is no other western with such consistently good dialog with maybe the exception of the wild bunch junior bonner and perhaps a few more br br it is riddled with weaknesses john drew barrimore the most glaring however it does have one truly memorable scene nothing like it its right after kid wichita kills the sheriff and goes to jack elams place trying to goad him into a fight wonderful stuff right up with the best in any western
<START> the king is dead long live the king the triad of caddie shack two the family underneath the stairs and troop beverly hills had been tied for worst movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right but there is a new king yep all hail the new king down to earth but some things like tiny tim for example are so bad they are good some day this could take out the inimitable rocky horror picture show as a cult film so go see this this well just take my word for it go see it all hail the new king
<START> it's a very good movie not only for the fans of lady death comics but also for those who like animated movies series of adventure and fantasy br br the film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn't done but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell lucifer himself br br then she seeks revenge and the rest you better see it from the movie br br i liked the movie a lot the characters are like the original comics form chaos i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics only the last ones after the passages in the movie so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics but one way or another it's the story of lady death
<START> other than susan hayward's wooden delivery throughout this film it was as good as any biblical film made henry king handles this film with the respect of an epic in all of the small scenes and peck is as always impeccable the stirring alfred newman sound score with the stirring twenty third psalm is unforgettable even after these many years the scene with goliath is a bit on the hokey side but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made this goes well alongside the lesser bible epics of the day the song of ruth and esther and the king it is worth watching and raymond massy is excellent as the prophet nathan the film is rounded out by the always fine james robertson justice as abishai and jayne meadows as michol david's estranged first wife
<START> this film was the recipient of the 1990 academy award for best animated short film over the last few weeks i have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this award from the last 30 years and i really think that this film might just be the worst of them all yet it wasn't just a nominee but it won i assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre br br the film shows a group of characters that look a bit like super skinny uncle festers the appear to be simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation all are identical with the same faces bodies and clothes the only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs they are all standing on a large platform that is suspended as if by magic in space each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform the platform begins tilting slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform this goes on and on and on and on for the longest time the only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end but it just isn't enough to make this fun to watch in the least aside from passable stop motion animation this short offers nothing of interest to me nothing br br by the way the great short knick knack also came out in 1989 and i have no idea why it was not among the nominees it was a great short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before perhaps pixar's success in previous years resulted in a bias against them but knick knack is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it could pixar have not entered it this seems unlikely
<START> when this film was made the hippie thing had gone mainstream the ideas of the counter culture was well established that is why such a big film could be made yet it has something to say and it is said really beautifully apart from those who're only waiting for the wanking material this film is given credit for its beautiful scenes which in itself is more than enough reason to see the film by the most the soundtrack to this film which actually became more popular than the film itself is another plus pink floyd's careful with that axe eugene suits really well with the explosions the absence of music in other scenes gives the film a nice quiet mood but it seems as though the messages in this film have been overlooked by the most if you didn't understand it which seems to be the case for the most i'll give you some hints the man tough guy what ever his name is mark is a part of a reality group he leaves this group saying something like i'm willing to die but not of boredom he later go for a joyride with a stolen plane probably to seek some action as he is in the air grateful dead's dark star from the live dead album is played i think this song contains the phrase shall we go you and i while we can this is though not heard in the film perhaps stretching it a bit too far meaning that quote is essential in the plane he checks up a girl daria who is driving in her car to a conference about giving typical suburban families the opportunity to live in a super relaxing place in the desert where everything is so simple and nice for the whole family by diving down almost hitting the car he lands the plane and joins the girl on her way to detroit they stop at zabriskie point where they enjoy each other as living creatures and the nature later a family with a big car of the type which you sleep in and a speed boat is showed visiting zabriskie point the father saying something like what a waste driving all the way up here and the kid sitting inside the car grinning i sensed a this wasn't much better than on the telly attitude daria takes mark back to the plane which now is painted in a psychedelic style with the identity number changed to no war on one side and no words on the other bucks sucks is also written on the plane mark takes the plane back to where he stole it from saying to daria before he leaves i don't risk anything or something one of several hints about he not caring too much about his destiny this because he has the feeling that the environment that surrounds don't give him anything i wonder what happens in the real world on the airport he is met by police officers who shoots him even though he just has returned the plane daria hears this on the radio but decides to go to the conference in the fancy mansion here she feels alien after the adventures with her just killed friend she enjoys fresh water running down a rock more than the swimming pool inside the house the viewer is once again given a hint about anti materialism she looks out through a glass wall holding her hands on the glass like she was trapped the business men is seen arguing the one side eager to make a big deal the other afraid of losing money daria leaves the house and looks back at it visualizing it blowing up after the house several other things blow up for example a television she smiles happy she has inside herself destroyed what she after the meeting with mark look upon as something negative br br to summarize mark obviously experience the reality group as not very useful as they just sit and talk taking no action he clearly has bad feelings about things being as they are and it seems like he feels that it's no use fighting against it he wants to leave he helps daria who is in mind but not in action seeing his point of view where his feeling of being misfitted turns out leading to his death one can hope daria uses the ideas in a way that will turn out more constructive in the film you see how a town la is being polluted by commercial too bad you have to show the commercial to make the point you see business men deciding what is the future et cetera and you see people being unhappy with these and other situations which is parts of the modern world br br i have only seen the film once so i have not caught all points but i certainly got a feeling of what this film has to say and i find it strange that this film can be called meaningless if you say the points are being too obvious i can see why this film probably intended to appeal to the post hippie radicals digging the thoughts of anti establishment even though it has a lot to say and its message is still needed today things pretty much evolving in the same direction as it did before the sixties zabriskie point is a really great film telling a story about quite normal young people not far out hippies tripping around tip toe on acid digging everything seeking what they percept as real dissatisfied with the conventional and it is done in a truly beautiful way
<START> the movie is plain bad simply awful the string of bad movies from bollywood has no end they must be running out of excuses for making such awful movies or not br br the problem seems to be with mainly the directors this movie has 2 good actors who have proved in the past that the have the ability to deliver great performance but they were directed so poorly the poor script did not help either br br this movie has plenty of ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half for instance br br after his 1st big concert ajay devgan meets up with om puri from whom he ran away some 30 years ago and talked to again and all om puri finds to say is to beware of his friendship with salman what a load of crap seriously not to mention the baaad soundtrack whatever happened to shankar ehsaan loy br br ajay devgun is total miscast for portraying a rockstar br br only saving grace are the good performances in the second half ajay shines as his character shows his dark side so does salman as the drug addict br br watch it maybe only for the last half hour
<START> another entertaining travolta dance flick great music mood and scenes debra winger is beautiful like saturday night fever this macho film features extremely improbable scenes of beautiful women falling for travolta and almost begging him to have sex with them
<START> while being one of the stars of this film doesn't necessarily give me sage insight i do know quite a bit of what was first there and what ended up on the screen i remember seeing the original cut of incoming freshman and being very pleased it was funny sexy raunchy all the main requirements of a drive in film you have to remember this was shot and released before all the rest animal house porky's etc so in its own way this flick was truly ahead of its time for whatever reasons the film was given to the main distributors who editing out half the original film and then edited in should i say shuffled the most random scenes ever the fat guy the people with goat heads what the heck was all that i'm sure it was put in for additional t a but it was so slowly paced it caused anything going on prior to it to grind to a screeching and painful halt but all in all it's a fun memory for me especially in that i'm able to say that the worst movie i've ever seen i'm in
<START> i think we all begin a lot of reviews with this could've made a great movie a demented ex con freshly sprung a tidy suburban family his target revenge retribution manipulation marty's usual laying on of the karo syrup but unfortunately somewhere in universal's high rise a memorandum came down everyone ham it up br br nolte only speaks with eyebrows raised lange bitches her way through cigarettes lewis ohmagod's her way though her scenes and bobby d well he's on a whole other magic carpet affecting some sort of cajun huckleberry hound accent hybrid he chomps fat cigars and cackles at random atrocities such as problem child and i want you to imagine the accent mentioned above now imagine it spouting brain clanging religious rhetoric at top volume like he swallowed six bibles and you have de niro's schtick here most distracting of all though is his most overdone use of the de niro face he's so lampooned for eyes squinting forehead crinkled lips curled crimany bob you looked like plastic man br br the story apparently began off screen 14 years earlier when nolte was unable to spare de niro time in the bighouse for various assaults upon release he feels nolte's misrep of him back then warrants the terrorizing of he and his kin and we're supposed to give de niro's character a slight pass because nolte withheld information that might've shortened his sentence de niro being one of these criminals who despite being guilty of unspeakable acts feels his lack of freedom justifies continuing such acts on the outside mmm kay br br he goes after notle's near mistress in a scene some may want to turn away from his wife his daughter the family dog ya know which is one of the shortcomings of wesley strick's screenplay utter predictability as each of de niro's harassments becomes more gruesome you can pretty much call the rest of the action before it happens strick isn't to be totally discredited as he manages a few compelling dialogue driven moments de niro and lewis' seedy exchange in an empty theater is the film's best scene but mostly it's all over cranked scorsese's cartoonish photographic approach comes off as forced not to mention the horribly outdated re worked bernard hermann score i kept waiting for the wolf man to show up with a genetically enlarged tarantula br br thus we arrive at the comedic portion of the flick unintentionally comedic that is you know those scenes where something graphically horrific is happening but you can't help but snicker out of sight of others you'll do it here nolte and lange squawking about infidelity de niro's thumb flirting he cross dressing and a kitchen slip on a certain substance that has to be seen to believed and bob's infernal incessant constant mind damaging no end in sight blowhard ramblings of all the philosophy he disovered in prison i wanted him killed to shut him up more than to save this annoying family br br i always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers but here it's necessary this really is scorsese's version of freddy krueger the manner in which de niro relishes speaks stalks withstands pain right down to his one liners is vintage freddy upon being scalded by a pot of thrown water you trying' to offer sumpin' hot please and that's just one example br br unless you were a fan of the original 1962 flick and want a thrill out of seeing balsam peck and mitchum nearly 30 years later or want a serious head shaking film experience avoid a trip to the cape
<START> the film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads 'kushiata kyoto japan 1840' a young japanese trainee samurai named masanori toshiya maruyama walks up the winding path to the house inside waits otami mako hattori with whom he is having an affair behind her husband shugoro's tsuiyuki sasaki as toshiyuki sasaki back who happens to be masanori's teacher shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other his honour destroyed the enraged samurai brutally murders both otami and masanori before committing suicide over a century later and ted fletcher edward albert arrives in japan on a working holiday with his wife laura susan george and their young daughter amy amy barrett their close friend alex curtis doug mcclure who works for the american consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay you don't need me to you where he jokingly says it's going so cheap because it's haunted to which both ted and laura laugh off as they obviously don't believe in ghosts at least for the time being that is almost immediately the film goes into clichÃ© mode lights turn on and off by themselves laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local zen monk henry mitowa gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it's too late which they ignore of course the spirits of otami masanori and shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a majyo witches tsuyako olajima curse put upon them but there may be a way they can break the curse unfortunately for the fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage daughter and possibly even their very lives br br directed by kevin connor i thought this was a pretty average film ok to watch once if you've got nothing better to do but after a day or two you'll probably have completely forgotten it nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there's nothing particularly good about the film either the script by robert suhosky from the novel by james hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by the numbers a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn't help things there are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get amy and her babysitter noriko mayumi umeda and there is a scene where the zen monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in however that is until ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in some exorcism one more thing i think it was a bad idea to have doug mcclure who was 47 when he made this try his hand at kung fu and oriental sword fighting george gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with mcclure although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there's no blood gore or violence to speak about the 'transparent' ghost effects are ok but they ain't going to impress many people these days it's professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in america england or any western country without having to change a thing an ok time waster
<START> finally the uncut version of baby face surfaces and from what source the library of congress the restored four minutes snippets here and there make for a much better film we now know that baby face was pimped by her old man from the time she was at least fourteen years of age another reason d'tat for her behavior and cold calculating exterior br br barbara stanwyck is indeed amazing in the role of lily powers notice the moniker a part that called for just the right amount of sexuality coated with power cunning and revenge yet tinged with virginal pretense when called for a very difficult portrayal to make convincing barbara stanwyck conveys the necessary nuances to show that though she sleeps her way to the top literally she still has good in her heart note the way she treats those few who have been kind to her such as chico the marvelous actress theresa harris and the old philosopher and though she exploits her sexuality to make mush of men who are rich and powerful those same men are attempting to exploit her for their carnal desires with no intention of permanent ties until they fall in love with her br br lily powers fails to understand at first that emotions are difficult to ride that it's easy to lose control one possible result is death hitching a wagon to a star of course materialism can take one to a destination where nothing else exists but the ephemeral and it's a cold lonely location br br a word should be said about the philosophy of friedrich nietzsche whose will to power is stressed in baby face by the elderly philosopher who befriends lilly when she is still turning tricks for her old man baby face was released the same year adolf hitler came to power in germany though it's highly unlikely that the semi literate hitler understood much about nietzsche he considered himself a nietzschean to the nth degree and touted it along side his other rantings baby face serves as an indictment of the popular interpretation of nietzsche's will to power concept especially in the final scenes br br although you've got the cutest little baby face is apropos as a theme for baby face an even more telling and applicable melody is w c handy's st louis blues played throughout the film especially at times when the camera has to drift away from what would otherwise be sexually explicit scenes st louis blues is also used wisely toward the end as lily begins to see beyond materialism to eternal values chico is singing a raw salacious version of st louis blues when lily now disagreeing with the lyrics orders her to stop br br the restored version of baby face makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude toward sex as power than many a new hollywood release by all means watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy
<START> i thought this movie was pretty good some parts were corny but that's understandable since it was made more than 55 years ago i thought the best performance in the movie was given by michele morgan who played millie convincingly jack haley is also really good as mike o'brien even though i'm not a big frank sinatra fan i think he was very good in this movie if your have a craving for a silly over the top musical comedy higher and higher is the movie for you br br
