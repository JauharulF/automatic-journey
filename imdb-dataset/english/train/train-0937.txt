<START> this movie is outrageous by outrageous i mean awful i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke the acting got progressively worse as the movie advanced and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be prudent to blink post mordem that was not intelligent truthfully stevie wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watching this movie bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends
<START> this review is dedicated to the late keith moon and john entwistle br br the original drum and bass br br there seems to be very little early who footage around these days if there is more then lets be 'aving it now a days it tends to be of a very different kind of who altogether a parody a shadow of their much better years to be fair not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore they've earned their respect and with overtime br br this concert footage for me is one of their best to command an audience of around a 400 000 plus strong crowed takes skill charisma wit and a whole lot of bloody good music br br we all know of the other acts on the bill the doors their last ever show weeks before jim morrison died moody blues hendrix taste free and many more the point being that whoever were there it was the who that the majority had come to see this show was one year after the great hippie fest of the 1960's woodstock the film and record had come out and so had the who's greatest work to date tommy the ever hungry crowd wanted a taste to be able to experience their own unique event to be able to grove and love in the knowledge that this gig was their own to do this you needed the best of what rock 'n roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd br br at two 'o clock in the morning in late august 1970 the m c announces ladies and gentlemen a small rock 'n roll band from shepherds bush london the 'oo br br john entwistle's body suit is of black leather on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassel's and long flowing hair keith in a white t shirt and jeans as pete had his white boiler suit and doc martins that he'd preferred to wear br br the who never stopped their onslaught of high energy rock for over two hours performing theirs and other artists' greatest tracks such as young man blues shaking' all over and then as on queue keith baiting the crowed to shut up it's a bleeding opera with tommy the rock opera the crowed went wild this is what they had come to hear and the who didn't disappoint straight into overture and never coming up for air until the final note of tommy can you hear me amazing br br to capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world was a fantastic piece of cinematic history br br the english dvd only comes in a soundtrack of english linear pcm stereo were as in the states i think you can get it with 5 1 at least check local press for detailsÂ on that okay br br the duration of the dvd is 85 minutes with no extras which is a disappointment yes for a slice of rock and festival history this dvd would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play for some of the best who concert footage as it was meant to be live raw and in your face br br i would have given this dvd ten if it wasn't for the lack of 5 1 and some extras would have been nice br br thanks roger pete john and keith
<START> i love horror movies that brings out a real amount of mystery like say silent hill which i found to be quite good but still was missing something and movies that keeps you guessing this i thought was one of those movies at first the movie starts out with some really good suspense and builds up a good starting point for a good horror scene but after that it just rolls down the hill and from there it only goes faster and faster down i mentioned silent hill at first for a reason because i can see a lot of stolen themes from that movie in here all in all i would say watch silent hill instead of this one its better its more scary it has a lot more suspense and also the ending is a lot better and best of all you wont feel ripped off as i did with this one this just seems to be one of those i like that movie so i'm gonna re make it in my own really bad version kinda movie oh and one more thing lordi in a horror movie thats like trying to scare a kid with a care bear who has hug me and i will love you forever written on the stomach of it
<START> i rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie i figured that you really couldn't go wrong with a concept of ex girlfriend with super powers br br but the movie was confused and pointless br br it seemed that at every turn the writer kept throwing junk in also the writer kept throwing in way too much toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could love br br it seems that it could have been so simple to draw a story out of fatal attraction super hero but i guess not br br this is not a fun romantic comedy it was advertised to be you could not take a child to see it and you would be embarrassed seeing it a date br br if the writer could have done a basic story around the high concept and cleaned it up the movie might have a fighting chance br br a serious waste of time br br b
<START> first of all i was expecting caged heat to be along the same lines as ilsa the wicked warden boy was i wrong in no way is this film 70s exploitation chix in chains or women in prison sure the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison who wear street clothes btw quite comical but nothing happens br br there aren't strong rivalries no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape and no inmates make out there are 2 shower scenes that i suspect is just recycled footage but no fights breaks out no one is seduced here or anywhere for that matter aside from the lack of plot unconvincing unsympathetic and flat characters a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to free their fellow inmates br br puh lease the movie should have just ended off with the escapees riding off into the sunset as opposed to letting this mess continue br br i feel scammed
<START> on the face of it ruiz has set out to make a psychological thriller although it's not as satisfying as a classic piece in that genre there are compensations the tensions generated between huppert and balibar as women calmly but calculatingly at war over a boy they both claim are compelling however in a true european art house style ruiz doesn't give us release of this tension as the women alternately also try to behave compassionately towards each other the only raised voice is that of huppert's waking from a nightmare an uncontested irrational event in the film br br in fact if we follow the title the film is as little about its thriller skeleton as jane campion's in the cut instead it is an intergender psychological study focusing on men the boy camille nils hugon decides on a practical joke playing his mother off against an emotionally vulnerable other woman both women seem to pander to him rather than scold and this compounds the problem in the background is an intemperate psychologist charles berling swift to confront the women in his life his sister huppert the nanny or his pa and so acting as a symbolic adult counterbalance to the calm and we learn manipulative camille it is particularly interesting that like the father in henry james' the turn of the screw denis podalydes' law enforcer father is absent for the duration of the film ruiz fashions an oedipal moment out of huppert's reaction to his return at the film's close br br read either as a thriller or as a psychiatric essay this film is ultimately rather disappointing i'm officially rather fed up with mme huppert's screen method which is too buried and so i'll be looking to see her on stage before i come back to her european enjoyed heaven's gate films again the support is good ruiz does the cast no favours though quite apart from some poor lighting and some wilfully odd shots its as if his direction has left characterisation quite out of reach i'm thinking particularly of edith scob's shamanic neighbour to isabelle who acts knowing but communicates bafflement the set pieces do not link up to a forward driving plot the tension i have already referred to is not only weakly dissipated but wasted in its directional potential br br want to see a good contemporary french thriller go and see l'appartement instead 4 10
<START> at the end of dragon heat all i could think of was why i bothered sitting through the whole thing br br the film's premise is interesting and that as well as maggie q is what attracted me to the film in the first place but was i ever disappointed writer director daniel lee can't hold a candle to the likes of john woo ringo lam and corey yuen br br this has to be one of the most annoyingly directed films i have ever seen lee is so wrapped up in his visual style and i use that phrase incredibly loosely that he fills the film with completely needless black and white stills freeze frames slow motion fast motion and other visual nonsense i suppose he did all that to make up for the lack of a good story or dialogue br br the action scenes are nothing special and play out like some hopped up music video more than anything else there is little to care about any of the characters including two supposedly professional snipers who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn from the inside who are then laden with some of the cheesiest dialogue i have seen in one of these hong kong actioners br br the plot is devoid of any twists and turns from the initial set up everything unfolds in predictable fashion and lee feels the need to keep reminding us of the characters' back stories in case we didn't get it the first several times this is awfully amateurish writing and film making and wastes the talents of sammo hung michael biehn and maggie q though to be frank i am hard pressed to remember biehn being in any good film that was not directed by james cameron br br if you really are in the mood for a great hong kong actioner you are much better off sticking to some of the staples john woo's the killer 1989 and hard boiled 1992 ringo lam's city on fire 1987 which quentin tarantino stole for reservoir dogs 1992 or his point blank 1967 remake full contact 1992 or even check out yuen's so close 2002 a supremely entertaining yet preposterous popcorn flick and there's always the terrific french police actioner the nest 2002 br br true most if not all are a bit over the top but they were films that remain exciting thrilling and even suspenseful they have characters we care about and mind blowing action sequences br br dragon heat on the other hand is just terribly mediocre the trouble is that lee has not made a bad action film he has made a dull one
<START> a phenomenal achievement in awfulness it's actually hilariously awful br br first off nicholas cage must now have made it to the finals in the over emoting category in his acting class wearing new hair plugs and with a face that has been lifted so many times his pinned back ears seem to be straining to touch in the back he oozes not only a sick smarmiess but creates a hero character that you have no vested interest in br br i don't know what it is with neil labute and female characters he makes females out to be totally deviant and evil and pays them back by having cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all b es a few times too i've enjoyed labute's early films and a few of his plays but it's a strange fascination he has br br i'd give this film a 2 out of 10 solely based on ellen burstyn's performance by the time she finally makes her appearance bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead it seems like all hope may be lost she deserves an oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a straight face and when she appears wearing a white mumu and blue white and gold face paint booming about the wicker man you know that working with scorcese and friedkin really prepped her for this role dang well br br this movie is so wrong headed and cuckoo that is has to be seen to be believed br br highlights include nicholas cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill br br nicholas cage stealing a bicycle and looking like ms gulch from the wizard of oz riding around on it br br nicholas cage running around the island kicking down doors looking for the missing girl br br leelee sobieski plummeting from a once promising acting career in a brawl with cage br br ellen burstyn dancing around in a said while mumu br br nicholas cage screaming who burned it who burned it who burned it who burned it who burned it who burned it for no reason br br nicholas cage in a bear costume i'm not kidding running through the woods taking off the costume but leaving the bear feet on and then doing some karate moves to some villains br br and you haven't lived until you have seen the final 15 minutes of the movie and its dreadful epilogue that looked like it was shot yesterday in your cousin's basement br br needless to say if you can make it through this film without laughing out loud then you deserve a medal there was actually a point in the movie where i stopped snickering to wonder if maybe this wasn't an elaborate send up of hysteria films only to be reminded when cage would scream shout whisper his dialogue that he really was taking himself quite seriously br br i think this one is destined to be a cult film all over again just because it's so dreadful
<START> taped this late night movie when i was in grade 11 watched it on fast forward i sugest you do the same i though it would be and action film but went to a cort tv type movie in the end it fits in with the early 70's social activest type films glad i missed that era 2 10
<START> jean rollin artistic nonsense about vampires aliens and the quest for immortality br br the women are beautiful and the photography stunning the dialog is inane its a laughable mess great to look at but as any semblance of a horror film or thriller purely awful i'm trying to figure out if we're suppose to be scared or not at the same time is it a put on or not its an odd mix of art film and horror that never quite meshes and while its nice to look at it never seems to mean anything and its by no means scary even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of frisson its well made pretentious twaddle something to leave on in the background as a living wall paper for those who like naked women
<START> i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943 though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness the film is set in 1940 just before the entry of the us into the war paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family he's a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture bette davis is his very understanding and long suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time as the film begins they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years they are going to relax and stop running br br the problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems while this had a very noble goal at the time it just seems phony today in particular the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true it sounded more like anti fascism speeches than the voices of real children they were as a result extremely annoying particularly the littlest one who came off at times as a brat about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them though he had no discernible accent br br it's really tough to believe that the ultra famous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog as it just doesn't sound true to life the story was based on the play by his lover lillian hellman and the basic story idea and plot is good but the dialog is just bad at times overall an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments but that's really about all
<START> here are the matches adv advantage br br the warriors ultimate warrior texas tornado and legion of doom v the perfect team mr perfect ax smash and crush of demolition ax is the first to go in seconds when warrior splashes him for the pin 4 3 adv warriors i knew ax wasn't a healthy man but if he was that unhealthy why bother have him on the card this would be his last ppv eventually both legion of doom and demolition job out cheaply via double disqualification 2 1 adv warriors perfect applies the perfect plex on texas tornado for the pin he then attempts the same on warrior but warrior no sells it and kicks out warrior comes back with a splash to pin perfect and become the sole survivor 5 10 br br the dream team dusty rhodes koko b ware and the hart foundation v million

wwf is over shortly afterwards it is niedhart who falls victim to dibiase with help from virgil 3 2 adv dibiase's team rhodes next after an undertaker double axe handle off the top rope but doesn't leave quietly attacking brother love undertaker goes after dusty and gets counted out despite not being the legal man 2 1 adv dibiase's team almost straight after greg gets caught in a cradle by hart trying to put the figure four leg lock on him and gets pinned it comes down to hart v dibiase and after a few minutes of nice wrestling bret gets his body cross reversed by dibiase for the pin dibiase is the sole survivor at least hart is put to good use 6 10 br br the vipers jake 'the snake' roberts 'superfly' jimmy snuka and the rockers v visionaries rick 'model' martel warlord and power and

before despite hitting warlord with the ddt roberts gets counted out chasing after martel the visionaries are the first team in survivor series history to completely survive as one not much here worth watching to be honest as the psychology is rushed 3 10 br br hulkamaniacs hulk hogan 'hacksaw' jim duggan bigbossman and tugboat v natural disasters earthquake dino bravo barbarian and haku one bossman slam eliminates haku early in the bout 4 3 adv hulkamaniacs duggan gets his 2 by 4 out after whacking earthquake with it to get disqualified 3 3 bravo commits career suicide shortly afterwards

dibiase stun guns santana afterwards for the pin 4 2 adv dibiase's team hogan kicks out of the power plex and proceeds to pin roma after a clothesline effectively killing off power and glory's push 3 2 adv dibiase's team hogan eliminates martel by count out and dibiase with the leg drop for the pin 2 1 adv hogan's team hogan finally allows warrior into the match who quickly disposes of former nemesis hercules after a splash a very predictable ending to the point of nauseous 2 10 br br overall too many matches and too little time obviously had a detrimental effect as the wrestlers were almost waiting on a conveyor belt to be pinned most of the heels were decimated by warrior and hogan which is a poor way to handle a great roster of wrestlers
<START> that reviewers liked this movie surprises me the plot is a muddle the characters are wooden michael bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them no one has any redeeming quality or point of interest this is not an edgy work it is not imaginative it is not ironic it is no clever there is nothing straight forward about this tedious work that is missed theatrical release is not surprise that the this network airs it diminishes that venue i definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the garden smart show on pbs or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television if you encounter it on daytime television take a long walk even if you walk in smog you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles life is short this movie is long
<START> this movie never made it to theaters in our area so when it became available on dvd i was one of the first to rent it for once i should listened to the critics and passed on this one br br despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing i can see now why it went straight to video br br i had thought that with bloom ledger and rush it could have some value all have done wonderful work in the past br br the movie was slow moving and never pulled me in i failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast forward just to get to the end br br i do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes it won't satisfy even that
<START> i saw this movie a few years back on the bbc i sat thru it how i don't know this is way up there in the so bad it'good charts kidman baldwin and pullman must cringe when they see it now i think woody allen would have worked wonders with the outlandish plot and baldwin's part could have been played with gusto by leslie nelson it was on again tonight i tried to watch it again but life's too short the few minutes i watched was for the lovely nicole she was so hot around 93 has baldwin ever made a good movie pullman played his stock in trade nice but dim character the f word coming out of his mouth when the lady from frasier miscast ed as a detective accuses him of murder sounds so wrong stay well away
<START> astounding this may have been a poor attempt at remaking the already recreated omen movie but i sure enjoyed it br br that last man who commented is a fool this movie was one of a kind and the music dark jerry goldsmith himself would had applaud this movie br br great recommendations from myself to watch or buy this film br br i collect horror movies and soundtracks so listen to what i have to say not that other idiot br br there is only one thing that do not fascinate me the endings br br according to prophecy it is all inaccurate including final conflict and left behind br br but my conclusion being there great movies and should be seen before the great depression falls upon us and before the democrats take over the presidency too br br so signed jacob eder a farmer with a mastermind
<START> lost isn't the greatest tv show in history but it's not far off it doesn't have the plot or characterisation of the west wing or possibly even early er however it is arguably the most continuously gripping show i have every come across i love the way i can't guess what's going to happen i love the re telling of the characters' back stories which often give rise to new dimensions for us to see them in in some ways i want the show to last forever but i think they can get 6 7 seasons out of it before they have to end it on a glorious high the combination of the characters and their nationalities coupled with the show's fluidity for moving backwards and forwards thus extending dead characters life spans all adds to the overwhelming sense that this show is something very different from what we are used to it's captivating surprising and here's a little suggestion for all of you conspiracy theorists more than a little interactive keep those internet discussions going you're only adding to the plot
<START> what a piece of stupid tripe br br i won't even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show it's not worth the time the one comment i will make is why get such a dumb inarticulate doofus to be the star br br there aren't many more dismal testimonials to the deteriorating mental condition of the networks than the fact that fox has stated it will not bring back john doe a decent series but will bring back brain dead drivel like joe millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the american public br br fox has lost it imho
<START> i'm sorry but this may have been scary in 1978 when it came out but in modern times it just doesn't hold up the only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where michael kills his sister judith wearing his halloween mask the most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter the film goes downhill from there and doesn't pick up until the last fifteen minutes but by then it's too late we the audience have lost all interest in the story there is barely any character development and people always rave about laurie being such an exceptional heroine when there really isn't much to her i'm sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie but if you want a great horror movie go watch the shining or rosemary's baby those are the two best horror films ever made halloween is certainly not in their ranks i can't believe roger ebert gave it four stars for there is no way this film could ever deserve such a high rating
<START> this is an absurdist dark comedy from belgium shot perfectly in crisp black and white benoÃ®t poelvoorde man bites dog is on fine form as roger the angry obsessive father of a family in a small sullen belgian mining town roger is a photographer who along with his young daughter luise visits road accidents to take photos he is also obsessed with winning a car by entering a competition where the contestant has to break a record and he decides that his son michel must attempt to break the record of perpetually walking through a door he even hires an overweight coach to train him michel dresses as elvis and has a spot on a radio show called 'cinema lies' where he describes mistakes in films luise is friendly with near neighbour felix a pigeon fancier roger is a callous figure as he pushes michel right over the limit during the record attempt which almost results in his death interspersed throughout the film are magritte like surreal images it's undeniably charming and well worth your time
