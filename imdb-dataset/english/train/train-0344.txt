<START> simply the best estonian film that i have ever seen although it is made by a finnish director ilkka jÃ¤rvi laturi tallin pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold a national treasure that belongs to the republic of estonia but at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many eastern european countries at that time in the early 90s soviet union fell into pieces and many countries such as estonia became independent now the conditions may be better in most of those countries but in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the soviet era had left them as inheritance and many of them still do at least on some level br br tallinn pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a well written script the actors are also very good especially jÃ¼ri jÃ¤rvet perhaps the best known estonian actor plays snaut in tarkovski's solaris playing and old gangster who's slowly becoming tired of his way of life but the most astonishing performance comes from monika mÃ¤ger a child actor playing terje a boyish girl in her early teens whose presence in the plot is quite essential and her name is not even mentioned in the imdb credit list w br br there are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time but tallinn pimeduses does that unfortenately jÃ¤rvi laturi's other films are far from this kind of achievements his first one kotia pÃ¤in was too artificial and his latest history is made at night was just a weird mess
<START> documentaries of this kind are often very opinionated this film seems to take all opinions out and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided it is sad the conditions these poor people have to work in this film does a great job of showing the ugly side of sweat shops the film mardi gras made in china was a good way of showing the world how something as petty as beads for a celebration can effect the lives of so many people in another country br br i had to watch this film for an english class where we spent our time talking about sweat shops and how some people are trying to eliminate them and this film helped get the topic rolling it was a great very informative movie and i'd recommend anyone see it it kinda opens your eyes
<START> might not consider this having a spoiler but i'd rather be cautious than careless i never saw this movie when i was little i fell in love with it the first time i saw it with my three year old daughter i can watch it over and over again br br for the little acting ilene woods did in her lifetime she was a wonderful voice for cinderella very appealing very believable the music really fit the movie perfectly the acting was great loved the mice you really hated lady tremain and the step sisters they were just awful the cartoonists depicted the spoiled behavior very well br br this is a wonderful movie especially if you are into love stories my daughter has seen the movie about 25 times and still gets excited at the end
<START> most of the atomic age monster movies i saw on television as a kid and some of them the blob included scared the daylights outta me movies like invaders from mars made it all too clear to us small fry that kids just weren't to be trusted when it came to things like things invading the homeworld the blob just reiterated that fact i recall fondly late evenings spent stretched on the floor watching as body snatchers and martian invaders and blobs seeped into an unsuspecting society there was a summer in the early 1980s when a local science museum in richmond virginia ran an atomic age classic every weekend these were 16mm films and most were black and white and the projector was noisy and the color print of the blob had faded to a faint pink but man was it fun i dragged my mother along and she enjoyed it as much as i did it was there at that science museum that i truly fell in love with the blob the filmmaker's intent was of course to make money but it was the sincerity of all involved from the filmmakers to the talent the players that made me fall in love with this movie corny you bet cheesy they don't get any cheesier but man what a movie
<START> those familiar with the two previous cube films pretty much know what they can expect a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of booby trapped rooms paranoia bad acting this one is a bit different though roughly half of the film takes place outside the cube where we get to watch the people watching the people inside the cube or at least five of them br br i guess cube zero aspires to explain what the deal with the cube is but you really don't get to know much more than what was covered in the two first films sure there's sort of an explanation in there but it feels pretty lame compared to what was suggested in the first film br br cube zero looks rather cheap as did its predecessors and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling i also fell pretty confident in saying that there's no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the foreseeable future they have brought back the traps from cube 1 though by that i mean that they're almost the same ones which is a bit of a shame br br i know that many people kind of appreciate this film and its ties with the first one but i just feel that it's a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that wasn't that great to begin with 1 10
<START> by my kool aid drinkers remark i mean that these are such devoted fans of the man pavarotti that they make no attempt to objectively rate this film giving this a 10 is akin to giving wally cox the award for mr universe or putting a velvet elvis painting in the louvre when this film debuted i remember the savage reviews with headlines such as no giorgio and some said it was among the worst films ever made this is definitely overstating it as well while bad and far from a great work of art there was a lot to like about the film and the movie's biggest deficit was not the acting of pavarotti nor his girth br br believe it or not the brunt of the blame rests solely on the shoulders of the writers who i believe were chimps it is rare to see a movie with such clichÃ©d dialog or goofy scenes like the food fight but even they aren't the heart of the problem the problem is that the writers intend for the audience to care about a romance that consists of a horny married middle aged man and a seemingly desperate lady perhaps european audiences might be more forgiving of this but in the united states in 1982 or today such a romance seems sleazy and selfish especially when pavarotti tells harrold that he loves his wife and this is just fun wow talk about romantic dialog sadly if they had just changed the script a little bit and made pavarotti a widower or perhaps had his wife be like the wife from a couple classic hollywood films such as from all this and heaven too or the suspect where the wife was so vile and unlikable you could forgive the husband having an affair or even killing her instead she's the loving mother of two kids who waits patiently at home while her egotistical hubby beds tarts right and left as pavarotti admits to having had many affairs before meeting harrold br br sadly even the gorgeous music of pavarotti couldn't save this film towards the end of the film there are some amazing scenes in new york where the set is just incredible and pavarotti's singing transcendent for that reason i think the movie at least deserves a 3 i really wanted to like the film more but it was a truly bad film though not quite as rotten as you might have heard br br sadly from what i have read this film might be a case of art imitating life as pavarotti's own life later had some parallels to this film though this isn't exactly the forum to discuss this in detail
<START> david mackenzie's follow up to the brilliant young adam wants to be a feel good underdog story of a lonely voyeur who is trying to confront some psycho sexual issues with his dead mother it wants to be gritty realistic and mysterious at the same time it wants to be funny and nonjudgmental of its disturbed lead as he establishes himself as an adult br br to meet this end the film tries hard to be youthful its poster has hand drawn letters looking like that of juno its original soundtrack is comprised of fast paced indie rock which tries to convince the audience that hallam is ok just a little misguided but strangely the film is anything but youthful br br like young adam this film's central mystery concerns a drowned woman in this case hallam's mother young adam keeps its mystery quiet contemplative and paced well enough to hit you with the truths as they come hallam foe does the opposite it foregrounds its character's psychosis so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside his expected parameters the opening scene is hallam in his treehouse watching his sister fooling around with her boyfriend hallam swiftly interrupts asserting his presence in the household here we see everything that hallam will do for the rest of the movie br br the mystery surrounding his mother's drowning is whether it was suicide or murder by his father's girlfriend the audience can never really trust hallam because besides being creepy we think his obsession has led him close to insanity this hindered the mystery element for me because hallam is too sporadic to be relatable right when he's found some clues that would support his claim he runs away from home at first it appearing to be looking for the police then he gets extremely sidetracked by a girl who resembles his mother which frustratingly leads the story away from the mystery element br br while jamie bell does bring out some very endearing traits in his lost character he was limited by the obviousness of his psychological needs this movie is in no way mysterious yet it is not blunt either it tries to be realistic in dealing with such issues but it adds a very self conscious spunk which registers itself as quite the opposite it goes for a soundtrack heavy trainspotting attitude to help the audience root for a protagonist who scales buildings picks locks and camps out for the sake of voyeurism these urban peeping tom adventures hallam engages in are way too difficult for an inward drawn country boy to engage in and they are not sexy giddy or pleasant they are more neutral than anything not propelling the character or story mackenzie makes you understand hallam yet he fails to build common ground br br he expects you to enjoy hallam's trials and tribulations without much ideological justification the film hinges on its audience's perspective on voyeurism the kind of person who engages in it obviously most people would be disgusted by it and hallam foe realizes that but it does not let us see hallam weigh the morality of his decisions he goes from person to person trying to fill his deep void there is a particularly disturbing line from hallam's love interest kate where she drunkenly says i love creepy boys perhaps asking the audience to do the same the line tries to foreshadow her understanding of him her motivation remains vague throughout and tries to further us from judging him it's not hard to like hallam but it is very hard to participate in his adventure if it is even an adventure at all all the while the film tries to use its flamboyant soundtrack to mask its indecisive mood br br great performances are weighed down by a film with a weak third act muddy development and needlessly ambiguous direction from mackenzie recently this film was re named for a us release and for what reason not only is it more unappealing but the hard truth is that the hallam character never earns the title 'mister '
<START> awful awful awful no i didn't like it it was obvious what the intent of the film was to track the wheeling and dealing of the movers and shakers who produce a film in some cases these are people who represent themselves as other than what they are i didn't need a film to tell me how shallow some of the people in the film industry are i suppose i'm at fault really because i expected something like roman holiday br br i'm not a movie maker nor do i take film classes but it appeared to me that the film consisted of a series of 'two shots' in the main where the actors had been supplied with a loose plot line and they were to improvise the dialogue henry jaglon makes the claim that he along with victoria foyt actually wrote the screenplay but the impression was that the actors cognisant of the general direction of the film extemporised the dialogue and it was not always successful such a case in point was when ron silver made some remark which really didn't flow along the line of the conversation and i'm not going back to look for it and greta scacchi broke into laughter even though they were supposed to be having a serious conversation because silver's remark was such a non sequitur you get the impression too that one actor deliberately tries to 'wrong foot' the other actor and break his her concentration another instance of this is when a producer tells silver to bring the documents 3 times silver looked literally lost for words i have seen one other film which looked like a series of drama workshops on improvisation and that was awful too br br the fact that jaglon was able to attract greta scacchi no stranger to australia ron silver anouk ami and maximilian schell suggests it was a 'slow news week' for them peter bogdanovich had a 'what the hell am i doing here' look on his face at all times and i expected to hear him say look i'm a director and screenwriter not an actor which would have been unnecessary to state faye dunaway seemed more interested in promoting her son liam apart from the jerky delivery of the dialogue the hand held camera became irritating even if it was for verisimilitude as i suspect the natural dialogue was and the interest in the principals became subsumed to the interest in the various youths walking along the strand trying to insinuate themselves into shot that at least approached cinema verite so that along with the irritating french singing during which i used the mute button made for a generally disappointing 90 odd minutes br br i think we should avoid apotheosising films such as this trying to see value in the film where it has little credit in order to substantiate a perceived transcendental level to it is misguided there was really nothing avant garde about it it didn't come across as a work of art and yet it wasn't a documentary either i know it was a mocumentary but the real test is whether it is entertaining i was bored out of my skull it did have one redeeming feature it pronounced 'cannes' correctly so i gave it 3 10
<START> if you read my review of syfy's dinoshark you know that i can appreciate the low budget schlock that these made for television movies can provide they're stupid they're silly but they're still pretty fun in a so bad it's good kind of way so still smacking with guilt for liking and recommending the undeniably hokey dinoshark i sat down to watch hammerhead shark frenzy a syfy original movie about a half man half hammerhead monster terrorizing people on an island with the syfy channel's sure fire recipe for creating b movie creature features and a cast that includes william forsythe and hunter tylo how could it possibly go wrong well to my surprise it actually misses the mark not by much but enough to make me not recommend it why well first of all its titular monster the dreaded hammerhead human hybrid takes a backseat to a bunch of faux military thugs who really become the movie's primary villain though the hammerhead does rack up the body count he or it or whatever you call the thing only arrives just before someone is going to be munched upon and leaves directly after the rest of the movie is filler pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers that to me is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat people br br please read the full review on my blog www horrormoviejournal blogspot com
<START> the plot had some wretched unbelievable twists however the chemistry between mel brooks and leslie ann warren was excellent the insight that she comes to there are just moments provides a philosophical handle by which anyone could pick up and embrace life br br that was one of several moments that were wonderfully memorable
<START> this movie explores the difficulties that strain hopes dreams love and friendship and incorporates humour beautifully along with a stunning cast and brilliant filming the sound track enhances and amplifies the atmosphere and mood of this work of art all actors and actresses give an extremely good performance surpassing expectation in every way parminder nagra is brought on to the big screen for the first time in this film and she is exceptional capturing the vividness and vitality that this movie is all about keira knightly also works well with her co stars and this is her best work so far br br all in all this is brilliant film and one that everyone should make the effort to see at least once
<START> lois weber self proclaimed missionary via the cinema wrote directed and produced other films on controversial subjects but this may be the first to get wide viewing thanks to tcm this film is her indictment of abortion but she cleverly muddles the issue by bringing in eugenics and birth control leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here but one may be forgiven for wishing she had used them less didactically if you have wondered what tyrone power jr 's famous father looked like here is your chance 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece it's enjoyable even if you don't appreciate the propaganda
<START> daniel day lewis is the most versatile actor alive english aristocratic snob in a room with a view passionate irish thief in in the name of the father an impudent violent butcher in gangs of new york in a performance ten times stronger than adrian brody's in the pianist and as the outrageous cristy brown with cerebral palsy in my left foot just to name a few his roles all influence eachother but each is seperate and utterly unique he changes completely with each character he takes on and i'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything anything br br as cristy brown he is stunning he does not ridicule the character and he does not pity the character a difficult achievement and cristy brown comes to life a smart man an outrageous man human br br this movie despite small scene transition faults and the like is an inspiration yes it's predictable but is it stupidly sentimental no i laughed i cried not a single moment of cheese proof that this isn't a hollywood movie br br my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant when cristy is discussing painters with eileen peter and her friends here's where daniel day lewis reaches an acting climax i'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated wheel out the cripple and his performance never slows down never falters and is beautiful simply he has a lot of screen time here i watch it again again and i never get tired of cristy's perspicacious eyes twitching and guttural speeches br br a must see fo sho yo
<START> i love this movie it was one of my favorite movies the action never stops the whole movie was done very well the ending is really good ontop of it being action filled they even have a surprised put in there for you when i saw what the movie was about on the internet i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie but sense i am such a big luke perry fan i decided to give it a chance i am glad that i did give it a chance because this was a very well though out movie it was very original whoever thought up this movie gets a standing ovation from me the acting was great luke perry did an excellent job once again i give this movie the highest rating
<START> this film is really cool every thing looks like it came out of the comic book the sets the costumes and the plot is great clark bartram is again our favorite batman he looked a bit better in dead end but he still pulls it off superman is great too the flying effects are ok but its a fan film so we cant expect them to be the greatest the shot with superman catching the car was very believable it was cool this is a movie i would definitely see if it were real its got every thing you would want in a batman superman movie one exception though i would cast the joker instead of 2 face overall i give this film a 10 because its a great film
<START> i am a big fan of ludlum's work and of the covert one books and i had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film imagine my excitement then on learning that such a movie actually existed the 'hades factor' being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start br br from the outset the film was disappointing simple elements from the film such as griffin's first meeting with smith are needlessly different from the book and much less exhilarating several characters are poorly cast too for starters dorff is woeful as smith not a bad actor just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of john smith br br re naming re assignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film for example the removal of victor tremont and the entire back story of the virus including the involvement of vaxham makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy marty zellerbach is a very large part of the book and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book is another big mistake br br rachel russel is presumably supposed to be randi russel from the book not only is she supposed to be the sister of sophie amsden should be called sophia russel but she is also supposed to work from the cia not covert one which brings me to my final point and i think one of the most important covert one doesn't even exist at this point not until the second book of the series is covert one devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorism br br to be honest i could go on all day in short if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation i'm afraid you'll be bitterly disappointed even as an action movie it is thoroughly average mainly due to very lack luster editing and poor effects the bumbled story line and dull as ditch water script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film
<START> well this just maybe the worst movie ever at least the worst movie i have ever seen they have tried out these 666 child of satan the anti christ kinda movies about 1000 times and none of them is good and this just maybe the worst of them they think that it's going to be better movie as more they use that fake blood this movie doesn't have any idea in it actors and filming is just terrible cant even make out that 10 line minium of this movie really nothing to tell about but that it's just horrible how they can make movies like that in their right mind just can't understand that this cant be a hollywood movie is it just don't go watch this use your money more wisely
<START> the movie is more about pony than grey owl it's also about aboriginals canada the english grey owl's aunts and the north bay nugget excellent story br br this is an excellent movie more like a book that raises interesting questions about cultural identity and values the key scene is grey owl admitting his imposture to pony and her reaction br br a few observations on the user ratings note that the user ratings are bi polar clustering at 5 and 7 it's not for everyone but has a strong following this movie is underrated and overlooked but will be noticed for years to come also few women have watched the movie but they rate it more highly than men has it been marketed properly br br
<START> i can't really condemn the movie because it does work there is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie but i think it's only just in the category br br there's nothing sinister in this piece and that's where the noir elements fail sure the disease might be considered sinister but i have a hard time seeing that the movie hints at a darker side blackie may be trafficking human beings the new orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie but those are really only hints br br there's no attempt made to question reed's motivations as one with do with marlowe or spade nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to blackie which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played out br br that lack of depth is what fails the movie in the end br br the story is decent the acting is good the writing and direction are well done but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over worth watching once maybe twice if you don't remember it from years ago and then putting away
<START> i've been trying to find out about this series for ages thank you imdb i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind as a 6 year old of course i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops which was absolutely chilling i talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine which i still have what i also remember though was the atmosphere which was unusual right from the beginning mysterious austere and extremely authentic when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation it's a very hard thing to capture and probably impossible in hollywood every 'odyssey' i've seen since has been an enormous let down the characters in this series seemed genuine real people ancient greek people and not some hollywood stars in costumes this is a real masterpiece but why is it not better known and why isn't it available on vhs or dvd i would just love to have the chance to see this again
