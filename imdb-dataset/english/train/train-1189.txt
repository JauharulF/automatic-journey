<START> evening is the beautiful story of the flawed love of a mother the movie split in time is magically shot amazingly acted and has a touching script vanessa redgrave plays anne grant lord a woman sun setting out of life lying in her bed her mind remembering and misfiring she recalls her first mistake claire danes plays the young anne giving a youthful vitality to dying bed ridden woman daughters nina toni collette and constance natasha richardson try to decipher the real story from the disheartening dementia her first mistake revolves around harris arden patrick wilson the man her best friend lila mamie gummer deeply loved the daughters must come to terms with their mother's past and their futures the cast is glowing in evening the collective acting energy of this movie could have powered the equipment for the production of this entire film i am so glad to see claire danes working again especially in this role she is so young and alive fully living the joys mistakes and heartbreak of young anne's first mistake this is a true feat when you realize she is playing a woman dying in bed when her life overwhelms her you can feel her desire to crack and her hopeless hope that she won't some of her facial expressions grinded on me a little but over all her performance was so radiant i was left with that only as a side note toni collette continues to prove that you can be a powerful actress without being a super model she plays the black sheep of the family a little lost nina finds a great deal of strength in her mother's mistake collette delicately avoids creating a cruel character who revels in the mistakes of her mother instead choosing the wiser path of learning from her mother's mistakes there is a great deal of infighting between nina and her sister constance their fights remind me of ones i have with my sister all the time mamie gummer who plays anne's youthful best friend is wonderful her character is stuck between her heart and her status in society even when she is crying and her heart is breaking she is incredibly regal and charming i can't wait to see her act in something else in the future vanessa redgrave's performance is very hard for me to describe her talent at making her mental status ambiguous without being wacko or even especially tragic is why it is so powerful the audience does not know if she is making up the story because she is slipping away or if these events truly happened physically and emotionally speaking redgrave is acting in a box not much physical space and limited emotional range might have been a stunner to a lesser actress but she makes the limitations work for her i was constantly amazed the movie is definitely woman focused but the men in the movie are not just accessories patrick wilson is mesmerizing as harris it is no wonder that everyone in the movie is in love with him i sure was buddy wittenborn is lila's brother spiraling out of control hugh dancy spirals buddy out of control without sending his acting down the drain glen close has my favorite scene in the movie it reminded me of the famous scene from monster's ball it is terrible and jaw dropping grief i was utterly stunned the one acting disappointment was natasha richardson while her fight scenes were memorable most of her acting reeks of melodrama it would have suited her to take an acting bath before we had to breathe her stink it's a good thing she wasn't in charge of the visuals the visuals of the movie are sparkling cinematographer gyula pados couldn't make a film richer in color light so perfectly matched to mood and emotion the visual concepts of the flash back sequences are powerful and resonating there were many scenes that could have been stopped printed mounted and sold as art i admit it i cried evening is a powerful movie evening is defiantly a chick flick but a really great chick flick if you want to impress a woman with a movie choice pick evening
<START> another fine effort by america's most underrated filmmaker his knowledge on the subject of racism is staggering and impresses me on more than one level accusations that lee is really just a devious little racist a poisonous dwarf who opportunistically exploits hollywood's affirmative action system to make movies of inferior quality is utter nonsense mere right wing propaganda the very notion that lee would resort to misusing the current climate of political correctness in america in order to produce hate filled anti white movies is simply false and malicious br br some of lee's detractors even go so far as to suggest that gotb glorifies african americans while putting down other races obviously another falsehood disseminated by people who are against peaceful co existence between different races in america and elsewhere br br my favourite scene in the movie is a lengthy dialogue early on between the rich black republican and the others in the bus the views presented by that man are simply wrong all across the board 100 untrue he lacks education unlike the brilliantly informed guys who quite deservedly throw him off the bus br br terrific performances and an intelligent script make for a viewing experience that has been rarely rivaled by any political movies made since br br i also want to point out the incessant lies that the million man march had only 80 000 people taking part in it br br and now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all the words written in capital letters br br so what message does lee send here if someone doesn't agree with your political views you simply apply violence and throw him off the bus i thought the movie said get on the bus br br apparently mr lee is for bus segregation after all i e is no different than those kkk lunatics before him the bus is only for those blacks who are in line with the democratic party's line of thinking so much for freeing the slaves br br the end credits this movie was entirely financed by black people and distributed and marketed by a major hollywood studio run by jews and whites whom farrakhan despises
<START> the good earth is not a great film by any means it is way to ordinary maybe it was different in the 1930's but who would want to see the life of a farmer it is not very interesting to me yes luis rainer and paul muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long i could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act in short wang lung muni a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds the film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis
<START> lost is an extremely well made tv series about some people that are lost on an island there's so many twists and turns that you can't really decide who your favourite character is one minute its him then he does something so he's coolest then shes about to do something so shes the coolest then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is worth the wait suspense action romance humour its got it all apart from the topless girls but thats good as it means that you can actually concentrate on the story more and story is what this is all about so if you like a good story and like suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably better i have a review on that too that you could check it out i would give lost a good 8 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable you never know what will happen next
<START> this is such a fantastic movie a western about a self concerned man jimmy stewart going up to the klondike for gold on the way he gets hassled by a local sheriff in alaska john mcintire giving a wonderfully evil performance whom he hassles back mcintire threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town which is unfortunately the only way back to the states the main chunk of the story is about the peaceful klondike town of dawson being turned upside down by new residents from mcintire's town ruth roman for instance who has come with stewart and his two companions jay c flippen and walter brennen who plays stewart's best friend builds a saloon a hollywood front for a whorehouse and tries to run the town's restaurant and hang out place out of business she paves the way for mcintire and his goons to come up too in 1953 jimmy stewart and director anthony mann made one of the peaks of the western genre the naked spur the far country is just the tiniest bit less and it contains 99 9 of what made that film so special without of course feeling like a cheap copy like the naked spur the far country boasts beautiful on location cinematography the landscape is gorgeous stewart gives one of his best performances nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954 rear window i suppose it could be considered cliche as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end still stewart plays it so damn well he makes this character very human and the supporting performances are universally fantastic in addition to those i've mentioned the adorable french actress corinne calvet is very good and i ought to single out walter brennen as well he seems to have specialized in playing best friends his relationship with stewart is very touching since he is at first the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man the screenplay is very well written and mann's direction is impeccable a masterpiece 10 10
<START> william hurt scuba diving scientist us agents running the investigation abroad the sick contaminated man kicking butt after falling 20 feet on his back and running away sniper missing and not killing hurt just wounding him but the second kill shot is dead on waste of time to compare this to falling down as other reviewers did is ridiculous oh and by the end of the movie they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands except for the evil agent and hurt decides to kill him by giving him the virus handshake what btw when did imdb require 10 lines of text i'm just babbling here doesn't this just dillute the content of reviews if you are required to have x amount of lines
<START> i hope whoever coached these losers on their accents was fired the only high points are a few of the supporting characters 3 of 5 of my favourites were killed off by the end of the season and one of them was a cat to put that into perspective br br the whole storyline is centered around sex and nothing else sex with vampires gay sex with gay vampires gay sex with straight vampires sex to score vampire blood sex after drinking vampire blood sex in front of vampires vampire sex non vampire sex sex because we're scared of vampires sex because we're mad at vampires sex because we just became a vampire etc br br nothing against sex it would just be nice if it were a little more subtle with being peppered into the storyline perhaps have a storyline and then shoehorn some sex into it but they didn't even bother to do that and anna paquin is a dizzy gap tooth bitch either she sucks or her character sucks i can't figure out which br br another part of the storyline that i find highly implausible is why 150 year old vampire bill who seems to have his things together would be interested in someone like sookie she's constantly flying off the handle at him for things he can't control he leaves for two days and she already decides that he's not coming back and suddenly has feelings for dog man give me a break she's supposed to be a 25 year old woman not a 14 year old girl people close to her are dying all over and she's got the brightest smile on her face because she just gave away her v card to some dude because she can't read his mind as the main character of the story i would've hoped the show would do a little more to make her understandable and someone to invest your interest in not someone you keep secretly hoping gets killed off or put into a coma i can't find anything about her character that i like and even the fact that she can read minds is impressively uninspiring and not the least bit interesting br br i will not be wasting my time with watching season 2 come june
<START> you loose 100 iq points just for tuning in this show has to be awful i refuse to tune in from just what i've seen in commercials where did they dig this guy up at anyway also what do they intend to do next season the secret is out everyone already knows the set up are they going to look for people who has been living under a rock to star in next season where are they going to dig up more stupid women no wonder america is a big joke to outsider's look what you are watching
<START> i wasted 5 75 to see this crappy movie so i just want to know a few things br br what was the point of the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie the disease had nothing to do with being split in half br br what was the point of dragging karen into the shed she already totally infected her room they could have just locked her in there where she would have been safer br br why would the hermit be running around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his relative the hog lady to take him to the hospital br br why didn't any of the characters bother to walk into town to get help when things started getting bad are they all really that lazy br br even if paul was threatened by the guy w the shotgun for peeping on his wife paul could have just sent jeff or bert back to the house to ask for help the girl he loves is deteriorating br br what was the point of the box br br why did jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected if he was that big of a jerk to leave in the first place wouldn't he have just gone back home br br if the police went to all the trouble of gathering up the kids and burning them on the fire pit why did they throw paul halfway into the river it wasn't even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated br br who makes lemonade out of river water that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it why couldn't the two kids have just use the tap water it was contaminated too so the stupid ending would still work
<START> since the title is in english and imdb lists this show's primary language as english i shall concentrate on reviewing the english version of gundam wing 2000 as presented in the bandai released dvd set my actual review for the whole series is under imdb's entry of shin kidÃ´ senki gundam w 1995 br br very little is changed in respect to plot script and characterization its adaptation to english and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in purists can stick to japanese all they want but for a more realistic experience i recommend the english track since all the characters except heero yuy are not japanese most of them are caucasian in fact with a couple of non japanese asians for one thing the characters' personalities come across more directly than in the japanese version the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give or take performances but a very well cast group of actors br br wing gundam's pilot heero yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity voiced by mark hildreth who's deadpan delivery can be criticized as bad acting but it matches heero's personality very well br br deathscythe gundam's duo maxwell ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends he is possibly the best acted character in the whole show masterfully played by scott mcneil he may sound a little too old for his age but duo's english voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal japanese one br br trowa the pilot of heavyarms is a lost lonely soul who's only purpose so far has been combat despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him he only knows how to kill not to befriend kirby morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as trowa barton br br quatre rebarba winner is voiced by brad swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand a huge plus point is that quatre no longer sounds like a girl and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the japanese version but a bona fide typical 15 year old guy br br the impulsive but determined wufei chang voiced by ted cole may seem a little over the top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of heero and trowa br br relena darlian sounds older in english voiced by lisa ann bailey this might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development br br zechs merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the japanese version both voices bring out different sides to the same character his japanese voice is haughty authoritative and commands respect keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature his english voice by brian drummond is more subdued sounding more devious and snake like highlighting zechs' secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals br br the members of oz are a mixed bag really treize kushrenada voiced by david kaye is given a more realistic and down to earth performance compared to his larger than life japanese style of speaking however lady une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the japanese version and lucrencia noin just sounds bored most of the time the cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either br br i would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds the maganac corp's voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents the members of the romerfeller foundation would have also sounded better with some classy european accent that reflects their status of nobility br br despite underwhelming acting from the side characters the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over the top and more realistic rendition of gundam wing's script very faithful to the original japanese script keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics war and human nature sadly it also retains the flaws of the original japanese script
<START> the movie is far more sophisticated and intelligent is its exploration of sexual tension than such american attempts as 9 and a half weeks the courtroom scene itself with the couple copulating in the cage while the heroine pleads for their orgasm is amazing i have not seen this movie in 20 years but it made indelible pictures in my mind it is rich in texture and successful in creating a world where sex is the engine for all activity and at its bottom is the yawning angst that lives in us all the plot is european and it meanders a bit but so does life especially when you are 17 and have a constant hard on
<START> moonwalker by michael jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family br br before the real story of the movie starts we get a performance of the bad tour man in the mirror and it kicks off a great movie after that we get a kind of a collage of michael carrier as it was until moonwalker came out in 1988 after a few music videos also speed demon leave me alone etc the story starts br br the plot is basically that michael and his 3 friends who are kids are being chased by the bad guy of the story mr big because they discovered his evil plans of getting children all over the world hocked on drugs during the chase we see fantastic segments fx michaels video for smooth criminal which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences etc but then one of the kids get kidnapped by mr big and michael will haft to save her before she gets a drug addict br br during the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days standards but also impressive today for instance see michael turning in to a robot spaceship in order to protect his friends it's so cool br br the movie ends with a performance of come together later published in michaels double album of history and you leave the movie with a magic feeling amazing br br i recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the tv and now some parents might stand up and say but michael jackson is an alleged child abuser yeah he is indeed but come on we all know it isn't true wait and see
<START> i just want to add my two cents worth and forgive me if i am repeating something that has already been posted but i feel it is worth reminding people of the everlovin' genius of damon runyon without the wonderfully street hilarious writings of damon runyon this film would never have been made nor most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers the like from before 1960 damon runyon worked as a newspaper man and he was from colorado but he sure did get the street scene of the east coast if you are not a dedicated fan of old hollywood comedies i would recommend a few other flicks from damon runyon's writings the lemondrop kid and little miss marker both feature bob hope who aside from his politics has always been a funny man as a west coast liberal i find his politics fairly funny too damon runyon lives
<START> such a long journey is a well crafted film a good shoot and a showcase for some good performances however the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of jack of all plots and master of none also western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1 7 hours recommended for those with an interest in india
<START> the performances were superb the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a victorian living historian i was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detail br br i wouldn't say you need any knowledge of the kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge do not expect as some rather silly people do any of the characters to have the auzzie accent as we know it it was at that time a country during infancy br br ok the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film gregor jordan said in the extra feature on the dvd that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest' and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up here br br see it and you will not be sorry
<START> this is such a great film never mind the low rating here i really have no idea where that came from they must be discussing a different film then because i absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure br br it's story was so original and charming i really can't think of anything bad to say about it maybe it has to be ''your type of thing'' but i saw this with my sister and my mother and we all were taken by it br br the acting was also very good and that is hard to do in a film like this but i found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic br br i've always been very fond of dougray scott and found his new ''dark'' role very interesting it is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy but i absolutely had no problem with that this time even more so i adored him br br everyone who loves a good thriller drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this film no question about that anyone wanting to see a film with 80 bloodshed should go rent something else though but i guess the title already kind of gives that away this is a love story not saw 3 br br i give this film 4 out of five stars good job br br xxx enjoy
<START> this clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking jared rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly created character in an ill fated movie thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie the film's main thrust is how a boy's temporary excursion into the canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother's extramarital affair unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random survival events including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid isn't just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie and what a nightmare it is furthermore despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded br br all in all a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to much less innocent kids
<START> damp telling of the american revolution br br when farmer 'tom dobb' al pacino and his son arrive in new york harbor they are immediately conscripted by street urchin annie lennox annie lennox to contribute to the war effort br br after getting chopped down by bits of chain link fired from british cannons tom and his son are promptly chastised by continental army sympathizer 'daisy' nastassja kinski for 'not standing their ground' following this kodak moment a series of digressive chapters take place including tom's participation in a 'foxhunt' in which he must carry a model of poor old georgie washington stuffed in effigy while running from a lace handkerchief wielding english captain manning redwood and having a barbecue with a group of iroquois indians as they plan on the best way to sneak back into the fighting so al and his ingrate kid can kick the crap out of british officer donald sutherland's butt br br director hugh hudson presents a unique style of film making and the atmosphere is as thick as the proverbial london fog but the scriptwriter's painting of the redcoats as evil monsters once again reveals hollywood's patented hatred of the british br br steven berkoff appears as an enlisted american soldier
<START> this movie down shifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd grinding gears all the way to the sappy b movie finish line the con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie that is worth seeing the scene with harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast you may miss it definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by robert osborne in his tcm intro to this bad to mediocre confusion there is no real conflict and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints especially the unbelievable character al i wonder if he's got a job for me in cincinnati
<START> 'a smile like yours' is a pathetic comedy that actually makes no sense i don't mean that the story was complicated but the entire plot is based on one thing a couple's desperate and expensive unsuccessful attempts to conceive children people who tried that hard must've forgotten of the option of the adoption to which this movie is not kind to br br lauren holly plays jennifer robertson a complete contradiction to anything offered by the women's liberation movement exhibiting almost no sense of independence she is quite a boring character as the dreamy housewife with absolutey nothing else on her mind but to have kids like a dumb 50's romance comedy greg kinnear is her submitting husband who likewise displays no personality no independence and from us no interest br br they are the two most boring and often annoying characters and they hardly make for topics of a comedy that should present itself with many mishaps which should arise from a couple doing all they can to get pregnant except they really don't do anything except go to a fertility clinic and shell out a whole lot of money to do what they could do in the privacy of their own except for that in vitro fertilization number the plot hardly allows for any mishaps because well the couple don't do anything to create any sort of bizarre situation they just go to this clinic so what br br the subplots are meant to test the faithfulness of the couple a necessary moral element of the story since the couple does plan on conceiving children together jennifer works at a new age shop with her friend played by joan cusak and they are in the business of developing aphrodesiacs christopher macdonald plays the intrested buyer and jennifer is the promising negotiator of a pretty price for her and her friend's product the subplot hardly offers much to keep you interested although joan cusak is pretty funny in the restaraunt scene br br danny kinear is an architect who finds an opportunity to make some extra money to cover the clinic bills by taking on a job in seattle where his boss is the crass seductress also another hopeless helpless female character who tries to influence danny as dumb as he is to have an affair with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife for reasons i don't care to give away jill hennesy is good in the role but her character is too predictable and too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict for danny it is stupid and once again hardly interesting br br the overall movie itself is utterly boring and hardly funny at all save the restaraunt scene and the airline flight the plot offers nothing that is really attention grabbing even if the story was entirely about two people trying to conceive the writers could've figured out several hilarious mishaps to develop out of that second the main characters are completely boring they are complete silouhettes of dumb 1950s comedies with happy wife and clueless husband so even without mishaps present in the plot the characters themselves offer nothing interesting let alone funny br br joan cusak should've been in the lead and someone else should've taken kinnear's part cusak would've made even a lousy story outrageously funny as she sometimes does in her co starring role here this is definitely one to pass up
