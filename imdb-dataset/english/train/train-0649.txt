<START> i got to see this just this last friday at the los angeles film festival at laemlee's on beverly this movie got the most applause of all the films that evening considering that two music videos opened first i didn't know what to expect since they were very fast and attention grabbing i wasn't sure i was ready for a short immediately but to my surprise i really enjoyed this i thought the main actor demon guy was really good i was so impressed with his performance that i checked out his name i was surprised to see that this was the witchblade guy he's gotten really good especially since then either that or he was given lousy roles or had been pushed by the director really hard for this short the girl did an okay job i guess its hard since it was her first performance and being so young the dad did well also there was a lot of really nice cg work for a short both for this and the short playing next mexican hat which was also nice but i enjoyed this the most because it had the most depth and emotion and i actually cared about the characters the other was a very simple story the story was quite illustrative and dark it dealt with real topics using a more fantasy like approach to keep add people like me interested we won't even talk about the last film in the block which i left my only complaint is that i only wish i had seen more of the demon character and a little less of getting started which is why i gave it a 9 out of 10 i also thought the end credits went a little slowly otherwise it was beautifully told directed and edited the timing was very nice with a complete change from the fast mtv editing done on everything nowadays there will be more coming from this director in the future as well as the actor i now will think of him as the sorrows lost actor not the witchblade guy
<START> margret laurence probably didn't intend on having any of her novels adopted for film let alone the stone angel hagar as a character was one who constantly challenged the social norm gainsay who dare anyone and ended up nearly sacrificing her humanity in the process the symbols in the book the stone angel silver thread etc etc are constant reminders of this struggle of the old and new and the carnage so to speak along the way br br while the film is reasonably faithful to the plot of the book but it isn't really a plot kind of storytelling is it i think it missed the point on capturing the spirit of the film hagar's defiance for the sake of defiance was not there bram could have been a lot more crude than portrayed and hagar's father could have been played more traditionally so to speak if the filmmaker would insisted on stronger portrayals the film would drive the point straight to home br br along the same vein why should we see cell phones organic produce and other modernizations are we trying make some points for the sake of making some points e g the muslim girlfriend and the native people hagar and co are everything but politically correct in the book so why should we see that in the film version modernization may be an excuse for a low budget operation but using that as an excuse to send subliminal politically correct messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel and the film seems like throwing punches below the intellect br br there is also the audience it seems that we have been conditioned to see bitter old people as cute and lovable why should be laugh every time hagar is at her tantrums i doubt magaret laurence wanted her readers to laugh at or with hagar these people are frustrated and are full of angst and all we do is to laugh at them i don't think it did hagar and other folks in her situation any justice
<START> faith domergue better known as dr ruth in this island earth is the only reason to watch this film the story is very thin and once the air force buddies return to the states with a cobra curse upon them the action is just a waiting game see faith the snake woman and try to pretend the rest isn't happening
<START> if this movie was about a fictional character the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively unfortunately for the viewer the movie is based on facts that are shaded very unfairly toward ruben carter many of the smaller facts were disregarded carter was not number one contender at the time of the murders there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth but some of the larger facts like apparently being robbed of a decision to joey giardello because of racist judges is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape and completely disrespectful to giardello why hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who at best was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be was arrested multiple times for beating women is strange to me ruben carter was never by viewing his actions in the 60's and even now when he refuses to speak to his son a person that people can look up to everyone knows that jewison can direct and washington can act but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me is hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable heres a suggestion how about denzel playing a movie about himself now thats inspirational based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie i would suggest passing on this one
<START> sitting on the front porch of his burbank home ted mapes told me that he and reed hadley wore the exact same size in every item of clothing except hat br br ted one of the greatest of the stunt men said that every time zorro put on his mask he was the one on the screen br br that was a little bit of an exaggeration there were times that zorro was obviously reed hadley but in the stunts we can be satisfied it was ted at work br br and what stunts zorro's fighting legion is as witness the comments here one of the greatest of serials it is exciting and generally very well made br br reed hadley was a fine actor and as someone else commented he made a very good fop br br but admittedly it is the action that makes this movie so great br br and what else could we expect with direction by that excellent team witney and english with great music from the amazingly prolific william lava the listing here says he was uncredited but that is incorrect those other composers listed here were indeed uncredited and i don't know if they did write any of the music it sounds like lava and with villainy from among others the great charles king and with dozens of bit parts br br also noteworthy was a villain played by the radio tarzan jim pierce who was edgar rice burroughs' son in law i urge you to read his mini bio br br there is one chapter that slows things down depressingly but heck it's only a few minutes long maybe 20 and when you wade through it well you're back to the excitement br br turner classic movies deserves a great big thank you for presenting this excellent serial and we should ask tcm to bring us more br br and we should thank everyone involved that we get to see it as a chapter play or serial and not as a re cut feature
<START> i have seen all the films directed by robert redford and appreciated his love of the american people and the land in a river runs through it redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of thomas moran or albert bierstadt this film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author norman maclean and stunning camera work by phillippe rousselot serpent's kiss reigne margot br br redford's cast is perfect tom skerritt is the rev maclean a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the bible brenda blythen the mother and his sons craig schaffer and brad pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons and later complex young men both schaffer and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever it is the relationships between men father and sons brothers and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent years br br what makes these relationships special however is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue this is a literate script beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning montana rivers and mountains the words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story it is not so implausible in redford's directorial hands given the material redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again
<START> this movie is the worst i've seen in the last 5 years it is surprising how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie has accepted to act in such worthless peace of trash the film is rape beating and revenge genre couple has gone to party and on the way back they hit a deer and he went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys comes he didn't go to their car instead he has been kicked and well beaten while she tries to run the car engine which betray her and she has been gang raped then somehow she is in her fathers house and one of bad guys is her neighbor so she took shotgun and wanted to kill him so stupid scenario bellow hollywood he was against that revenge but she is raped they laugh to her so she must kill them all but once inside the house she was satisfied by pushing rifle's top in bad guys anus and went away while he has gone crazy and execute bad guy personally i think that director run out of money before finishing this because movie ends before they execute anyone else involved in this gang rape and beating which is not big surprise because sponsor obviously has seen this and wanted to take back his money lol this movie is not even for people who enjoy watching rape because they won't see anything they are looking for this director should be banned it is for upsetting that this peace of trash has been made by british cinematography which i personally like and that is the reason i've watched this don't do it yourself you have better things to do that watching stupid scenario film
<START> if you were brought up on a diet of gameshows you'll understand that you gradually need a bigger and better fix well in the world of the running man your needs will be sated for in this game show prisoners compete for freedom and the ultimate prize their very lives br br i loved this film it was such a parody on the mind numbing tripe that we watch on a daily basis it isn't one of schwarzenegger's best performances but on the whole it is a very good film the underlying idea that television corporations will one day be the real rulers of the planet is very believable and is very well portrayed in this film of course there are the usual arnie one liners my favourite is when he is about to be catapulted into the gamezone the gameshow host asks any last words arnie says yeah i'll be back but the host quips only in a re run and presses the eject button i give this film a 10 for sheer originality i must have watched it 30 or more times the only film apart from the die hard series that i watched this often br br in short do not for a minute think that you own the t v it owns you
<START> having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 christmases i feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of dr seuss' classic tale and well it's not very good first off following a classic act like chuck jones' animated tv special is going to be difficult for anyone but this interpretation is so heavy handed and padded as to be positively numbing i will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of christmas jim carrey is typically over the top here but that is completely at odds with the character of the grinch as characterised by boris karloff he was a slow burn methodical and sly there is no method to carrey's madness and that is only the most obvious error made talented actors like jeffrey tambor and christine baranski are utterly wasted here why universal why i mean i understand that tony hopkins will take just about any role offered much like his countryman michael caine but this one needs to be filed under films that should never have been made this does not bode well for the cat in the hat an even thinner tome that universal is prepping for this christmas i get the feeling that i will be making the same recommendation for that one as i am with this one skip it and either read the book or watch the tv special this is 2 hours you can never ever get back
<START> i watched about 30 minutes into this film before i finally got sick of getting bludgeoned over the head with this movie the soundtrack the so called 'plot' and each and every actor it's like they all think they're the main part of the movie and scream notice me over and over again the bad guy has his bad guy music going on and says sinister bad guy like things just in case you didn't quite catch on the good guy does brave and noble things just in case you didn't know he was the good guy and oh lord the plane scene my husband is missing oh my god it's impossible that he got up to stretch his legs or go to the toilet or anything he must be missing and yes i know his clothes were still there but honestly she woke up and started to panic before she even had time to look at the damn seat he'd been in br br as a religious girl i want to apologize to the world for wasting the film this was printed on br br and i want my 30 minutes back
<START> metamorphosis i am working my way through the chilling classics 50 movie pack collection and metamorphosis is the seventh movie in the set released in 1990 metamorphosis seems to be a remake of the atom age vampire which also featured a scientist striving for similar results set in modern times metamorphsis is not my kind of horror movie br br a university researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that would prevent aging pressured by the administration to publish his papers and produce some results or risk losing funding the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig at first thinking that he suffered no adverse side effects he eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner br br the acting is stilted and the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film the score is pandering and the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious it's absurd it's ridiculous Â at best br br as others noted the end turns into a 30 minute gag which is seemingly endless without giving too much away i'd call this one dr jekyll and mr hyde meet the creature from the black lagoon meets home alone
<START> this story had a different angle that intrigued me enough to buy a previously viewed vhs sight unseen that was a mistake br br in what could have been a very nice story about badly crippled people at a hospital and their various personalities turned quickly into a very profane soap opera with unlikeable characters br br we have bloss william forsythe the stereotype racist white person who says the f word every other sentence and is so despicable they didn't give him a first name in the movie he's a lot of fun to be around then there is raymond hill wesley snipes a fast talking womanizer snipes must have liked those fast talking hip arrogant roles because he played in a number of them like in white men can't jump then there is sweet helen hunt playing anna that wonderful caring loving person who is having an adulterous affair with the leading character in the film joel garcia eric stoltz br br yup this is heartwarming feel good type stuff it just makes my heart melt watching these nice folks but if you are one of those who loves sleazy characters portrayed by sleazy people in this sleazy film you might really like this add in a dose of hollywood political correctness and there you go what more could anyone want
<START> this is not a movie you watch for entertainment at least most people i know would not br br it's portraits the cruelty to both body and mind that happen in a war pretty well the characters seem plausible especially because you read their minds something more often found in books and rarely in movies however done very well in this piece i would place it next to all quiet on the western front and die brÃ¼cke in terms of leaving a lasting impression br br i wish i could screen it at school along with the other two movies however finding a copy of it showed to be pretty hard which is a shame
<START> bela lugosi plays dr lorenz who loves his wife so much that he will do anything to keep her young this film starts off with a wedding as the bride is about to take her vows she suddenly collapses she is pronounced dead and taken away by undertakers trouble is that these are not real undertakers but body snatchers a wave of bride deaths at the altar and their body disappearing confounds the police enter reporter patricia hunter to solve the case she does track down dr lorenz but he also decides to use her youth to keep his wife young also
<START> this movie is simply incredible i had expected something quite different form the film that i actually saw however it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its linkage with animal behavior let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is all too sexual for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a high brow sort of pornography it even features a scene that comes extremely close to rape br br meanwhile i strongly suggest seeing this rare work of sexual art every minute of the picture breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies by the way one should not forget how times have changed br br go see it itÂ´s worth your money and time
<START> i am a great fan of the batman comics and i became disappointed when i could no longer find batman the animated series on tv anymore i was excited to learn that there was going to be a new batman cartoon on tv i watched the first episode the day it premiered and i was very disappointed br br first of all the animation is very poor it looks like a cheap crappy japanese anime then again just about every modern day cartoon is like that br br the character designs are even worse batman looks more like birdman catwoman looks more like chihuahuawoman bane looks more like a red version of the hulk the penguin is a kung fu master mr freeze is some undead thing with an iceberg on his head and the riddler is a gothic marilyn manson look alike which is funny because i don't expect people who are obsessed with riddles and puzzles to be gothic br br the worst character design is that of the joker they turned him into a monkey demented bob marley kung fu fighter the joker is supposed to be batman's deadliest enemy but in this show he hardly poses a threat because his crimes are so stupid and pointless in one episode his plan was to put his joker venom in dog food oh how evil batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is haunted by the deaths of his parents which is why he fights crime this version of batman doesn't seem haunted by his parents' deaths and is not interesting at all he's also not a detective just a fighter if there's an enemy he can't defeat he won't study the enemy to find out their weak points like a detective would he'll just build a giant fighting robot to defeat them a lot of times this show doesn't even feel like a batman show just another brainless anime that's nothing but pointless fighting br br what i hate the most about this show is what they did to the villains they've taken away everything that makes them likable and relatable and turned them into stereotypical evil bad guys man bat is the biggest example in the comics he's a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness when experimenting on himself he accidentally transforms himself into a giant bat creature in this show he's a mad scientist who wants to purposely transform himself into a giant bat creature for no apparent reason just about all the villains are like that none of them with the exception of about one or two have an actual motive for their crimes br br the worst characterization is that of mr freeze in the comics freeze was a just a mad scientist until the genius writer paul dini wrote the btas episode heart of ice which gave freeze a new origin that made him a more tragic three dimensional and likable villain the episode was so popular that fans accepted it as his actual origin and it was even used in the comics as his origin even that crappy movie batman robin used it as his origin in this show he's a petty jewel thief before becoming mr freeze after becoming mr freeze guess what he's still a petty jewel thief great origin no wonder they used it over the one dini created br br as a batman fan i don't dislike this show just because it isn't like the comics because i also liked btas the batman cartoons that came after it tim burton's batman films and obviously the superb christopher nolan batman films none of them were 100 loyal to the comics but they were still very good the problem with this show is not that it's not exactly like the comics or btas it's that it lacks any sort of depth that makes other batman media so popular br br i've given this show so many chances but the more i watch the more i find that disappoints me i miss the good old days back when batman cartoons were something everyone could enjoy
<START> i just watched this movie last night and i had to put a warning out for anybody else considering to see this film in a word don't i seriously feel like this is something that a screenwriting student would have written in a quentin tarantino eddie murphy phase i e every other word was a curse word i don't have a problem with profuse cursing as in good will hunting provided it helps to delve more into the characters in this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an occassional gasp or laughter from the audience the three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype the wall street jerk the coffee house jerk and the i'm not gay just in touch with my feminine side slightly less of a jerk you just don't give a damn about any of them they are all shallow unredemable losers who you want to see lose for those who dare this film does have a couple funny moments the very beginning and the very end the toilet vibrator scene is funny in a sick kinda uh yeah way really though i would only recommend this film to my worst of enemies
<START> an enjoyable batman animated film not on par with return of the joker or mask of the phantasm but solid nonetheless i liked how the movie kept you guessing as to who batwoman was there was nice twist nice action sequences i've always been of the opinion that the batman cartoons are better then any of the pitiful batman live action film sequels the trend continues here br br 7 5 out of 10
<START> what a loss the passing of director emile ardolino was he could take a light script and with the right casting and editing put a twinkle in it and make it shine like a star this particular star may not be the brightest in the sky as great romances go but it is definitely one that keeps you tuned in to the end you really want to know how things are going to work out br br the script is perfect for cybill shepherd who at the time needed to capitalize on her moonlighting success for the new generation who was fortunately for her probably unaware of how many big screen major duds she had after a very promising start in this film she's every bit back in form as a still pining widow living vicariously through her daughter mary stuart masterson on the cusp of stardom which would peak with fried green tomatoes two years later she may have looked too young for the role but that works well for the way the story unfolds this is her film but she doesn't overstep her bounds as a lead br br shepherd graciously allows robert downey jr to carry much of the film and shows a more mature comic flair than he had in his previous films to that point and there's ample support from ryan o'neal in his best role in years and christopher macdonald masterson's natural charm pretty much coasts on its own either that or she has a way of making her character seem like a breath of fresh air with every word br br ardolino makes good use of his cast's sex appeal the same way he did with dirty dancing but this film is not quite as sizzling so you could still watch it with your parents if they happened to be in the room use your best judgment they're your parents after all i give this film a high mark because it is very user friendly romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it sublime and those who are just watching along with them should find plenty of humor to enjoy as well br br again credit goes to emile ardolino for making the most of a charming script by randy and perry howze where are they now ardolino's next film would be the phoned in sequel to three men and a baby but his final theatrical release sister act would finally give him the nine figure grossing smash hit he deserved mr ardolino your cinematic touch is missed
<START> this should have been a movie about sam and his wife the glorious peter falk and equally glorious olympia dukakis that would have been a movie worth seeing instead it's a paul reiser vehicle with a little falk thrown in the wonderful elizabeth perkins is also in this movie but you'd hardly know it i presume reiser is under the impression that he's a giant movie star who needs an appropriate vehicle he's not even more galling is that reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best women character actresses on the screen today and then shoved them all into his background dukakis does not show up until the last 15 minutes but when she does the screen glows the story is about falk and dukakis really but we're subjected to a pointless silly preposterous road trip in which reiser gets to show how very cute precious and oh so deep with psychological insight wrong he can be for instance in a restaurant scene that i imagine reiser had hoped was cassavetes like there's a laughably false confrontation between reiser and falk that is so patently ridiculous i was embarrassed for falk
