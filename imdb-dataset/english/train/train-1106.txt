<START> filmed by mgm on the same sets as the english version but in german garbo's second portrayal of anna christie benefited from practice and her apparent ease with german dialog garbo appears more relaxed and natural under jacques feyder's direction than under clarence brown's and her silent movie mannerisms have all but disappeared which made her transition to sound complete the strength she brought to the character remains here although it has been softened and garbo reveals more of anna's vulnerability the entire cast with the exception of garbo is different from the previous version of the film and garbo benefits from not having to compete with marie dressler who stole every scene she was in during the english language version in feyder's film garbo holds the center of attention throughout although the three supporting players particularly the father gave excellent performances br br feyder's direction was more assured than clarence brown's and his use of the camera and editing techniques did not seem as constrained by the new sound process as did those of brown the film moves with more fluidity than the english language adaptation and the static nature of the first film has been replaced with a flow that maintains viewer interest even william daniels cinematography seems improved over his filming of the brown version he captured garbo's luminescence and the atmospherics of the docks with style also the screenplay adaptation for the european audience made anna's profession quite clear from the start and the explicitness clarifies for viewers who were unfamiliar with the play as to what was only implied in the brown filming however the film was made before the production code was introduced which made the censorship puzzling br br garbo's oscar nomination for anna christie was always somewhat mystifying and i suspected that the nod was given more in recognition of her relatively smooth transition to sound films than for her performance however some of the academy voters may have seen the german language version of the film and they realized as will contemporary viewers that her anna christie under feyder's direction was definitely oscar worthy
<START> i can't add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here great acting balanced writing multi faceted characters a great anti hero in tony great commentary on millennial american life the integral use of psychiatry coupled with tony's mother issues are especially fresh and humorous several other characters add a lot of depth hesh's interesting history as an outsider muscling in ralphie's total irredeemable viciousness chris' dual desires in life and so on br br i have to dig into some of the criticisms however especially the 'it glorifies violence belittles italian americans' one most of the writers and actors are italian american would they attack themselves there are several positive italian american characters artie bucco the chef dr melfi and her family and the cusamanos next door to the sopranos indeed dr melfi's ex husband notes in season 1 that only a tiny minority of italian americans have ever had mob connections certainly smaller than the proportion of african americans involved in crime dare i say it in both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes br br most of the characters don't really choose the life they have family background or circumstances largely corner them into it outsiders even of italian stock who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends matthew and his friend in season 2 for example if you criticise this show i assume frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist or will grace made you want to go homosexual presumably you won't listen to rap music that discusses gangs or r'n'b which discusses promiscuity or rock music which discusses drugs or any other combination people aren't as stupid as some of you make out br br not everything is perfect however a lot of characters have only appeared once when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes tracee the dancer meadow's friend ally uncle junior's ladyfriend supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1
<START> steve carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the 40 year old virgin having only had supporting roles in such films as bewitched bruce almighty anchorman and his work on the daily show we had only gotten a small taste of the comedy that carell truly makes his own you can tell that will ferrell influenced his comedic air but carell takes it to another level everything he does is innocent lovable and hilarious i would not hesitate to say that steve carell is one of the next great comedians of our time br br the 40 year old virgin is two hours of non stop laughs or 4 hours if you see it twice like i did a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie the script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all the music fit the tone of the movie great and you can tell the director knew what he was doing br br filled with sex jokes some nudity and a lot of language this movie isn't for everyone but if you liked the wedding crashers anchorman or any movie along those lines you will absolutely love the 40 year old virgin
<START> well i just discovered that there is a show more disgusting and shocking than little britain and i like it the league of gentlemen is a sick british comedy that is about the most awful insane and disgusting small town in all the uk this place makes dibley and craggy island from the vicar of dibley and father ted seem pretty normal the format of the show is a lot like little britain except that all of it centers around the townspeople of this one hellish town both shows feature the same skits again and again every episode and some obviously inspired little britain particularly the job seeking class skit but the show differs because although it is crude like little britain hence not a show for kids the show has a sick and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all these shows in particular animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show br br now if you haven't guessed this is not a show for kids the easily offended or normal people and that's probably why i liked it however you really do need very thick skin and a love of the awful to enjoy this to the max funny and incredibly irreverent beyond belief you have to see it to believe it
<START> a still famous but decadent actor morgan freeman has not filmed for four years when he is invited to participate in a new project he asks the clumsy cousin of the director to drop him in a poor latin neighborhood in carlson to research the work of the manager of a small supermarket he sees the gorgeous spanish cashier scarlet paz vega and he becomes attracted with her ability his driver never returns to catch him and scarlet gives a ride to the actor but first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time br br i am a big fan of morgan freeman and paz vega however the pointless 10 items or less is absolutely disappointing this low budget movie does not seem to have a storyline and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of morgan freeman and paz vega and actually nothing happens along 82 minutes the ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous with the character of morgan freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family or was a clash of classes and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be adequate to a simple worker from the lower classes my vote is four br br title brazil um astro em minha vida a star in my life
<START> this movie is using cinematography fantastically the depth of the camera catches each character denzel washington and kevin kline put on awesome performances though washingtons accent does die in certain scenes how is this movie laying forgotten unable to rent nor hire in recent times it threatens to be lost forever a worrying idea attenborough at his best since ghandi this master piece stands for what it should in movies such as these no worrying about gaining audiences rather a cry for freedom in the south african apartheid though critised for the biased nature the movie is faithful to the book by donald woods and faithful to the message intended to express to the world ta and peace
<START> i loved this movie it was all i could do not to break down into tears while watching it but it is really very uplifting i was struck by the performance of ray liotta but especially the talent of tom hulce portraying ray's twin brother who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event but tom's character though heartbreaking knows no self pity and is so full of hope and life this is a great movie don't miss it
<START> with a title borrowed from werner herzog and liberal helpings of kubrick haneke and noe it is painfully obvious that thomas clay considers himself a cut above the usual sort of rubbish our british cinema churns out robert carmichael for short sets itself up as a realistic study of youthful alienation and at the same time seemingly a critique of the iraq war the problem with the realism is that the characters are so patently unrealistic and atypical contrary to the fetid imaginings of extreme filmmakers most teenagers are not drug addled rapists as a critique of the iraq war a film about youth violence by a talented classical musician subtext society has damaged this sensitive individual is so infantile as to hardly bear thinking about there are signs of technical ability but some reviewers have overstated this like kubrick and noe he does show that the desire to shock linked with supposed serious intent may be the worst cinematic con trick of recent film people liked clockwork orange and irreversible because they liked the rapes and the violence but most of all they liked feeling culturally superior for liking things that most hated so too much kubrick and not enough haneke a serious and moral filmmaker here labels this as one of the most moronic films in years i am not against violence in film to do it seriously is a hard trick though people in cinemas cheered alex in clockwork orange showing how kubrick's supposed intent was missed by miles gratuitous violence is much easier to achieve and is less offensive than the pretensions of many art film directors
<START> scary movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films for there is not much of a plot bad acting pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes but and this is a big but there is one good actor one good recurring joke and a good beginning the good actor being tim curry the one good recurring joke is the creepy weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things and the good beginning is the spoof of the excorsist br br the plot to scary movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion but will they survive the night this film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it
<START> this is by far my favorite film of all time that's mainly because it's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics such as spanking and female submissiveness that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch nothing seems to be off limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer however i don't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone sean young turns in an excellent and courageous performance most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it the other cast members do a fine job as well br br have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters have you ever wondered why the obvious reason is that it just doesn't fit today's political atmosphere it seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn that's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn but will not carry a mainstream movie like love crimes sadly even though this movie is only 11 years old it could probably not be made today br br
<START> and this somebody is me and not only me as i can see here at imdb or when leaving the theater why did the people love it it's obvious everybody knows zombies by now at least the horror fans by heart and the others through the dawn of the dead reinvention or resident evil movies etc br br or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies that is until this movie came along and you'll see zombies in a new light perhaps this is not a horror movie although it does contain some violent scenes but is rather a comedy a satire to be precise and it never runs out of steam that is why i rated it so high pacing wise it's incredible the acting is great and the script has no obvious mistakes quite the contrary it's a gem and if you're only a little bit interested in zombies you ought to see it and even if you dislike them watch it because it's a great comedy movie
<START> though frank loesser's songs are some of the finest that broadway has to offer they're bollixed by joseph l mankiewicz' lethargic staging and uninspired presentation when it's over it barely feels like you've watched a musical mankiewicz doesn't seem to know how to present loesser's challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect for example one of the best numbers the showstopping adelaide's lament' concludes by having adelaide vivian blaine belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge and stubby kaye's faux spiritual sit down you're rockin' the boat' has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue adapted from abe burrows' stage book has none of the wit that his films like all about eve' have part of the blame has to go to the leads just about all of whom are miscast marlon brando looks bewildered as to why he's in a musical frank sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential the songs are not tailored to his style and jean simmons barely registers the way a shirley jones might only blaine as the lovelorn showgirl adelaide commands our attention like a broadway pro should the colorful art direction is by joseph wright and howard bristol created the flashy sets
<START> antonioni was aiming for another hip masterpiece this time on the other side of the atlantic than blow up it wasnÂ´t the success with critics and youth like the former though why maybe because it was a europeanÂ´s view of america filled with clichÃ©s that didnÂ´t work then and that have not aged well the revolutionary students at the beginning is embarrassing br br maybe when it was released big blockbuster movies and those aimed specifically at the youth market seemed dated if it had been released a year before maybe hippes in deserts would have seemed fresh itÂ´s a very interesting film tho very beautifully shot with some brilliant and antonionian scenes in between like the love making in the desert the stillness of the desert mansion and the explosive ending that the leads were two amateurs didnÂ´t help they were beautiful but inexperienced mark freshette is slightly better than daria halprin it would have been so much better with proper actors maybe michelle phillips or a young jessica lange the dialog is actually quite funny and poignant at times tho you wouldnÂ´t know the way the lines are delivered br br a very intersting document of the late sixties definitely worth a look for the photography and the soundtrack
<START> the '80's were not very kind to one time major star charles bronson starting with 1982's death wish ii and ending with this truly gruesome film from '89 bronson's screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness d w ii left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of bronson's character's daughter a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail 10 to midnight was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards nothing redeeming about it other films like the evil that men do and the remaining death wish films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge i'm not sure if the producers usually pancho kohner got a kick out of showing a weary looking senior citizen aged bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what but the shoddy craftsmanship and terrible scripts of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated br br kinjite the last of these films is fairly well made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness in this film bronson sodomizes a perverse john forces a pimp to eat his rolex watch allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things i've thankfully forgotten also depicted is the gang rape of a young japanese girl fortunately this was off screen though well implied br br what were people thinking when they made this film what was bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films for anyone interested in his best movies check out most of the films he made in the '60's and '70's like the mechanic death wish from noon til 3 once upon a time in the west red sun the great escape the magnificent seven rider on the rain etc etc
<START> this was one of those times when i had nothing to do with 27 premium movie channels available to me the theory of flight grabbed me and held my interest i found it both touching and amusing a nice combination of feelings i recommend it
<START> this film does a superb job of depicting the plight of an als lou gehrig's disease sufferer the subject is done with compassion as well as humor helena bonham carter is so convincing as a person with als that i found it hard to believe that she was only acting kenneth branagh a superb actor lives up to expectations as the quirky artist who misbehaves and is forced to provide companionship to helena's character as part of his community service an alternative to prison time watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from beginning to end tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances one comes to care deeply for the two of them
<START> incredibly artistic nobody could make them now i think it seem to be perfect the biggest and the greatest musical ever made listen to the beautiful songs the are quite poetry i'm italian and admired by american musical why can't you do something like that now american were the best and for that i absolutely show my devotion to you with this movie there are words to describes the perfection of this movie all of a sudden my heart sings what makes the sunset i fall in love to easily jealousy and the scene with tom and jerry the greatest without reserve if you you doesn't know your eyes are not open my friends you must see it and appreciate wake up
<START> viewing impulse is a very satisfying experience unpredictable films are such a rarity when one comes along like impulse it is something to embrace the script is logical and extremely creative meg tilly tim matheson hume cronyn and bill paxton give believable performances this could have played out like a zombie movie but impulse is far superior to any boring zombiefest and originality shines through in almost every scene you get the feeling that something like this could have actually happened even though the script is pure fiction from the grabber opening till the credits roll you will be fascinated very entertaining and definitely recommended merk
<START> there are so many hollywood movies made now that are not only torture to watch but also have no bearing on anyone's life whatsoever granted movies don't always have to have deep meaning but it's nice to know that there are still film makers out there who care about telling human stories i won't give away the premise of this brilliant film however the screenplay is surely one of the more complex and memorable ones i have ever seen in my life and i'm a 32 year old film buff too bug ranks top ten on my list of favorites which includes on the waterfront sunset boulevard and black narcissus to name just a few this moving movie should become one of your favorites also that is if you have a heart
<START> 1st watched 6 18 2009 Â 2 out of 10 dir pete riski weird psychotic movie about a girl with autism who is being tested in a hospital the power flickers and then all hell breaks loose i'm honestly not sure what the intentions were of the filmmakers on this one what we get for the next 1 hour and a half at least it wasn't longer was a twisted horror twilight zone zombiefest ghost movie that really ended up making no sense at all even to the very end initially after the power goes out everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small group of misfits including the girl and his father there is the typical annoying character a creepy old man and the typical tough guy similar to many scarefests and of course the young girl the main character gets attracted to random stuff starts happening at various times like ghosts and monsters appearing a hinting that time has stopped and dead people as this small group try to escape whatever they're in of course the autistic girl is the center of everything somehow and i really hate how they used this girl's affliction and insinuated that she was the cause and to place it in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame we never really find out the answer to what was going onÂwhich is very strange so please avoid this dog unless you want to be creeped out and confused for one hour and a half this is not for you or any moviegoer what a waste of timeÂreally
