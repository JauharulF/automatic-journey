<START> set in the 70s seed centers around convicted serial killer max seed will sanderson who killed 666 people in 6 years he is sentenced to death but in the electric chair he doesn't die even after being shocked three times br br detective matt bishop michael parÃ© and other officers cover up this secret by burying seed alive seed breaks out and goes after the people who put him in his living coffin br br filmed by the worst director in the world uwe boll seed is nothing more than a snuff film about trying to stretch the envelope of decent society and fails to deliver in any aspect of a storyline and he said this is based on true events because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times they will be set free this is an urban legend and it would never happen much like boll's other abominations alone in the dark for one seed is just utterly horrendous
<START> not a knock on korman as he was very funny on the carol burnett show he was also good at playing secondary characters in mel brooks' movies high anxiety comes to mind he is however not a person who can carry a movie in dueling roles no less this one is basically a gremlins knockoff following a tradition of such movies as critters and ghoulies it is not a very good knockoff either on par with ghoulies but with a much lighter tone to it as it is no where near as dark as that movie got in fact this one is too light and frothy and unfortunately many of the jokes end up falling flat though i did give it a 3 for a score this is only because there is a movie that is even a worse gremlin knockoff if you watched mystery science theater 3000 you know the one i am talking about the infamous hobgoblins this one has a guy finding a little critter in some underground place i only saw this movie once a long time ago so i don't remember everything to clearly and it starts out friendly enough however this creature quickly becomes unfriendly and of course more are spawned and that is the movie more misses than hits in the joke department and it is also really lame to see korman playing the evil brother role best to skip this one but then you may want to check it out just for kicks
<START> this 30 minute documentary buÃ±uel made in the early 1930's about one of spain's poorest regions is in my opinion one of his weakest films first let's admit that 70 years later spain is much richer than it was then and when i say this i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own like excessive individualism and consumerism though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that buÃ±uel favored but with western european style capitalism but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of pi teaching math to poor people the horror buÃ±uel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation what is he proposing that children are taught exactly what at school doesn't buÃ±uel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people
<START> it's nothing more than a weird coincidence that i decided to watch starlift on the 59th anniversary of the day in june 1950 when president truman's ordered us forces into the korean war starlift you see is set largely at travis air force base in california in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in korea but you'd need to do your own research to know this because not once during the film is the name 'korea' mentioned we see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there's no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute america's men in uniform released in december 1951 by warner brothers starlift is a very obvious effort to replicate the success of the studio's star studded world war two home front morale booster hollywood canteen this 1944 crowd pleaser told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in la hoping to get a date with joan leslie but really it was just an excuse for warners to trot out every star under contract from joan crawford john garfield and barbara stanwyck to peter lorre bette davis sydney greenstreet and more starlift features two air force soldiers hoping to meet fictional starlet nell wayne a mask like janice rule and persuading a bunch of warner bros stars to put on a show for the departing troops but in place of crawford garfield et al the best the brothers warner could scrape up in 1951 were doris day ruth roman gordon macrae virginia mayo gene nelson and phil harris with fleeting appearances by james cagney randolph scott and a clearly embarrassed looking gary cooper this threadbare cast whose combined star power would struggle to illuminate a standard lamp is perfectly matched by the crummy production values presumably in an effort to save money several long scenes were shot using really really bad back projection how bad is it you can see the join where the screen meets the floor of the soundstage to describe starlift as a sloppy lazy and third rate movie is to do a disservice to films which are sloppy lazy and third rate it's just terrible avoid it
<START> for me an unsatisfactory unconvincing heist movie with an a list cast particularly the three leads and an experienced maverick director like spike lee i was expecting far more and in the end felt that what was delivered added little to this movie sub genre for a start i didn't like the pacing of the film starting off with mastermind clive owen's raison d'etre piece to camera unnecessarily repeated at the conclusion then finding the narrative peppered with confusing not to say unreal seeming witness interviews then finding yourself jumped into scenes you sense had begun earlier of course the camera work is fluid throughout constantly on the move and incorporating hand camera shots a plenty but director lee fails to deliver thrills or suspense falling down fundamentally by not making anything of the key protagonists in the film denzel washington is weighed down with the clothes and bad ass jive talk of a shaft movie thirty five years earlier he even has that no one understands him but his woman thing going on replete with his hot girlfriend baiting her with some downright crude and inappropriate dirty talk and his mild in the heat of the night riff with willem defoe in almost a bit part raises barely a ripple clive owens plays his character with a resolutely english accent even as we're given to believe the gang is arab based also hindered by having to play 90 of the film with a mask over his face jodie foster delivers another of her patented tight lipped ice maiden sub clarice starling turns as a well connected financial bounty hunter if you will to little effect overall it's a real mish mash of a film with a light but obvious twist at the end in fact the title gives it away from the start spoiler fans worst scene of many is undoubtedly washington's witness interview unbelievably with an 8 year old street kid although owen's dialogue with the same child minutes earlier runs it close in the embarrassment stakes during the film in joke references are made by characters to classic heist films like serpico and dog day afternoon but there's no honour in self praise more like the hot rock instead and even that was good for a few laughs
<START> although cinderella isn't the obvious choice for a sequel i love jaq and gus so i didn't hesitate the format of the mice writing a book for cinderella was an inspired one i enjoy writing stories myself and hope children will be encouraged by this the three stories are cute amusing although the songs were forgettable jaq and gus were my favourite characters but i also enjoyed seeing lucifer bruno the mice chorus and all the rest pom pom proved the perfect companion for lucifer and i liked the governess a sequel done right for a change my rating 8 10
<START> only on a very rare occasion does an episode of the x files fail to generate any excitement or does the episode contain anything which is just totally boring to watch a detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances the deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths took place mulder has devised a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has come back reincarnated as the little girl and is exacting revenge now for the bizarre bit the little girl has no connection at all and seems to just a random person chosen as the reincarnation i think this was slightly lazy writing by the writers and this episode ranks as one of the worst in x files history
<START> pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other that's it for about 5 minutes we see this it's shot in black and white with tons of half naked men running around slapping each other to the tune of dreadful music it looks interesting but there's no plot and really the violence inherent in this got disturbing also the homo eroticism in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea some people who like avant garde material might like this but i found it incomprehensible boring stupid and ocassionally disturbing really what is the point in all this i saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence i really wish i could go lower than 1
<START> a group of hunters track down a werewolf kill it decapitate it and then sell the head to unethical dr atwill played by director writer tim sullivan who runs a private clinic specializing in corneal transplants research chemist rich stevens mark sawyer whose eyes were destroyed when acid flew into his face during a lab explosion is the unlucky recipient of the werewolf's eyeballs it takes awhile to get to the first full moon so first we get a tender love story between rich and his compassionate big breasted nurse sondra gard stephanie beaton sondra is so compassionate that she strips off her clothing and starts riding rich in bed before he even has a chance to remove his bandages after a month in the hospital rich returns home to icy wife rita deborah huber who promptly tells him you look pretty ugly before speeding off in her kia our hero soon discovers that rita is not only a bitch but an adulterous skank who's been carrying on an affair with his supposed friend craig lyndon johnson finally the full moon rises and rich finds himself in a hairy predicament as he transforms into a very silly looking werewolf creature predictable carnage ensues br br after ripping out craig's throat on a beach rich wakes up in the brush the next morning with his clothes tattered and vague recollections of the evening's events he makes friends with dwarf psychic occult expert andros kurt levi and is hassled by both local author siodmak jason clark and lesbian police detective in a pants suit justine evers tarri markel when rich confronts dr atwill the doctor sends his sadistic bald henchman kass eric mestressat who gets a kick out of dismembering corpses with a machete at the clinic after him with help from sondra rich manages to escape sondra takes him back to her place and basically rapes him on the couch during an overlong sex scene that lasts about five minutes will rich be able to control his lycanthropy or find a cure for it before he claims more victims br br shot on the cheap with a camcorder this homemade werewolf flick has a somewhat unique premise with the eye transplant angle but trots out clichÃ© after clichÃ© otherwise the sets are sub porn level the clinic scenes seem to have been filmed inside someone's home or apartment the wolf transformation scenes don't even look as good as the time lapse photography used way back in the 1940s instead they employ ragged editing throw some hair on the actor cut throw on some more on cut more fur and fill his mouth full of white gunk he can spit out cut no need to worry about continuity there's no fade no dissolve nothing it's pretty sloppy once fully transformed the werewolf costume designed by jeff leroy who also edited and shot the movie is pretty awful it has red glowing christmas bulb eyes fur that looks like shag carpet and a plastic face that's almost completely immobile there are several times you can see the cameraman's fingers in front of the camera lens and does the moon really stay full five nights in a row as far as the cast is concerned they're amateurish but tolerable and as far as b horror flicks are concerned there are worse out there this one is paced fairly well is only 70 minutes long and does provide plenty of the red stuff during the attack scenes as well as the aforementioned t a from ms beaton br br it was produced by david s sterling camp blood who was one of the first to ride the wave of digital video right when it was first starting to dominate the low budget independent horror genre scene back in the mid late 90s many of his notoriously awful productions were released by brain damage films a label to avoid like the plague for the most part fx guy jeff leroy who is listed as co director here at imdb but not in the film's actual credits and vinnie bilancio who appears in a small role as one of the hunters went on to make the much more fun and polished exploitation flick werewolf in a women's prison in 2006 which had a similar looking creature on display red glowing eyes and all
<START> stupid mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes piloted by burgess meredith chasing a porsche race car which runs on decades old gasoline sludge driven by lee majors with chris makepeace as the runaway techno wiz who can mcgyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society as moronic as it sounds terrible waste of burgess meredith but chris makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film
<START> i saw this at the theater in the early 1970's the most memorable and scary scene is when the german army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time the germans and their horses are covered from head to toe or hoof with eerie protective suits the experienced british soldiers don gas masks only and once again await the clouds of gas and the german attackers the gas clouds move ever closer finally enveloping the british defenders the germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb suddenly a scream from the defenders this gas is like no other that they have experienced before br br now you will know why i have remembered this scene for the last 30 years and still shiver i think that you will too
<START> this is the worst piece of crap i have seen recently there is nothing good about this movie the plot is plain stupid dialogs don't make any sense humorous scenes never heard anything about the real humor actors just don't play the worse they don't even try the script itself is somewhat which is in the same league with ed wood and uwe boll there is only one good thing in this flick the fights they are well choreographed as one would expect of the hong kong guys and are the only reason to watch prince of the sun although i believe the fights are just supposed to fill the empty space so that the screenwriter didn't have to bother thinking about the storyline however this weak and absurd plot may prevent you from watching it to the end avoid it unless you are fan of the dragon lady cynthia rothrock
<START> its christmas eve and lazy and submissive housewife della kim basinger receives some violent threats from her troubled and abusive husband leaving her twin children in bed she ventures off into the night for one last shopping spree at the local mall its busy there and finding a parking space is nigh on impossible della takes umbrage at one motorist who parks in two spaces she leaves them a note saying as much returning to her car after visiting the shops she is confronted by some yobs yup the owners of the car she left a note on they are very angry and want some fun with her a kindly security guard steps into assist her but things get out of hand and the guard is shot della flees with the now murderous yobs in hot pursuit they shoot at her she looses control of her car and crashes quickly grabbing her toolbox from the trunk she hides in a deserted building site but is soon caught just before they try to rape and kill her from her magical toolbox she produces a wrench wounding their leader chuckie she manages to escape again into the nearby woods in the fracas one of the gang is killed it just happens to be the black guy here the night gets worse for all involved as a deadly game of cat and mouse ensues a similar plot line to eden lake drew me to this but that is where the comparisons end this is a brainless and dumb film shockingly scripted and horribly acted by all involved the doe eyed disney esquire twin kids are horrible to watch but its lukas haas as chuckie that must take the plaudits in the bad acting department although he is given a run for his money by the equally awful husband as a film its plot line is completely telegraphed all the way through even in the set up early on della's cell phone goes dead and then in the shops her credit card has been cancelled by her hubby and she has no cash and its christmas eve now where could they be going with this i wonder the only surprising part of this hit is when after killing all the clichÃ©d bad guys with the contents of her magic toolbox she demands chuckie to f ck her if my jaw had not already been on the floor at this films awfulness it would surely have dropped and smashed on the floor even the ending is messed up all the feminist grannies wanting their pound of flesh are left utterly disappointed i didn't think i could be further disappointed but then i saw that guillermo del toro produced this dreck
<START> the muppets take manhattan is different in a lot of ways to every other muppet movie made so far for one it remains the only muppet film not owned by disney as of 2008 the film still belongs to 20th century fox cbs fox at the time of its release even though disney owns the rights to the muppets also this film has a story line that's very non linear and events that are otherwise unpredictable br br of course it's very hard to beat the original muppet movie from 1979 especially since that movie had more memorable songs than manhattan does however one way in which the muppets take manhattan is better than the muppet movie is perhaps the surprisingly realistic scenarios in the first movie all the muppets really have to do is go to hollywood walk into an agent's office and they are immediately given a rich famous contract in this movie the muppets learn that they actually have to work for their desired success and it's a lot harder to do that especially in the entertainment business than they initially thought that's an important and often times overlooked message provided one is willing to suspend the disbelief that the muppets being small and made of cloth don't necessarily have to live in a spacious place or even eat respectively above all their struggle to make it after graduating college creates a very good story another note the celebrity cameos in the movie were cool and they surprisingly managed not to take away the spotlight from the muppets that ability right there is a testament to henson and how appealing the muppet characters were even to adults br br where manhattan falls flat and this is where i'm sure people will disagree with me is with some of the key songs especially in the end i thought the wedding song he'll make me happy was too somber for such a happy occasion as a wedding it sounded more like a song that's played at a funeral every time i watch this movie hearing that song makes me unusually depressed especially when the film begins on such an upbeat number as together again and ends happily for that matter saying goodbye was a sad number too but it fit better into the movie because the muppets were disbanding and weren't sure they were going to see each other again that last song was such a let down and perhaps even added to younger viewers' misery of seeing their favorite muppets leave the big screen br br the muppets take manhattan is overall a good film and one that marches to the beat of a different drum than the other muppet films including the newer ones made after the deaths of jim henson and richard hunt fortunately the film marches in the same direction as well i just wished the film ended on a better song that wasn't quite so melancholy plus disney should have gotten its hands on this film's copyright and given it a proper dvd release maybe it will someday we'll see
<START> this movie starts out very very slow but when the action finally gets started it's a little had to follow i couldn't understand why some of the events were taking place and a lot of events happened before they were explained making them sort of confusing the only thing it really has going for it is the massive amount of blood gore it has although most times the special effects are lacking blood looks like red kool aid skin tearing sounds like somebody is stepping on a pile of sticks again the story has a sort of amateur feel to it like the writer didn't take a long time to perfect it i feel like it could be a much better movie if the effects were done better and more time was taken on the script i honestly wish i hadn't watched it not because of the gore but because i feel that i wasted 90 minutes of my life if you like extremely gory movies this is for you if not stay away
<START> this is the first of these 8 films to die for collection that i've seen and it's certainly not made me want to see any of the rest although i've heard at least a couple of them are decent i don't know this wasn't terrible but it didn't really do much for me your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in suburbia kind of thing mom dad died the family sold the farm moved to san francisco where they continued to bring home stray food sources whenever possible the best part of this was the creepy goth sister who of course invites a friend over from school that never leaves anyway of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on and so on this family is sort of like the white bread version of the sawyer clan they're nasty they do bad things but they ain't go no soul i see a lot of reviews from people that liked this and i guess i don't know what i missed but i found it to be very mediocre i wouldn't recommend it to anyone really 4 out of 10
<START> there were a lot of things going against this movie for me before i watched it br br first i was a typical high school senior in a shakespeare class i didn't really even like much less understood half of shakespeare would be no more than unintelligible without me pouring all my concentration into his almost encrypted plays encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language and then i still wouldn't get most of it br br second it was 4 hours long i never thought that could be a good thing br br well let me tell you something this movie was so masterful so beautiful i actually understood all the language as it was being performed now the script was followed to the letter in this movie the same script that was incomprehensible to me in shakespeare class and here i was my mind opening and me understanding it i was doubting myself while watching the movie almost but lo and behold when performed and only then shakespeare comes to life so this version of hamlet showed me that shakespeare is indeed a master who wrote great stories when i saw it on the big screen especially in the high budget major motion picture style with beautiful cinematography and photography and acted amazingly by brannagh and cast somehow i understood what was going on what was being said the language is awesome and passionate it allows for more raw emotion when words can't describe something maybe shakespeare's words can br br i still hold to this day that fist of the north star animated english dub is the greatest movie ever made no movie provides more sheer entertainment but for a movie to come close to dethroning fist from that position which hamlet did it came close is truly amazing awe inspiring it wasn't a movie it was an event br br even more amazing it made me appreciate shakespeare wow powerful powerful is the word one of the rare truly powerful movies out there br br this gets 2 hundred trillion stars out of infinity stars yes yes br br by the way all you kids out there in a shakespeare class forget it you're wasting you're time you have to see the plays performed only then will justice be done to them
<START> there seem to have been any number of films like this released during the 70's and the fact that i cannot recollect the title to a single one of them off hand is a measure of their impact these are what novelists would call 'pot boilers' they are scarcely more than a vehicle for keeping movie stars in the public eye br br we have micheal caine peter ustinov omar sharif rex harrison and william holden more than enough names to get bums on cinema seats every taste in hero is catered for though one suspects that most of the audience still went away disappointed br br their talents are simply thrown away and i wonder that stars with so much money and such reputation can be yet so desperate or lacking in good sense this sort of movie hardly adds gilding to a cv sometimes maybe actors should choose their director instead of the other way round br br it was pretty obvious that it would be crap even from the outset that ludicrously mismatched jaunty jazz theme music which also percolated up every time some incidental noise is needed had all the atmospheric conviction of elevator muzak who imagined employing a jazz band when a scene depicted the steamy jungles of central africa or the endless sahara with camels and palms as a backdrop definitely a serious goof ball ennio morricone would have known what to do and his results would have oozed enough atmosphere and tension to raise my rating a good two points this director should have taken the trouble to watch 'lawrence of arabia' or even sergio leone's westerns he might have learnt a few things but then again probably he wouldn't br br alfred hitchcock played the disappearing wife theme to good effect in his film 'frantic' it was later remade with equal panache staring harrison ford in each case the confusion surrounding her loss and the tension of the chase was tangible here when michael caine might be otherwise compelled to employ a little brain and bravado rex harrison kept popping up out of no where like some wily old genii to put him back on track whenever the narrative stumbled br br at least the photography was rather good with excellent use of the often beautiful environment but then the dumb music must pipe up and blow to atoms what little ambiance this created br br action scenes were also contrived and stilted with such ineptly choreographed fight sequences that they might have been staged in a first year drama class and of course the players must fight to a jazz accompaniment as you do br br and that's about as much comment as this item deserves except to say that the script was pretty wretched as well br br stick with your hobby on this one even if it contained your favourite movie stars you're sure to be disappointed too
<START> apparently the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so called movie they described blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence i saw no intrigue i instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie i saw no violence at least i saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with impervious skin but here i am perhaps revealing too much of the plot furthermore as a viewer of many and sundry films some of which include the occasional kung fu movie i can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable whatever you may choose to do i will always remain br br correct br br jonathan tanner br br br br p s i was not blinded by the choreography
<START> despite louis b mayer reportedly not being interested in signing the young greta garbo to a contract this first american and mgm film for the actress looked quite beautiful it's obvious that the film was assigned some amazing talent to film the production and make matte paintings as it has all the nice polish and artfulness you'd expect from the best pictures the studio could produce it simply looks beautiful even 84 years later br br as for garbo herself like her other very early american films she too looks different while she's quite recognizable her makeup is much softer than it would become just a year later giving her a less severe look and a gentleness about her you just didn't see in subsequent films i kind of wish they'd kept this look but considering how famous she'd become with the trademark look who am i to say they shouldn't have gone that route the film is about garbo and how she and her family are unfairly forced off their land by the landlord while the landlady the much esteemed doÃ±a bernarda claims it's because the bank has demanded payment it's because her son has fallen for garbo and what better way to get rid of her than to force them out on the streets nice lady huh years pass and by now garbo has become a new singing sensation who is world famous when she returns to her hometown years later her old boyfriend who had promised to marry her but wimped out when his mother doÃ±a bernarda refused to allow it sees her his new love for another lady is now tested will he be content to marry this lady who is the heir to a huge pig fortune or will he want his old flame and more importantly will garbo even take him back after he behaved so spinelessly in the meantime a huge rainstorm hits the land begins to flood and homes soon are being washed away by the deluge cortez and a friend make a mad dash as the dam breaks in a scene where they obviously superimposed his row boat over the cascading stream he eventually makes it out alive and to the home where garbo is now staying she welcomes them inside and they stay with her until the storm passes then he admits that he still loves her and had braved the storm to make sure that she was safe she tells him to get lost next you see ricardo about to get married to his second choice the daughter of the pork king he obviously has little enthusiasm for this and you feel sorry for the lady as she did nothing wrong soon cortez is seen wandering back to garbo's home he's love sick and needs her in this scene garbo is quite luminous and can't tell him to leave as they dissolve in each other's arms once again he tells her of his love for her br br when doÃ±a bernarda learns of this she is not pleased evidently a pork queen is a better catch than an internationally known singer because of the meddling of this nasty old lady garbo leaves unwilling to come between the mother and her wimpy son but cortez comes running announcing he must have her and won't rest until he has her as his wife moments after making this proclamation a family friend talks to cortez and convinces him to give her up for the good of his career and reputation so much for won't rest until he has her for his wife huh despite cortez being a wimp through and through for some reason she cannot bring herself to hate him and so he marries the pork queen and lives a very dull life when years later garbo meets cortez again he is a dull looking middle aged man while she is as beautiful as ever and not surprisingly she tells him once again to get lost br br at the time this film was made garbo was not a star in the us and cortez was so in light of this it's surprising they gave cortez such an unlikable character to play instead of the usual confident valentino like role they'd been giving him here he is an indecisive wimp a huge wimp and from here on his career was on a slow downward spiral as for garbo the role helped establish her as a big star as she was the focus of the film and played a character much like her later personas br br as for the film the new music composed for it was very nice though a tad repetitive the print oddly was nearly perfect throughout except for the intertitle cards which could use some restoration br br a most enjoyable film expertly constructed wistful and worth seeing and for one of the few times i can think of it i have no real complaints in this excellent film
