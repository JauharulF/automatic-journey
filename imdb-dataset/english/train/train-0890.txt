<START> this romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day a wealthy upper class english woman schemes plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction she uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti social kind there's a clever sex role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters but naturally there's a tall dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man br br the wishy washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme but those who thirst for romance will overlook that
<START> hunters chase what they think is a man through the forest though the audience sees he is a werewolf the hunters never seem to realize this because after they shoot him he looks normal when they decapitate him br br a doctor transplants the werewolf's eyes into a man who lost his own in a laboratory experiment the man rich gets to have sex with his nurse stephanie beaton before he even gets his bandages removed br br after he leaves the hospital he finds his wife has been cheating on him too when a smoke machine sends clouds past an amateur painting of a moon with a fake tree branch on the foreground he turns into a werewolf his torso grows larger splitting his shirt and he grows a giant werewolf mask on his head that has red lights in the eyes his pants stay intact the mouth chews unconvincingly though some sort of robotics or hidden hands in the eyebrows give him a baleful look at times br br despite the poor werewolf costume there is a fair amount of blood and gore and those are fairly well done there's even a pretty good decapitation later in the movie however when a man falls from a height a rather bad dummy does the job br br rich has a friend named siodmak who is some sort of occult expert and he also accidentally stumbles across a small man with crutches named androse who is also such an expert they try to help him a little br br rich kills people who have done him wrong a policewoman investigates the murders and tries to hit on beaton who doesn't much care for lesbian scenes so nothing comes of it br br quite cheap but between the nudity and blood and gore and a not terrible story combining sort of the most dangerous game with the hands of orlac and the wolf man it's somewhat entertaining available on its own or in the box set scream queens vol 1
<START> having enjoyed jean arthur in the devil and miss jones my interest was peaked so i tried sitting through this second string screwball outing about an investigation into the death of a jockey but i didn't make it to the end arthur photographed in a gauzy movie magazine fashion either wants alimony from ex husband william powell or another shot at marriage but i never felt for her because the character is just a string of wisecracks she's the type of heroine prone to comical curiousness but once inside a morgue like all women in these '30's comedies she faints william powell reportedly had a high time working with miss arthur but you'd never know it from the end result they look awkward standing next to each other hesitant over their banter the actor playing powell's valet is excruciating and the pauses for viewer laughs are pregnant with unease
<START> this is the worst movie i have seen for years it starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way i thnik when is something going to happen in this film and the the acting is worse the ending lifts it a bit and saves the movie from a total flop mark wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie sorry tim burton batman was good but this one sucks
<START> i came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better instead of what should be a gripping tense story of a boy's fight for survival in the wilderness it comes off as a national geographic documentary meets columbia sportswear ad br br the film begins with brian jared rushton preparing for a journey by plane to see his father his mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a going away gift what's wrong with a rubik's cube little knowing how badly he will soon need it once in the air the plane's pilot a blink and you'll miss him cameo by ned beatty suffers a fatal heart attack leaving brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake extremely lucky to walk or rather swim away virtually unscathed brian must find shelter food and hope for rescue br br here is where the main problem with the movie begins by the very nature of brian's solitude jared has very few lines to speak and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene instead he is shown walking around sitting around and so on with only a minimal sense of danger as a result too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents' troubled marriage as the source of tension these scenes merely get in the way and don't particularly add much to the story even worse occasionally jared Â his face covered with mud lets out a primal scream or two which conjures up unfortunate parallels to predator ' speaking of unfortunate we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet but it presumably helped keep him warm at night br br another disappointment is pamela sue martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother both she and the father have very little impact in the movie for instance we are never shown how they react to news of brian's disappearance how they might be organizing rescue attempts and so on this is just one source of tension the film makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before brian embarked on his journey
<START> barman directed any way the wind blows as he would sing a deus song anarchy rules over a logical and common strain of thoughts the story behind this movie just goes any which way the wind blows and that can truly be refreshing to watch if you are prepared and willing that is viewers who state that there is nothing to keep the story lines together are right who the hell is that windman anyway still i really enjoyed this movie antwerp is a beautiful bustling happening place and any way captures that feeling it also captures the silliness the racism the bureaucracy the addictions and the violence that survives undetected in a seemingly friendly city the movie is entertaining funny and a little shallow barman's screen debut will not make as heavy an impact as his music debut in that light some might be disappointed but then again 'worst case scenario' would be a subtle subtitle for any way the wind blows
<START> this one came out during the western genreâs last gasp unfortunately it emerges to be a very minor and altogether unsatisfactory effort â even if made by and with veterans in the field to begin with the plot offers nothing remotely new james coburn escapes from a chain gang intent on killing the man now retired who put him there â charlton heston while the latter lays a trap for him coburn outwits heston by kidnapping his daughter barbara hershey naturally the former lawman â accompanied by hersheyâs greenhorn fiancÃ© chris mitchum â sets out in pursuit of coburn and his followers all of whom broke jail along with him br br rather than handling the proceedings in his customary sub fordian style mclaglen goes for a sam peckinpah approach â with which heâs never fully at ease repellent characters plenty of violence and the sexual tension generated by hersheyâs presence among coburnâs lusty bunch incidentally heston and coburn had previously appeared together in a sam peckinpah western â the troubled major dundee 1965 i really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on dvd though i recently taped the theatrical version in pan and scan format off tcm uk anyway the film is too generic to yield the elegiac mood it clearly strives for suggested also by the title then again both stars had already paid a fitting valediction to this most american of genres â will penny 1968 for heston and coburn with pat garrett billy the kid 1973 br br at least though heston maintains a modicum of dignity here â his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of half breed coburn by anticipating what his next move will be the latter however tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing heston to witness his associatesâ gang rape of hershey apart from the latter this lengthy sequence sees heston try to fool coburn with a trick borrowed from his own el cid 1961 the villainous gang is then trapped inside a bushfire ignited by the practiced heston and the violent death of the two âobsoleteâ protagonists as was his fashion hestonâs demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice br br the supporting cast includes michael parks as the ineffectual town sheriff jorge rivero as coburnâs mexican lieutenant and larry wilcox â of the tv series chips â as the youngest member of coburnâs gang whoâs assigned the task of watching over hershey while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away jerry goldsmith contributes a flavorful but at the same time unremarkable score
<START> may contain spoilers br br if living on tokyo time were some bold experiment where real life wanna be actors were given film parts on the condition that they would be required to take a combination of powerful prescription anti anxiety anti depression and anti psychotic medications this is the classic psych ward combo that renders patients into drooling zombies all during filming then this movie would hold far more interest or if the film production was another type of experiment where all of the actors were sleep deprived before and during filming then tokyo time could be more easily explained br br as it is this film is filled with lifeless low energy actors in the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking with his sister it appeared that he was having trouble keeping his eyes open in almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting down with every part of his body motionless from beginning to end his facial expression is best described as near sleep br br fret not about the actors speaking over each other's lines because these actors can barely finish droning out any lines of dialog everyone speaks with a depressing monotone voice no laughing no yelling no vigor no one has energy enough to crack a smile the result complete and total boredom br br and it does not help matters that the direction is simple and amateurish br br avoid this lifeless film at all costs better to watch greencard which has a similar plot and has charm and energy or for an unconventional japanese romance story check out the long vacation which has an ample amount of everything living on tokyo time does not
<START> yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award material but then it doesn't try to be anything it is not a fun filled romp with real funny one liners a stellar and very funny performance by peter o'toole a grounding and down to earth performance from joan plowright the band's performance was on the spot each one playing their role in a deft comical manner the music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely from some of the negative comments i deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads a good example is the comment about the strange baseball like game well my dear american that was cricket from which baseball is derived and the explaining of it to the ignorant us band was very funny for those that do know cricket also no you were not supposed to wince when carl broke a window it was funny how lord foxley said oh yes to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time oh no also referring to the money jeez it seems that every joke must be explained to some people all in all i enjoyed it and had some great laughs well worth seeing
<START> i am a jane eyre lover and a purist and this version includes almost all of the important details of the book and the characters are portrayed as i imagined them jane eyre is a complex story of great richness and can't be delivered properly in a feature length format so it needs a tv mini series timothy dalton's rochester is probably the best ever there has been a lot of discussion about how attractive he is and his age in the book jane the narrator describes him as about 35 and not young but not yet middle aged i think timothy dalton was about 38 when he made this so that is about right also we only have jane's opinion of whether rochester is handsome she only just met him and he asks her bluntly what she thinks as an inexperienced and humble girl i can't imagine her saying she did think him handsome the actor playing rochester needs to show us the character of the man and this is fulfilled to perfection i love the relationship between the two leads which is the crucial thing about this story and the humour of their encounters other versions have blown it but this gets it right the 2006 version with toby stephens aged 37 years is in progress on bbc1 and is very good indeed so i will decide whether that is my favourite when it is completed br br on viewing this series again after watching the 2006 version i have decided that this version with timothy dalton and zelah clark is the best charlotte bronte's dialogue is preserved and this is essential to the power of the story modernisation just doesn't work it's a victorian story and having archaic poetic speech suits the characters this version has an excellent cast zelah clark is tiny and the difference in height between her and rochester is important timothy dalton has real presence and is an amazing actor there are no extra scenes to divert from the plot and the screenplay includes all the essential scenes but leaves out unnecessary details making it to the point and gripping i recommend it to all true jane eyre fans
<START> there's no denying the first azumi film was a commercial product it was an adaptation of a popular manga and had cast of young attractive actors and certainly wasn't lacking in the budget department yet it more than entertained for what it was and i can't deny i enjoyed it immensely br br azumi 2 lacks just about everything that made the original so wonderful the first thing that should set alarm bells ringing is the absence of the superb ryuhei kitamura at the helm with him he seemed to take not only his own visual flair and kinetics but the originals style beauty and most importantly its heart while the first had a simple hitlist plot this one has a corkscrew mess of a story with too many dull characters stabbing each other in the back so many times the potential for any sympathy or pathos is obliterated gone is the effective interplay between the lead characters azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a bunch of stroppy teenagers arguing in a forest characterisation is non existent if anyone watching actually cares who lives and who dies i'll be shocked the same applies to the villains here the final battle in fact all the battles are completely devoid of any sort of tension the fact that they are poorly choreographed and abysmally directed not to mention few and far between is made a sideline by their own sheer pointlessness the villains themselves try far too hard to be campy and even if they were all combined they don't come within a country mile of the pete burnsian antics of jo odagiri in the original br br major spoiler at end of paragraph br br aya ueto tries her best it has to be said and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films azumi is now a fully fledged assassin meaning she can wave her sword around in slow motion unfortunately now the character is instilled with a sort of man with no name style mysteriousness ueto's model looks become even more inappropriate i know this is supposed to be the point but this combined with the ineffectiveness of everyone else in the film the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptness of the film in general means it is downright impossible to get behind her character this time around the less said about chiaki remember me from kill bill kuriyama's performance the better it suffices to say her turn from good to evil is about as subtle as napalm br br overall this was just a colossal disappointment any merits is does have were done ten times better in the first film a lazy unsatisfying and generally downright boring mess
<START> every new fall line up show deserves at least my 3 strikes and you're out policy i give a comedy 3 chances to make me laugh that is 3 complete episodes after episode 1 i actually said to the tv cancelled tomorrow it was that bad i have now watched the first 4 episodes of cavemen and have yet to manage even a smirk not a titter a guffaw a chortle as a matter of fact no facial movement at all i will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode because i am convinced that i am clearly missing something in this show i'm simply not getting it but i believe that a comedy on a major tv network in prime time just has to be funny but there are no laughs from me yet there's just no way that abc would put on the least funniest comedy of all time at 8 00 p m i know there has got to be an inside joke that just isn't jiving with my brain i've read each of the previous comments i get the social aspect of it but where are the jokes i shall continue suffering for at least 30 minutes a week until i have a light bulb moment and smack myself in the head shouting eureka
<START> this film opened to poor showings in the first few weeks then meena kumari died and it just brought the crowds rolling in songs on all india radio especially inhi logon ne were played so often that i was sick of them at the time despite recognising their beauty br br yes it did take all those years to make this was because the marriage was a very unhappy one and kamal amrohi also had difficulty finding the money to make the film looking at the sumptous sets and costumes not surprising not only does meena kumari age and fall ill but listen carefully to lata's voice inhi logon ne has her 50's younger voice while songs that were re recorded like chalo dildar chalo show clear development i only wish someone would find the ghulam mohammad songs that weren't included in the film because of changing fashions that called for fewer though slightly songs and publish them lata in a recent interview 2007 rated ghulam mohammad as one of the best composers she had ever worked with apart from madan mohan a great personal friend notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the chalo dildar songs very unusual there is only a brief shot of raj kumar from the middle distance and you only see the back of the supposed meena kumari kamal amrohi made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and moon any other film this song would have had close ups of both of them br br as for this being the finest film ever i would beg to differ it means you have missed a lot of indian cinema in no particular order films like barsaat old devdas older versions bandini do bigha zameen garam hava dastak guddi aan pyasa kagaz ke phool sahib bibi aur ghulam kabuliwallah abhimaan guide sujatha bombay ka babu daag parineeta old umrao jaan etc etc and if you valued music more than story the list would simply grow with beautiful scores from barsat ki raat to naya daur teesri manzil mahal aag jugnu anand mera naam joker the list is really endless br br so enjoy pakeezah but don't miss out on any of the above
<START> i have seen slaughter high several times over the years and always found it was an enjoyable slasher flick with an odd sense of humor but i never knew that it was filmed in the uk and i never knew that the actor that plays marty rantzen simon scuddamore committed suicide after the film was released i guess i did notice while watching it last night that the actors phrasing seems rather odd for americans and a few of them aren't very good at hiding their english accents br br all that aside though this is the tale of the class nerd marty who is the butt of jokes from his classmates and on one particular day april fools day he's lured into the girl's locker room by one caroline munro yes playing a teenager and humiliated big time on film of course the coach catches the gang at work they're all given a vigorous workout to punish them but not before a couple of the guys slip marty a joint which he tries to smoke in the chemistry lab but it's full of something that makes him sick when he runs to the restroom one of his classmates slips in and puts a chemical that reacts with something marty is mixing which results in a fire and the spill of a bottle of nitric acid which leaves poor marty burned horribly scarred br br ten years later this same gang is headed for their class reunion at good old doddsville high which seems oddly boarded up and inaccessible but thanks to ingenuity they manage to get in and find the place seemingly derelict except there's a room where a banquet and liquor is laid out and so of course they eat drink and be merry for soon they will die of course br br the gang is stalked one by one by a figure in a jester's mask but could it be marty they don't know they figure he's either in a loony bin or working for ibm they're not sure which but whoever it is he's making quick work of them particularly nasty is the girl that takes a bath to wash blood off her from one of her classmates whose innards popped all over her when he drank poisoned beer she is victim to an acid bath which i believe may have been one of the parts originally cut in the tape version because it seemed extra nasty when i watched it this time i could be wrong but i believe that wasn't on the tape br br at any rate there's somewhat of a twist ending and that also contains footage not on the tape i believe there's also a bit of frontal nudity early on that was also excised but apart from that i didn't really notice if there were other bits on this uncut version probably so but it's been a while since i've last seen it br br at any rate if you're a fan of 80's slasher flicks then snap up the new release dvd because it's a fun little slasher with a good atmosphere feel to it 7 out of 10
<START> buffs of the adult western that flourished in the 1950s try and trace its origins to the film that kicked off the syndrome of course we can go back to howard hawks's red river 1948 or further still to john ford's my darling clementine 1946 but if we want to stick with this single decade then it has to be one of a couple of films made in that era's initial year one is the gunfighter an exquisitely grim tale of a famed gunslinger ringo facing his last shootout another from that same year is winchester '73 and it's worth noting that millard mitchell appears in both as grim mustached highly realistic range riders in the gunfighter he's the town marshal expected to arrest ringo but once rode with him in an outlaw gang in winchester he's the sidekick to jimmy stewart a kind of horatio to stewart's hamlet in this epic tragic tale the plot is simple enough stewart's lonesome cowpoke wins a remarkable winchester in a shooting match beating the meanest man in the west stephen mcnally who is actually his own brother and caused the death of their father when the brother steals the gun stewart and mitchell go after him in a cowboy odyssey that takes them all across the frontier meeting up with both outlaws and indians in one wonderful bit two future stars rock hudson and tony curtis play an indian chief and a u s cavalry soldier during a well staged pitched battle dan duryea steals the whole show as a giggling outlaw leader while shelly winters just before she began to gain weight is fine as the shady lady who ties all the plots together today filmmakers would go on for about four hours to bring such an ambitious idea to the screen but anthony mann does so in an extremely economical amount of time with not a minute wasted such western legends as bat masterson and wyatt earp terrifically played by will geer make brief appearances adding to the historicity as well as the epic nature the final battle between good and bad brothers high atop a series of jutting rock canyons is now legendary among western buffs it's also worth noting that stewart however much associated he became with western films does what is actually his first western leading man role here yes he was in destry rides again eleven years earlier but was cast in that comedy spoof because he seemed so wrong for westerns
<START> this is a terrible film and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotion the characters are uninflected obviously drawn predictable and the story line is obvious and typical hollywood wish fulfillment br br william holden so sad to see him in this role was 55 when this film was made but he's playing someone in his early 40s and looks like he's in his 60s kay lenz was 20 and was scripted to find him irresistibly attractive i think the dog they found by the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection br br holden's character the same age as clint eastwood when he directed this film not coincidentally is placed with obvious trappings of 60s pre hippie cool the bachelor pad the swinging hi fi the lunches at yamashiro but the film is ridiculously uncool a clanging claptrap of old fogies desperately wishing that the free spirits they saw on sunset and in laurel canyon would find them and their big honkin' cars sexy br br ugh youth culture was never that desperate and i shudder to think that bill holden was so desperate for youth that he took this embarrassing part
<START> this was probably one of the most well made films of the 40's warner bros at the very height of their style the photography by sol polito is arguably his finest achievement gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing max steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores the epitome of his classical leit motif method the music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable it's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make now voyager later that year a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite ciefly because it starred bette davis in my opinion the gay sisters is a much better film better made in all departments and more interesting complex and enjoyable a most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper critical perfection each thing has to be judged in it's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms most of the complaints i've read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point if you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon don't go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry the art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population sorry folks maybe if this movie had had a score by the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots you'd all be gleefully gratified i'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week
<START> if you have beloved actors peter falk rip torn george segal and bill cobbs you don't need billy burke coolio or any other distractions massive talent is totally wasted in three days to vegas with the blame falling squarely on the script my neighbor's vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie if you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script check out the crew there really are no redeeming factors here and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime i wanted to like it but the shallow script cheats the audience by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with merk
