<START> knowing how old a film is ought to prepare the viewer for a few things and with those things in mind perhaps the movie'll be more tolerable so it was when i watched revolt of the zombies the heavy reliance on tedious dialogue and corny movements should be expected as should the primitiveness or absence of special effects in those days a great deal is asked from the imagination of the onlooker maybe too much in this case and the plot isn't easy to follow some zombiefied southeast asian soldiers in wwi performed very admirably although skeptical as to why if true the explanation should stay out of the wrong hands so off goes a group to archaeologically investigate the key to long distance hypnosis is learned by a member of the expedition who uses it to among other purposes temporarily dispense with the beau of the gal for whom he has the hots to prove his love for her he gives up his hold on everybody which he shouldn't have done 'cause once they're all unzombiefied many want to kill him so that he'll never control them again below average even with precautionary forethought recommended for only the extremely patient
<START> having seen the hot eliza dushku in the pretty good wrong turn i decided to pick this one up instead of return of the living dead of all movies haven't seen that one yet but considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever safe to say i made the wrong choice there is simply nothing to recommend this movie and i am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut it didn't even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like i know what you did last summer or valentine or urban legend it simply made no sense held no excitement had very little interesting acting or compelling writing the release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running and the reason is obvious the whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly to meaningless effect get wrong turn instead if you want to see dushku i would like to see a movie with her and the super hot elisabeth harnois but i don't think even that would have made this movie watchable casey affleck so promising in good will hunting is awful here he seems to lack both intelligence and guts that's enough on this one
<START> national lampoon's class reunion was a flop when it was released it didn't stay long in theaters in my big city why because it's bad br br not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way the entire cast of actors were mostly unknowns then and have remained unknowns after this turkey br br the idea is actually great a parody of slasher flicks but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect br br just avoid this comedy your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing misfire
<START> about the baby why wasn't big brother assuming he'd be hungry for a bottle or some nourishment or a diaper change he should have been screaming non stop after that many hours without care definitely stupid to take the baby from a safe place when he didn't need to br br and why was the road miraculously clear whenever anyone wanted to drive somewhere didn't any uprooted trees fall on the roads and block them br br i can't imagine the cops at the roadblock not immediately following after any young person who would crash it especially when they said it was dangerous to go there br br that being said it was nice to have a movie children could safely watch for a change
<START> every so often a movie comes along that knocks me down a notch and reminds me that my taste in films i seek out to watch isn't always impeccable i normally would stay away from stuff like this but i was duped by some glowing reviews and the rohmer pedigree br br there's an initial and intriguing novelty to the production where rohmer essentially superimposes the actors onto painted digital back drops of revolution era france this quickly wanes and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint by numbers scene what we're left with is a boring and stuffy film about aristocrats in 18th century france none of the characters are appealing or sympathetic the pace is so languid the dialogue so arduous and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to rohmer that i ended up not caring whose head rolled who was harboring who or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about the movie would've greatly benefited from some semblance of emotional build up and a music score there's some fine classical music used at the very end despite being so talky the film plays much like a silent film and the worst kind of film at that a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects only the most astute french historians will find anything to take from this film as it dose seem to paint well known events from a new angle the lady is english and a royalist otherwise avoid this yawner at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia i dozed off twice
<START> my wife did not realize what a gem this movie was when she picked it up it is a story that shows real world success through hard work and determination br br that is so refreshing in a world of violent movies not that i dis like them but you have to love a movie that succeeds without it
<START> i like ghost stories good ghost stories of bumps in the night voices that cannot be explained now i've see many of them as special efx have a ever more grip on todays films some times to find a real gem you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories now this one very rare pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called the new house was one of the most scariest films i ever saw it was on once in 1972 i was only 9 but nothing since then even compared to it with all the remake going on in hollywood some one should do this one as is with no more special efx than the original this episode was down right creepy as hell i'm lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find the only other 2 ghost stories to even come close was the original the haunting and george c scott in the changling wish someone would do more ghost stories like these
<START> well this movie is amazingly awful i felt sorry for the actors involved in this project because i'm sure they did not write their lines which were sometimes delivered with slight sarcasm which lead me to believe they were not taking this movie seriously nor could anybody who watches this obnoxious off beat monster slasher while watching this creature unknown i could not help but think that there was not much of a budget or a competent writer on the crew but if you go into watching this for a laugh you'll be happy the movie is shameless to mocking itself because i cant see how anybody could look at this and be proud of pumping this straight to dvd clichÃ©d wanna be action thriller horror movie fightfest to light
<START> nicolas roeg's projects are variable to say the least but are never less than interesting insignificance is obviously first and foremost an adapted stageplay it's wordy and pretty much 'room bound' but it pays to view this film more than once the underlying themes are not overtly presented and what's more it takes a while to adjust to the juxtaposition and role reversals of the four protagonists einstein mccarthy munroe and dimaggio br br einstein is wracked by guilt over hiroshima yet fancies the simplicity of a sexual liaison with munro munro is sick of being seen as a bimbo and craves intellectual credence senator mccarthy is at the height of his witch hunting powers but is an impotent sleazebag dimaggio is insecure about his celebrity self obsessed and prone to violence each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction each character has a troubled abused abusive past and a questionable future gradually we see that obsession itself is the central theme america's obsession with its postwar cultural icons and mores the obsessions of the protagonists for something none can have peace of mind and or happiness br br compared with the theory of relativity a proposed unified field theory and indeed the cosmos itself all the aspirations and interactions of roeg's protagonists seem insignificant yet these aspects of the physical universe it's all quantum trust me affect us when they are applied to the development of the means to destroy us monroe's mention of the principle behind the neutron bomb without naming it as such is not an anachronism per se but can only be understood by a contemporary audience indeed all the references within the script are only accessible to a knowledgeable viewer one au fait with '50s occurrences personality cults and how they affect us in the 21st century br br this film and its screenplay are either very very clever or extremely opaque and pretentious ultimately however probably insignificant br br live long and prosper br br
<START> i really can't believe this movie is not in the imdb worst 250 it is absolutely terrible when i originally saw it i remember talking about it in a college class and two other people had also seen it we were all telling other class members not to see it because it was so horrible by the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was don't be like them just pass this by i'm sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie
<START> when i borrowed this movie from a friend thankfully i did not buy it on the package which truly looked bad and ugly was printed the ultimate vampire horror after watching it i thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the film itself the story begins when a teenager surprise is chased by some vampire zombie creatures br br lighting sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holiday video on a ten year old vhs system if not worse i gave the movie a 2 out of 10 and only because the promo t shirts looked kind of cool i don't want to dis' film students or splatter movies generally but i've seen braindead and i've seen a 20 dollar budget movie from students that was ten times better than this crap
<START> this was a painful example of a cheap boring and unoriginal show produced by australian tv stations to fulfil local content quotas the writing was truly terrible and i'm not surprised that the writers are those responsible for the worst australian film in recent memory the honerable wally norman br br nothing about this tv series was funny ever not even mildly amusing it was just tired and bad and worst of all it really thought it was funny it was simply embarrassing to watch br br there is something very suss about this show being given 10 out of 10 on imdb try to find a real review by a real australian viewer of the show there weren't many and it is impossible or crazy there are loafs of bread that are funnier than this show br br avoid the show at all cost and if it does come out on dvd remember that the laughter that deserves was unintentional
<START> some of my old friends suggested me to watch this movie but i got chance only recently i had high hopes of seeing something interesting from kamal hans what i saw was bunch of garbage camera angles mixed at high speed i could not understand what was the message except demeaning hinduism i am more like many religion type but i felt kamal hasan is a man low character to have orchestrated this kind of thought he could have made a horror movie than this crap he tried to add hollywood genre of viruses and god forbid he did not convert that guy into a mutant and ultimately going to go for world domination this is a much befitting movie for a film school vs regular public shame on him for not holding up to the talent he has starting of story tried chaos to borrow ideas from butterfly effect then in between little religious harmony at the cost of insulting hinduism once again i insult hinduism more but this movie has no equal and my insult is same for religion in general which may have made this movie intellectual one
<START> just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion every line every phrase every picture is exactly in place and lindsay crouse and joe mantegna are just the cool shrink and the sleazy con man so well cast 10 out of 10
<START> after looking at monkeys oops apes for more than one hour i was feeling like one too i was an ape spending money on this movie please people hold you money in your pocket and go see some funny movie like bridget jones's diary
<START> dreary schlocky just plain dreadful and awful let's be honest when you sit down to watch something called the double d avenger you aren't expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment you are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts you don't get really either of these in the video the story as it consistent with most of these types is inane kitten natividad runs a local pub finds out she has breast cancer flies down to south america for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a super human abilities giver returns and fights dressed as the double d avenger a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition as stories go i have seen a lot worse but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous the action sequences lack zip drive motivation and are tissue thin the acting isn't even properly campy and the dialog is the pits nothing and i mean nothing is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy handed boob references all could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it but they all fall way short kitten haji and raven de la croix are all quite older still lovely in their own ways yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be older campy caricatures of their former selves instead they look so lame and desperate more because of the vehicle they are starring in rather than their own abilities there are some other lovely ladies but you really do not see much of anything pg 13 definitely could be an appropriate rating for this the material the actresses and director are all tired tiresome and dated and again not funny it was a brutal hour plus sitting through this and that is a shame as i was expecting something campy and fun the guy playing bubba by the way was the only real laugh for me not that he was good at all mind you but every time he opened his mouth i kept thinking how truly awful he was the lone bright spot here at all is seeing mr sci fi himself forrest j ackerman play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax frankenstein affectionately called frankie other than that this is a complete bust now how is that for another tired dreadful trite pun
<START> i was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror the basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasn't able to excite really scare or shock me there was one part in the entire film that i thought was gruesome but even that didn't redeem it i did get to like the character of kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this film and i think the director writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on kate's part it may have worked jeremy's acting was wooden to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry or lack of it such a shame disappointing
<START> this film has so little class in comparison to strangers on a train or even accidental meeting for that matter that despite plot similarities i wouldn't feel right in actually comparing this to either of them the yancy butler character came across as such a dopey dimwit i was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue watching br br i don't enjoy many lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home i often groan silently but this film caused me to protest out loud stand up leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself before i returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torture br br dean morgan rochester ny
<START> in an era of such awful cartoons i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated movies br br this movie does contradict the first i won't deny that however when i was in the target age group for this movie i didn't even notice nor would it have mattered if i did the people who made it may have used new generation to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly began br br this was my favorite movie at age 3 6 and it did not scare me or confuse me at all br br
<START> la bÃªte by walerian borowczyk is based on the short story lokis written by prosper merimÃ©e lucy broadhurst lisabeth hummel an american heiress betrothed to the son of an impoverished marquis arrives at the family's crumbling chÃ¢teau and learns of a mythical ursine beast purported to prowl the nearby forest it is fabled that a former lady of the house sirpa lane once engaged in perverse sex with the creature and lucy finds herself consumed by dreams of the incident the beast is an art house mix of surreal horror explicit sleaze and porno there's implied bestiality assault and perversion in the priesthood copious fake ejaculate smeared on bared breasts masturbation with a rose and most graphic of all the eponymous beast toying with incredibly big phallus still this genuinely erotic film is wonderfully photographed and tasteless the women here are stunningly beautiful and they are naked most of the time overall la bÃªte is a visual feast whether it be from the fetishistic attention to detail or the visual motifs pregnant with information borowczyk's masterpiece should be watched with care and attention a must see for fans of european cult cinema
