<START> i loved so much about this movie the time taken to develop the characters the attention to detail the superb performances the stunning lighting and cinematography the wonderful soundtrack br br it has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast paced action flick if we lived in elizabethan days i'd say this movie's a bit like a shakespearean tragedy but since we don't let's say it's more like a drama suspense movie br br the plot is simple but the story is complex the movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored much of the story is shown rather than told which i find makes it more subtle and moving and which also works well for a story based on a comic book or graphic novel at times i felt i was actually there in the 1930s part of this story there was such a realistic yet dream like quality in the style of its telling br br i don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon but in this case i do though i did enjoy the book too i've bought the dvd which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary br br i also took my little cousin who's a little younger than the boy in the movie to see it after i saw it for the first time because he has issues at home and i wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father son issues with him he loved it and the discussion
<START> i have seen this film three times now and each time i see it it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch br br the acting is amazing which is not hard to believe since it is daniel day lewis who is an amazing actor brenda fricker is the surprise wonder in it though she captures your heart as the mother of a physically disabled boy who is not able to walk or speak until he is in his late teens br br i can't say enough good things about the movie but i will stop here i recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies that are based on actual events or just enjoy good dramas in general
<START> i saw this series when it world premiered at the toronto film festival i liked the idea behind the film where two men got together and told a director from each country to direct a movie about 911 these directors never met before until the project was complete and they saw how it looked all together warning spoilers ahead all the pieces were very powerful and some were controversial if you are an american then you may not like this as some of the pieces may be found anti american however i know a few americans who enjoyed these series the piece that i found the best was the one from india it was about how a muslim family living in the states had 2 sons and one of them was missing the americans gave them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed that he was linked with the terrorist bombing it captures the mom's despair and humiliation of these accusations so well that it brought tears to my eyes in the end we see that her son had died while trying to save the many victims from the crash of the towers this was a true story and that was what made it so real there were a lot of emotional and powerful pieces and the african piece was one of the best it was humourous yet just as powerful as the others a must see for everyone and hopefully america will unban this and let it play in their country
<START> when i was kid back in the 1970s a local theatre had children's matinees every saturday and sunday afternoon anybody remember those they showed this thing one year around christmas time me and some friends went to see it i expected a cool santa claus movie what i got was a terribly dubbed you can tell and truly creepy movie br br something about santa claus and merlin the magician don't ask me what those two are doing in the same movie fighting satan some joker in a silly devil costume complete with horns the images had me cringing in my seat i always found santa spooky to begin with so that didn't help the guy in the satan suit didn't help but what really horrified me were the wooden rein deers that pulled santa's sled when he wound them up and the creepy sound they made and the movements i remember having nightmares about those things all these years later i still remember walking out of that theatre more than a little disturbed by what i saw my friends were sort of frightened by it too i just saw an ad for it on tv and all those nightmares came roaring back this is a creepy disturbing little christmas film that will probably scare the pants off any little kid who sees it avoid this one unless you really want to punish your kids this gets a 1
<START> this movie has a slew of great adult stars but fails to get you interested in a way an adult film should among all the stars you couldn't get your kicks from any of the scenes the movie is shot in a dream like middle age set which is embarrassingly cheesy the acting is worse than keanu reeves the sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor talk about their kid in college and the dialogue is the worse i have seen in a movie the plot also was worse by ten fold i'd stick to the amateur route the audio commentary was useless since it's a skin flick but even then that was bad too unless your a diehard jenna jameson fan there is little here 4 10
<START> the notorious bettie page is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of america bettie page played by gretchen mol was one of the first sex icons in america the type of modeling bettie page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a u s senate investigation in the 1950s br br walking out of the film all i could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s you can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot that the footage questioned in the notorious bettie page seems almost childlike and innocent most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when bettie page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals i find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because looking at this movie in terms of today's pornography it was very tastefully done br br to be honest i was pretty impressed with the notorious bettie page i found the film to be very well done and interesting the movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in america gretchen mol looks just like bettie page and gives a very fine performance i also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950s br br my only complaint about the film was the running time there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been i looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the toronto film festival also the ending was pretty tame and i was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about bettie page's life where the film left off those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid the acting was great especially gretchen and the writing was good br br mary harron who directed american psycho which is one of my favorite films is the director and writer of the notorious bettie page i feel that mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like psycho bettie page is a character study and a fine one at that harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease as well as all the characters she is a very talented director who i hope will be around for many years to come br br bottom line the notorious bettie page is definitely worth a look it's a very interesting story that shows how far america as well as the world has come in terms of pornography the film also provides a fine performance by gretchen mol who literally nails the role of bettie page on the head and top it off with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands sadly this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but i think it's worth checking out br br moviemanmenzel's final rating for the notorious bettie page is a 8 10 it's an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in american history
<START> i can't believe that steven segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong br br the plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book br br steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation he shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all br br i hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic the condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner br br my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds i read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget segal being paid 5 of that and that the movie still came in under budget i must concur br br it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie
<START> high heels are tricksy things they can elevate women or cross dressing men to newfound heights put forward a sharp statement of style and bring a touch of fragile elegance alternatively they can be a perilous foot pain that will inevitably lead to trips falls and ultimate tragedy tacones lejanos is more of a disappointment trip than a stylish high riser br br almodÃ³var's mother daughter drama is stylish for sure but in terms of plot it's a tongue tied and tedious affair full of confusing complex characters that never fully engage or make sense a few moments of comedy aside tacones lejanos just isn't interesting the best bit comes at the beginning in a marvellously macabre case of manslaughter orchestrated by a child from this brilliant bit of black comedy things are looking up but then the film comes to a heel br br there's solid enough acting performances and there's some stylish arty direction that you'd expect from almodÃ³var but otherwise tacones lejanos isn't an impressive piece of spanish cinema with a story of murder showbiz femininity fractured mother daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge a transvestite and a police informer this could have been a melodramatic powerhouse instead it's poor high heels stumbles for sure
<START> this movie has it all action fighting dancing bull riding music pretty girls this movie is an authenic look at middle america believe me i was there in 1980 lots of oil money lots of women and lots of honky tonks too bad they are all gone now the movie is essentially just another boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl back but it is redeemed by the actors and the music there is absolutely no movie with any better music that this movie and that includes american graffiti it is a movie i watch over and over again and never get tired of it every time i watch it i am young again and it is time to go out honky tonking the only reason i only gave it a 9 is because you cannot rate a movie zero i do not feel you should rate one 10
<START> as a convert into the church of jesus christ of latter day saints i try to absorb as much as i can of my new religion's history i was invited to attend a showing of this film with my sons the other young men women as well as their families of our ward br br on a beautiful spring evening we drove to kirtland ohio to the church's historical village located there we were to have had reservations at the vistor's center to view this movie since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries i was intrigued the only full length motion pictures of the church's i had seen was legacy and my best two years both which i thought were very well written and preformed br br at the beginning the missionary interpretor passed out tissues stating that several people had been deeply moved to the point of tears by this movie i thought ok but it takes a lot to move me to tears imagine my surprise when i found myself sobbing it truly is a very moving inspirational testament to the prophet joseph smith br br see it believe in it's powerful message
<START> scoop is also the name of a late thirties evelyn waugh novel and woody allen's new movie though set today has a nostalgic charm and simplicity it hasn't the depth of characterization intense performances suspense or shocking final frisson of allen's penultimate effort match point argued by many including this reviewer to be a strong return to form but scoop does closely resemble allen's last outing in its focus on english aristocrats posh london flats murder and detection this time woody leaves behind the arriviste murder mystery genre and returns to comedy and is himself back on the screen as an amiable vaudevillian a magician called sid waterman stage moniker the great splendini who counters some snobs' probing with i used to be of the hebrew persuasion but as i got older i converted to narcissism following a revelation in the midst of splendini's standard dematerializing act with scarlett johansson as sondra pransky the audience volunteer the mismatched pair get drawn into a dead ace english journalist's post mortem attempt to score one last top news story on the edge of the styx joe strombel ian mcshane has just met the shade of one lord lyman's son's secretary who says she was poisoned and she's told him the charming aristocratic bounder son peter lyman hugh jackman was the tarot card murderer a london serial killer sondra and sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths with sid's deadpan wit and sondra's bumptious beauty they cut a quick swath through to the cream of the london aristocracy br br woody isn't pawing his young heroine muse as in match point johansson again as in the past this time moreover scarlett's not an ambitious sexpot and would be movie star she's morphed surprisingly into a klutzy bespectacled but still pretty coed sid and sondra have no flirtation which is a great relief they simply team up more or less politely to carry out strombel's wishes by befriending lyman and watching him for clues to his guilt with only minimal protests sid consents to appear as sondra's dad sondra who's captivated peter by pretending to drown in his club pool re christens herself jade spence mr spence i e woody keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks but he amuses dowagers with these and beats their husbands at poker spewing non stop one liners and all the while maintaining apparently with success that he's in oil and precious metals just as jade has told him to say br br that's about all there is to it or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome at first allen's decision to make johansson a gauche naively plainspoken and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an all around bad decision but johansson who has pluck and panache as an actress miraculously manages to carry it off helped by jackman an actor who knows how to make any actress appear desirable if he desires her the film actually creates a sense of relationships to make up for it limited range of characters sid and sondra spar in a friendly way and peter and sondra have a believable attraction even though it's artificial and tainted she is after all going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniac br br what palls a bit is allen's again drooling over english wealth and class things his brooklyn background seems to have left him despite all his celebrity with a irresistible hankering for jackman is an impressive fellow glamorous and dashing his parents were english but could this athletic musical comedy star raised in australia x man's wolverine really pass as an aristocrat only in the movies perhaps here and in kate and leopold br br this isn't as strong a film as match point but to say it's a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong it has no more depth than a half hour radio drama or a tv show but woody's jokes are far funnier and more original than you'll get in any such media affair and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness it doesn't matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when it's diverting summer entertainment on a hot day you don't want a heavy meal the whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment without crude jokes or bombastic effects without vince vaughan or owen wilson critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the allen decline that preceded match point don't believe them he doesn't try too hard why should he he may be 70 but verbally he's still light on his feet and his body moves pretty fast too
<START> well let me say that i have always been a steven seagal fan and his movies are usually great but this just don't measure up to the rest this in my opinion is very stupid i did not like it all the biggest reason i don't like it is because it is very flawed and to me does not make much sense the acting is very bad even steven seagal does not do good acting the rest of the actors i can see because they just do direct to video movies it does not follow a straight storyline everything happens at once so that why it doesn't make much sense ther is barely any action in it at all and in order to make an action movie good you usually need action in it the special effects are very bad and you can tell are fake so all in all this has to seagals worst movie of all so if you want to see a steven seagal movie don't rent this one just pretend it does not exist so just avoid this movie br br overall score out of br br out of
<START> this movie is just lame a total waste of time and money the jokes are predictable the characters are so clichÃ© and the way it talks about rpg gamers is not funny as well the problem is that the writers seems not to know how a rpg game works and most important how to make jokes about this game of course there are a bunch of losers who play rpg like freaking retards and total losers but for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game the story doesn't make any sense at all who cares about how long a game is being played the greatest problem in this movie is that the writers and actors didn't even try to know what rpg is about to make jokes about it i felt ashamed by watching this lame movie
<START> too many sources routinely lump this thought provoking period drama in part based on historical fact together with the superficially similar nunsploitation which was a mainstay in '70s euro trash cinema overlooking the righteous anger that drives the whole endeavor perhaps coincidentally it was also director gianfranco mingozzi's singular attempt at narrative film making outside of many well received documentaries br br safely set within a historical context flavia charts the growing rebellion of an early 15th century italian nun florinda bolkan's career performance even surpassing her sterling work in lucio fulci's devastating don't torture a duckling locked away in convent by her not so nobleman father in a desperate attempt to curb the girl's budding sensuous nature wondering why women are relegated to secondary roles at best in life as in holy scripture she is confronted by ways in which male domination can rupture female lives inspiring revolt fueled by the ranting of semi crazed older sister agatha indelibly portrayed by veteran actress maria casarÃ¨s from marcel carnÃ©'s les enfants du paradis and more constructively by a muslim invasion joining the oppressors and perhaps unwittingly manipulating them to do her bidding flavia truly becomes the outcast she already felt herself to be with expected tragic results br br with its breathtaking widescreen compositions by alfio contini who shot michelangelo antonioni's zabriskie point this is an uncompromising and austere account of one woman's fierce yet ultimately futile fight against patriarchal society which allotted her no rights beyond childbearing or whoring as sister agatha wryly remarks a lengthy drug induced fantasy sequence clearly modeled on ken russell's otherwise far more flamboyant devils notwithstanding the movie turns out relatively stingy in the skin department making something of a mockery out of its semi porn reputation this is a serious work deserving rediscovery and restoration of its unjustly tarnished reputation
<START> honestly i went to see the movie not because of the actors not because of the plot but because it was rated 17 here in luxembourg and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category believe me being a movie freak i have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime ichi the killer irreversible hellraiser but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture i have ever seen br br the plot is plain stupid the directing is awful acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of so called horror soundtracks there isn't a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie and some of the scenes are really hard to stand especially the scene where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby cries horrible i can't understand why the movie was rated 16 in germany where normally the criteria are real tough e g kill bill brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing even a movie like state of grace is rated 18 no one can call this a horror movie because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public showing the creep's face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision for me excuse my expression it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies in some scenes you see violence that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything the plot has holes and flaws the dialog is boring honestly i can't mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the british and scottish accent br br if i had something to say i would ban this movie from the theaters i fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap br br i'm looking forward to getting feedbacks to my thread and i'd be happy to discuss about one or the other topic br br livin' the dream baby livin' the dream david aames
<START> i settled back to watch read my lips a plate of freedom fries before me the food was quickly forgotten as i became engrossed by director and co writer jacques audiard's original and superb thriller br br carla emmanuelle devos is a secretary at a firm that develops major building projects she actually has some significant responsibilities that don't often fall to secretaries and she's capable and ambitious and thwarted by a male hierarchy that will exploit but not reward her br br work piling up faster than she can handle it carla is told to hire a secretary enter ex con and general layabout paul vincent cassel he lies about his skills and in fact has none that any legitimate enterprise might require after an initial serious misunderstanding by paul as to carla's interest in him the two become allies a quirky friendship starts in a stunt that would have made a real carla a major contender on the apprentice she trumps her egotistic male adversary at work with paul's connivance exit the rival br br carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid with it she hears almost normally she turns the hearing aid off to isolate herself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people she's also very lonely a heroic makeup effort was made to have her appear plain but she's truly beautiful she hasn't a boyfriend she babysits so a friend can have a liaison it is a french movie worse and humiliatingly she accedes to a girlfriend's plea that she hang out somewhere while that married friend has it off with her paramour in carla's bed not nice br br as carla and paul get to know each other better the barely repressed larcenous side of the not so former felon emerges there's a side story by the way of paul's relationship with his parole officer which neatly complements the main plot and has its own big surprise ending br br read my lips ingenious paul recognizes that carla's ability to read lips even from a considerable distance is more than the amusing parlor trick it first seems to be br br from there a caper develops enough said br br paul and carla are a true criminal oddball couple she wants love but will also accept money he wants her sort of but business must come before possible erotic satiation together cassel and devos are strong actors carrying an unusual crime tale to its end very convincingly br br rent it or buy it but if you enjoy a good crime story you'll go for read my lips and you may well want to watch it several times i do br br 9 10
<START> i read that jessie matthews was approached and turned down co starring with fred astaire in damsel in distress jessie matthews in her prime never left her side of the pond to do any american musical films if they had teamed for this film it would have been a once in a lifetime event br br it's a pity because damsel in distress has everything else going for it fred astaire story and adapted to screen by author p g wodehouse burns allen for comedy and songs by the gershwin brothers in answer to the question posed by the nice work if you can get it there isn't much you could ask more for this film br br except a leading lady though ginger rogers made several films away from fred astaire damsel in distress is the only film astaire made without rogers while they were a team young joan fontaine was cast in this opposite astaire br br her character has none of the bite that ginger rogers's parts do in these films all she basically has to do is act sweet and demure she also doesn't contribute anything musically and if i had to rate all the dancing partners of fred astaire joan fontaine would come out at the bottom the poor woman is just horrible in the things are looking up number br br when she co starred later on in a musical with bing crosby the emperor waltz it's no accident that fontaine is given nothing musical to do br br the version i have is a colorized one and in this case i think it actually did some good the idyllic lush green english countryside of p g wodehouse is really brought out in this vhs copy especially in that number i mentioned before with astaire and fontaine which does take place in the garden br br burns allen on the other hand as a couple of old vaudeville troopers complement astaire in grand style in the stiff upper lip number the surreal fun house sequence is marvelously staged br br p g wodehouse's aristocracy runs the gamut with constance collier at her haughty best and for once montagu love as fontaine's father as a nice man on film br br the biggest hit out of a damsel in distress is a foggy day maybe the best known song about the british capital city since london bridge is falling down done in the best simple elegant manner by fred astaire it's one of those songs that will endure as long as london endures and even after br br overlooking the young and inexperienced joan fontaine a damsel in distress rates as a classic classic score classic dancing classic comedy who could ask for anything more
<START> first a technical review the script is so slow it is really a 25 minute story blown up to 1 hour 40 min the dialogue is so flat and truly one dimensional the acting is pathetic they seem to really have lifted schoolchildren out of class to read a few lines from an idiot board as for the whole point of the story namely war is bad oh there's a shock is really non existent without out the lets shock 'em and get great publicity scene nobody would be talking about this film it is so bad it actually bothers me to think what better things the money used this could have gone on believe me i've seen some bad emperor's new clothes films but the one thing i can say for them is at least they were well shot and well made while the camera wobbled during two scenes in this read all the other reviews avoid at all costs and don't talk about it
<START> i loved the first azumi movie i've seen ms ueto in a variety of her tv appearances and i've seen my fair share of samurai and ninja flicks i have to say that this movie was much weaker than i'd expected br br given the movie's cast and set up in azumi they should have been able to do a much better job with this movie but instead it was slow plodding in parts and sprinkled with very poor unconvincing and wooden acting br br when they bothered to reference the first movie they did so in a manner that was pretty loose and weak in azumi the title character is the best of a group of superior killers in azumi 2 she seems somehow diminished and less impressive br br that's not to say it was a total loss there were a few decent fight scenes and some over the top characters unfortunately the movie suffers overall from the simple fact that shusuke kaneko and yoshiaki kawajiri are not ryuhei kitamura and isao kiriyama the latter two truly captured the manga feel in their screenplay whereas the former never quite got it
<START> well i'll start by admitting i'm not a john ford fan i watched the informer only because i'm trying to work my way through a list of the greats so if you are just move along 'cause you're not going to agree with me br br what an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is i will say that there is a good idea for a movie here it made me think about how few films there are about the irish revolution but as usual ford is determined to bury it under over acting and cheap sentiment i suppose it's somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less than seamless transition that was being made from the silents to the talkies the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue of course title cards would prevent ford from restating every bit of emotion six times what dialogue there is usually has a they're always after me lucky charms quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an irish accent of course as bad as they are the accents are helpful in reminding us we're in ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some german expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over it feels as if with an eagle eye you might see some villagers off to torch dr frankenstein in the background br br techniques change tastes change so i won't go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day but it's not one of the classics that hold up more just fair warning about the kind of over simplified malarkey to which ford was going to devote his career
