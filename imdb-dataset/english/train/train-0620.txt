<START> if you have never viewed this film and like old time veteran actors this is the film for you seeing frank sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken in cheeks and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs michele morgan millie pico gave an outstanding performance with plenty of dance and musical numbers leon errol cyrus drake gave a great supporting role along with victor borge sir victor fitzroy victor who performed classical piano and no slap stick comedy like he did in his career this is not a great musical but frank sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940's
<START> no matter what anyone tells you there is a mere fact to the word possession in film circles such as what possessed you to greenlight this film religion doesn't have anything to do with it but common sense does that is if your head is clear and you are of sound mind to make a judgment br br on many levels i tried to rationalize where this film would entertain or even interest the average consumer the star the story the unique idea a buddy movie that kids would love with a dinosaur and a black woman on my goodness i am sure when this was an idea it sounded good but somewhere during the course of development someone should have pointed out where the idea could not translate into a piece of entertainment anyone would wish to watch or pay for unless they were very much deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something the rest of us could not see br br regardless this is a complete mess mess mess sin and a mess br br who cares about the plot what plot et al whoopie got a paycheck but i would have been embarrassed to take it i sure hope she fired her agent manager publicist over this career move obviously not she went on to make more bad films and more bad films sad
<START> phantasm of 1979 was a highly atmospheric creepy scary and very original horror flick and in one word cult the first sequel of 1988 was gory witty action packed and highly entertaining after the first sequel however phantasm creator don coscarelly apparently lacked new ideas phantasm iii lord of the dead of 1994 is certainly not a complete failure it even is quite entertaining but there is no more originality and the desperate attempts to bring in something new are at times tiresome which makes it quite disappointing in comparison to its predecessors br br spoilers br br quite in the beginning we are introduced the secret behind the mysterious sentinel spheres the brain sucking flying silver balls is unraveled thenceforward a number of unnecessary and annoying new characters such as tim a home alone style little kid who happens to be great at shooting an rocky a tough and super cool nunchaku swinging black chick with a crew cut are introduced the film also has its qualities reggie bannister is again very cool as the pony tailed guitar playing reggie angus scrimm is still quite creepy as the tall man but the fact that the tall man talks a lot more in this film makes him loose some of his creepiness the character of mike is played by a michael baldwin again he had been replaced by james legros in part 2 which in my opinion doesn't make much of a difference the gore also keeps the film interesting enough to watch but it is still a disappointment especially because the attempts to make up for the lack of ideas get annoying quite quickly br br all things considered phantasm iii is an acceptable time waster but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors fans of the first two phantasm films can give it a try but i recommend not to set your expectations too high
<START> superhero movies pretty much always suck and this is no exception its only redeeming quality is the fact the movie could have been even worse i would put 'batman robin' and 'steel' above this movie so yes it is that bad br br if your looking for a black superhero check out 'blankman' its not a serious superhero movie but at least its entertaining
<START> this is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made even for fellini about the only one more bizarre is his satyricon this is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence opulence and sexual challenge sutherland makes a curiously unappealing casanova and the odd goings on in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover's autobiography fail to engage the viewer the art direction and costume design are however outstanding the academy missed on not even nominating the former but did itself justice by rewarding an oscar for the latter also nominated oddly was the disjointed pointless and almost inacessible screenplay go figure the film on video is only 150 minutes 16 minutes short of the original running time this viewer was grateful
<START> this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing it is shot on video not film i have not seen the likes of this since the early 70's when late night networks showed movie of the week 'horror flicks' shot in video it looks like a bad soap opera and that is paying it a compliment some of the actors give it their best shot michael des barres does okay with what he is given to do which is to act like a sex addict out of control i can't say that it is pleasant to watch br br nastassja kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film with very little variation in camera angles i can't fault her for someone else's poor blocking but she is totally unbelievable in her role her little girl voice works against her here and i consider myself a nastassja kinski fan she is certainly ageless and exotic but she's outside her range with this br br alexandra paul is pathetically overwrought every line she delivers is with three exclamation points someone must have directed her to scream at all costs why would michael des barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew br br finally rosanna arquette as the sweet maligned wife comes off okay and probably the most believable of the bunch but that is not saying much br br this has to be the worst film i have seen in years
<START> this was a blind buy used dvd it totally killed a nice buzz i had going when i hit play br br it's bubble headed comedy but it's um squalid the plot is zany but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived i ultimately found it depressing to watch br br maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven goofy caper film i know i know the quotes on the box the academy award nomination mean nothing
<START> new york playwright michael caine as sidney bruhl is 46 years old and fading fast as the film opens mr caine's latest play flops on broadway tv reviewers poke fun at caine and he gets drunk passing out on the long island railroad lands caine in montauk instead of his residence in east hampton finally arriving home caine is comforted by tightly attired wife dyan cannon as myra an unfortunately high strung heart patient there caine and ms cannon discuss a new play called deathtrap written by hunky young christopher reeve as clifford cliff anderson one of caine's former students the couple believe mr reeve's deathtrap is the hit needed to revive caine's career br br the trap is setÂ for a wickedly funny who'll do it br br directed by sidney lumet ira levin's long running broadway hit doesn't stray too far from its stage origin the cast is enjoyable and the story's twists are still engrossing one thing that did not work for me was the curtain call ending surely it played better on stage deathtrap is a fun film to watch again the performances are dead on but in hindsight the greeting reeve gives caine at the east hampton train station should have been simplified to a smiling hello the location isn't really east hampton but the windmill and pond look similar and the much ballyhooed love scene is shockingly tepid but the play was so good even a gifted director couldn't ruin it and mr lumet doesn't disappoint br br deathtrap 3 19 82 sidney lumet michael caine christopher reeve dyan cannon irene worth
<START> this is another one of those movies that could have been great the basic premise is good immortal cat people who kill to live etc sort of a variation on the vampire concept br br the thing that makes it all fall apart is the total recklessness of the main characters even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive look how long it took to catch the unibomber and that was because a family member figured it out br br by contrast the kid and to a lesser extent the mom behave as though they're untouchable the kid kills without a thought for not leaving evidence or a trail or a living witness how these people managed to stay alive and undiscovered for a month is unbelievable let alone decades or centuries br br it's really a shame this could have been so much more if it had been written plausibly i e giving the main characters the level of common sense they would have needed to get by for so long br br other than that not a bad showing i loved the bit at the end where every cat in town converges on the house every time i put out food on the porch and see our cats suddenly rush in from wherever they were before i think of that scene
<START> outside the household is a different world and the family struggle to tread the line between dads authority and their hopes and dreams br br the period is captured the bakelite light swithes the georgian floorpan the picture rails the wall paper the short skirts the cheeky lads the mini van shiny modern mangles br br the location is captured a wind lashed glacier hewn rocky landscape walls of local stone community freedom br br but there is much much more childhood happiness sensuality pride values freedom authority rebellion violence in the deepest sense love struggle puberty naivety morality trust faith deceit machismo manners maturity loss poverty sacrifice horror acceptence revelation comedy and parenthood are all there and in no particular order br br this film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are as relevent today as ever the fact that some of these aren't tackled directly is testament in itself to the attitudes of the day but the fact that they are all here is a testament to the acting skill the story and the direction br br if there's anything bad about this film it's that all this deeply entrenched and wonderfully enacted tension is swept away a little too lightly towards the end maybe i missunderstand the doom and gloom felt by many teenagers really does disappear if they deal with it maybe the film is trying to send even that message too well worth doing br br what is the film trying to say kids parents were young too parents struggle too everyone makes mistakes everyone learns things change struggle can end happily parents don't try too hard try to remember that your support is the key to their well being br br it sounds simplistic doesn't it sometimes the film feels like that too but it's then that you notice how much is being being challenged and uncovered br br the film is a classic br br not the problems themsleves
<START> there's nothing really to dislike about the odd couple and it's no surprise that jack lemmon and walter matthau make a hugely winning comedic team but there's something so underdeveloped about neil simon's adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a full bodied film i have not seen the play but have to assume that the screen version is fairly faithful since simon wrote it so the defects cannot be blamed on a stage to screen adaptation there are some interesting ideas in this story two recently divorced men who fall immediately into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither knows any differently that simon never fully fleshes out still there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours
<START> this is a great film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of today's politically minded filmmakers a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days while the bouyant optimism of the 1960's can't be regained i think we can at least learn a lesson from the film's breezy energy and charm i don't know what those who label the film boring were watching there's so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that 15 min at a time
<START> this is yet another depressing and boring film about aids and tragedy it begins very uneventful and predictable and continues throughout the movie i kept waiting for it to pick up but unfortunately it never did the acting is fair but the script needs a lot of work and if you're looking for the nudity don't waste your time with these not so hot actors due to the poor sound quality and lack of captions i missed 1 8 of the movie if you have never seen over five gay films or have recently come to terms with being gay you may find this film interesting otherwise it's your run of the mill low budget movie it ranks as one of the worst gay films i have ever seen
<START> this movie is very very very poor i have seen better movies br br there was a bit of tension but not much to make you jump out of your chair it begins slowly with the building of tension which is not a success at least if you ask me though at some points or moments i must say it was a bit funny when people got shot and how they went down br br they should had made it something like scary movie then it might be a better movie because i watched only pieces of the movie by skipping scenes and it got to boring through out the movie i must say that i felt sleepy watching this movie so i sure can say it is not worth it br br don't waste time on even thinking to do something with this movie besides leaving it where it already is somewhere very dusty
<START> this movie is one among the very few indian movies that would never fade away with the passage of time nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish even as the indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the p t styled film songs br br the cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of josef werching that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entirety br br gone are the days of great cinema when every scene had to be clipped many times and retakes taken before finalizing it while meticulous attention was paid in crafting and editing the scenes some of its poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity like the instance when meena kumari refuses to say yes as an approval for nikah marriage bond and climbs down the hill while running berserk in traumatized frenzy at the moment raj kumar follows her and a strong gale of wind blew away the veil of kumari and onto the legs of kumar br br kamal amrohi shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of indian cinema's history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting 12 years he had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without meena's close ups because meena kumari the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early 1971
<START> pet sematary is an adaptation from the stephen king novel of the same title the story follows the creeds an all american middle class family who move into a house out in the country the family consists of louis and rachel and their two young children ellie and their toddler son gage the house couldn't be better and the family meets a strange but friendly old man jud who lives across the road he leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies filled with a huge amount of animal graves and just beyond there lies a sacred indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power when the family cat church is killed louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery and strangely enough soon after church returns to life but there's something evil about him now he isn't the same cat he used to be and when a tragic accident takes the life of young gage louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son unfortunately he gets more than he bargained for br br having read stephen king's novel i can say that the book is much better than the film not to say the movie is bad because it isn't the book is just a little bit better the real strength in this film lies in it's story which is both bizarre but extremely original something that king's stories are typically known for the script is very well adapted from the story and while it minorly differs in some aspects it's a pretty good page to screen transformation there are a few plot holes here and there nothing major though besides that this movie is actually pretty scary and it succeeds in it's intention to do so there are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film and i'd have to say that the flashback sequence of rachel's sister zelda is the number one honestly that is one of the most disgusting disturbing things i've ever seen in a horror film it's not gory and bloody it's just flat out sickening one thing's for sure that image won't leave your head anytime soon br br the performances in this film were all very up to par and i really had no problem there this film is actually on the gory side there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there including the shocker of an ending i really liked the way they ended the film it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive but it worked better that way with all things considered br br overall pet sematary is a good horror movie that i'd recommend to those who are fans of either stephen king or just fans of the genre in general the story is the film's greatest asset and it's a creepy one too one of the better stephen king adaptations i'd say 7 10
<START> i grew up in royersford pa the town where jerry's market was i remember my whole family going out to watch the filming i remember a guy showing the blob to me and my brothers in a bucket i also would like to share that my mother was in the movie her hair style was the same as aneta corsaut's and she was ill one evening and they saw my mom and asked her to sit in the car with steve mcqueen for some shots from behind they payed her 25 00 and gave her a story to tell until she passed away this past august my mom was not a teenager and she was a few months from giving birth to my little sister
<START> i waited and waited for this film to come out the trailers seemed to be on for years it was worth it i'm not a big fan of watching films over and over again but i cant wait for this to come out for all to buy not a big fan of jim but this suited him perfectly there was so much to see and the 'feel good factor' is off the scale perfect for christmas i think ron did a fab job turning this into a film if you haven't seen it then do so if you have watch it again i know you want to
<START> when i first saw this film in london in 1958 i was bowled over i had never seen a film like this before it had a strange hypnotic effect quite unlike the films that i had seen previously and it left a lasting impact br br i believe that odile versios marina vlady are sisters if not twins certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer br br if this has been converted to dvd in region 2 format and in the original french language i would love to hear about it where it can be purchased
<START> rain or shine outside you enter a movie house it makes you happy if not come right out lights go off you settle down with a bar of ice cream moving pictures begin to flicker on the screen you feel content in the dark you are back in the beginning of time sitting around the campfire looking at the modern version of the flickering flames 24 times per second and sharing the joy of discovering the unknown turns and twists of the scenario with rest of your clan spectators br br those who are not happy with themselves should not write comments long live romantic comedies
