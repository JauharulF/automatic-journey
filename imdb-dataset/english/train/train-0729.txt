<START> i watched this movie last night and already i am struggling to recollect very much about it the story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony they fly to the moon in a space age dustbin carrier when there they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the moonbase br br it strikes me that rubbish low budget sci fi films often involve either desert planets or like this movie criminals escaping from penal colonies why this is i have no idea but i can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical this one is really no exception it begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half way alright dance music soundtrack it then degenerates into a boring sci fi thriller so little of consequence actually happens in this movie that i am literally struggling to write a helpful review so if you're reading this i apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the film's subtleties and nuances for the record i recall a tedious bunch of baddies a tedious bunch of goodies some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman other than that i'm struggling br br if you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then i would not hesitate to recommend this film i would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets
<START> eddie murphy spends his time looking for lost children so when a very special magical child is kidnapped in tibet the sexy charlotte lewis asks for his help to rescue this child from the clutches of evil itself br br although the story is a bit silly it never quite feels corny despite the hilarity of the comedy throughout the film charles dance off sets the comedy with his very serious and dark characterisation of the evil that holds the child hostage br br the golden child is very funny action packed and really quite compelling in a charming almost magical way br br 7 10 great for all generations
<START> not only was he invariably annoying to listen to but he had no jokes i swear some fobby asian guy telling yo momma jokes would've been funnier than leary's crap well maybe funny for a couple minutes but at least i'll be able to laugh at least once leary claimed he stopped taking drugs during one of his jokes apparently he was still high on something he was just some crackhead imprecating rants mostly drug related one of his jokes was something like 'i wouldn't use crack especially having the same name as between my ass' oh man how did he come up with that one i swear the only guy that needs to shut the f k up is denis leary thank god i didn't have to see him live this guy totally sucks br br if you're easily amused by swearing and jokes where you can come up with yourself then waste your time with this junk
<START> one of the those coming of age films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids this movie has neither it is a poor excuse to let sylvia kristel's body double frolic with a dorky eric brown to make matters worse the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny sexy or dramatic laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for emmanuelle needs a body double as the movie went on and on i started to imagine a hybrid of private lessons and little miss millions that had sylvia kristel seduce jennifer love hewitt as howard hesseman makes us nostalgic for wkrp watch this to laugh at other people's stupidity or for ed begley jr 's committed performance or to wonder what sylvia kristel would look like with jennifer love hewitt but i can give you an idea of your lesson stay away from movies staring sylvia kristel that are not emmanuelle
<START> recap doctor markov has developed a new theory how to produce energy knowledge that might unbalance the world he keeps his knowledge coded and secret and desperately wants out of the soviet union kgb on the other side desperately wants the new technology so they sets a scheme in motion during a rescue attempt to free markov kgb steps in takes markov to a secret location and lures him to reveal his secret by saying they are in sweden and working for the un as a backup kgb kidnaps markov's estranged daughter cia now send their best agents a team of swedish ninjas to thwart kgb and rescue markov and his daughter br br comments a cult movie that despite not being very good needs seeing the movie is quite ambitious but lacking in many areas first off is that it is very dark probably to conceal locations and bad effects that some scenes are hard to comprehend you can't see what is happening the second thing that it is lacking is martial arts despite being a ninja movie sure there are some of quite poor quality but mostly the ninjas fires automatic guns or sets of explosions the automatic guns pose a problem too as they seem to have a endless supply of ammunition and the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets while soviet guards die like flies br br what does it have that speaks for it then the idea and ambition foremost some actually and especially for a swedish movie decent action scenes albeit not of martial arts some nice slow motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore and some very interesting new weapons technology that makes the victims heart or brain explode mostly all parts that you look for in a b movie br br because it definitely is a b movie no mistake could be made there but if you expect it and watch it like a b movie it is entertaining but don't forget it is not only a b movie it is set in the eighties some girls for example besides wearing lets say interesting clothes have lethal doses of eye shadow and makeup br br in all see for the cult status and the ambition enjoy it and then forget it br br 4 10
<START> raw force is like an ultra sleazy and perverted version of love boat with additional kung fu fights demented cannibalistic monks white slaves trade energetic zombies and a whole lot of lousy acting performances no wonder this movie was included in the recently released grindhouse experience 20 movie box set it's got everything exploitation fanatics are looking for blend in a totally incoherent and seemingly improvised script the production values are extremely poor and the technical aspects are pathetic but the amounts of gratuitous violence sex can hardly be described the film opens at a tropically sunny location called warriors island where a troop of sneering monks raise the dead for no apparent reason other than to turn them into kung fu fighters the monks also buy sexy slaves from a sleazy hitler look alike businessman supposedly because the women's flesh supplies them with the required powers to increase their zombie army tourists on a passing cruise ship among them three martial arts fighters a female la cop and a whole bunch of ravishing but dim witted ladies are attacked by the hitler guy's goons because they were planning an excursion to warriors island their lifeboat washes ashore the island anyway and the monks challenge the survivors to a fighting test with their zombies okay how does that sound for a crazy midnight horror movie mess it's not over yet because raw force also has piranhas wild boat orgies cameron mitchell in yet another embarrassing lead role and 70's exploitation duchess camille keaton i spit on your grave in an utterly insignificant cameo appearance there's loads of badly realized gore including axe massacres and decapitations hammy jokes and bad taste romance the trash value of this movie will literally leave you speechless the evil monks' background remains naturally unexplained and they don't even become punished for their questionable hobbies maybe that's why the movie stops with to be continued instead of with the end the sequel never came unless it's so obscure imdb doesn't even list it
<START> for those of you who have read rohinton mistry's highly respected novel this film will definitely impress you because of how honorable an adaptation it is with the exception of one minor subplot sturla gunnarson's feature film debut is an almost dead on recreation of the book down to the last line br br for those of you who have not read the novel this movie might be a little tricky it is certainly not a large cinematic drama story instead it has a strong element of realism to it but i would not have it any other way the best way to describe such a long journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale hindu version of 'fiddler on the roof' instead of a jewish russian milkman the protagonist gustad noble is a banker in 1970's bombay during the time of the muslim hindi war with pakistan he is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life including his sick daughter his individualist eldest son a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money and an unhealthy neighborhood the ending is not a happy one nor is it a sad one but that is essentially what realism involves br br such a long journey is a fine little movie but if you want to see it then good luck finding it unlike the novel it has received very little release
<START> this movie is an eye opener for those who can only the glamorous lifestyles of the stars it tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to plus the bomb blast scene is very real br br what you read and are taught just does not happen br br can raise your bp level by 10 br br all actors played their role very well br br some scenes may could have been avoided to include teenagers br br this movie is quite adult in nature br br not a movie that can be seen with family br br casting is great
<START> let me start out by saying that i used to really like betty grable particularly from down argentine way but by the time she got around to this disaster she had also got round and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment costarred with douglas fairbanks jnr who must have been fairly desperate the story was bad the colours good and the film far too long it had some of the old standbys in it like harry davenport and reginald gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success the music score was woeful and i have to say not one tune was memorable in any way as i was such a fan of miss grable i always wish i had never seen this one
<START> i watched this film because i noticed that it had kari wuhrer in the cast i have long had a theory about her that she is a talented actress but never seems to get to prove that because she is always in this sort of low budget b movie she is still beautiful and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material i always see her in this is no different the film is often ugly and disturbing but that doesn't make it good george wendt played against type and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role another note about ms wuhrer her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since i saw her last perhaps reduction surgery or more likely removal of implants this not a bad thing she still looks great i would like to see her in a better movie
<START> it is an excellent thriller from turkey which can make sense great job from gokbakar brothers br br first of all i want to point on screen play generally screen play in most films from turkey is not enough but gen has the best shots to be said perfect and also transition parts are really excellent br br on the other hand gen has a great topic that influence everyone especially a woman who wants to be a psyciatrist in a sanitarium has a mother that is a habitual insanity principal causes and psychological consequences are given in gen the only thing you have to do is to combine all the hints br br there is an impressive aggression part doga rutkay and sahan gokbakar played this performance may be more realistic than irrÃ©versible monica bellucci br br the last thing i want to say is watch this movie you'll get confused
<START> oh god what a horrible horrible film meant to be a comment on the state of society it's just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality tv interstitials hosted by jason jones and don mckellar are the most obnoxious part written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful rather these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting condescending speech that shoves the meaning of the film down the viewer's throat br br also a point to would be filmmakers long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity br br if anyone out there is interested in watching this film please don't seriously please you have better things to do
<START> i saw this film for the very first time several years ago and was hooked up in an instant it is great and much better than j f k cause you always have to think 'can it happen to me can i become a murderer ' you cannot turn of the tv or your vcr without thinking about the plot and the end which you should'nt miss under any circumstances
<START> this is the best picture about baseball since redford whacked the natural our way dennis quaid and rachel griffiths light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to pull you into their lives br br laced with dreams dripping in reality the american dream reignites after 9 11 with a true story about the devil ray's mid life rookie jimmy morris australian born actress rachel griffiths plays a native west texan better than a lot of texans i know and dennis quaid was perfection Â cast as the wannabe gonnabe and humble winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience it's real the on screen chemistry works if you like baseball heart warmers you're going to love this film the ingredients for americana and apple pie were all in there my popcorn became the Âa la mode' br br and hey buy the cd the music rocks and carries the story magnificently syncing words and music pushes the story forward exactly the way it should an area that disappoints me more often than not br br criticisms i'd have given the baseball to somebody else but quaid has something to teach us all about Âcharacter' and heart st rita and the nuns were a nice decoration but they never really found their place in the story to open and close around them a little long worth every minute in the last analysis 8 10 br br
<START> this is almost like two films one literate and engaging the other stupid and clichÃ©d it's really a shame all the problems weren't worked out with the writing but considering how quickly most b movies were written and produced this isn't too unusual it's a real shame though as this could have been a very good film br br first the good the movie is original and involves wwii code breakers this is pretty fascinating and i liked watching the leading man lee bowman go through his paces as a master code breaker in fact the first two thirds of the film was very good but now for the bad the film just went on way too long and lost steam at about 50 minutes additionally jean rogers' role as the kooky girlfriend must rank as one of the worst written and distracting roles in film history for every smart move made by bowman the idiot rogers then stepped in to screw things up as some sort of misguided comedy relief if her role had been intelligently written the overall film would have improved immensely instead watching her it's hard to understand how we actually won wwii
<START> i watch cold case because of the real life experiences depicted this one was very close to me and touched me deeply so beautifully handled thanks merideth all the characters are well developed 3d especially coop the material is still difficult to approach the us is far behind the developed nations of the world only this kind of honest actual experiential portrayal and treatment makes an impact on the population of course not everyone sees things the same way but i am heartened that 3 4 of the men polled in the under 30 crowd voted the same as me 10 you're reaching the hard ones i will forever reserve the best episode place for this episode please continue taking chances and accept my heartfelt gratitude
<START> greetings again from the darkness what a relief a thriller that actually is thrilling new it girl rachel mcadams wedding crashers and the notebook dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director wes craven scream movies and a nightmare on elm street craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane br br what makes this one work is the realism of the first 15 20 minutes as we see mcadams interact with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone she is a natural when she meets cillian murphy the scarecrow in batman begins in what appears to be happenstance the film really takes flight watching the two yuppie types flirt while the audience knows something evil is brewing is bewitching film making the plane boarding sequence is mesmerizing and the 30 plus minutes onboard is excruciatingly claustrophobic craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescue br br as with many thrillers the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero an interesting plot device leads us to believe little rachel has the necessary pent up frustration to see this through but we can't help but cringe a bit the most overdone scenes involve irate hotel guests an annoying airline passenger cillian's injury and the fx at the hotel the strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads sadly the fine screen veteran brian cox is under utilized but overall this is an above average suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale
<START> as a dane i'm proud of the handful of good danish movies that have been produced in recent years it's a terrible shame however that this surge in quality has led the majority of danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism in fact it has become so bad that i no longer trust any reviews of danish movies and as a result i have stopped watching them in theaters br br i know it's wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie so let me stress that villa paranoia would be a terrible film under any circumstances the fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with danish film furthermore waiting until it came out on dvd was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money br br erik clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in copenhagen settings i particularly enjoyed de frigjorte 1993 as an actor he is usually funny though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies namely that of a working class slob who's down on his luck partly because he's a slob but mostly because of society and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community br br this is problem number one in villa paranoia clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible br br it is much worse however that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on for instance the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near death experience of the main character with the use of low budget effects and bad camera work after that the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge this is symptomatic of the whole movie there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters and clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is telling instead of showing thus at one point you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels because the script wouldn't allow him to act out his feelings and later on voice over is abruptly introduced quite possibly as an afterthought to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the director's ineptitude fortunately at this point you're roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters let alone the so called story br br the acting which has frequently been a problem in clausen's movies can be summed up in one sad statement sÃ¸ren westerberg bentsen whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on big brother is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the cast br br i give this a 2 out of 10 rating
<START> now i had the best intentions when watching this one i like some of tony scott's work also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie even though i heard otherwise from other people but this was simply hopeless br br in my humble opinion tony scott was trying too hard it was all just too much allow me to elaborate br br miss knightley was overacting and not in a good way the people who did perform well were mickey rourke edgar ramirez and christopher walken but their screen time just wasn't able to save the movie br br there were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer a certain tune was used around 4 times which really started to bug after the second time i'm a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once br br also the editing really went out on this one as the cutting rate is rather high oh and the repetitive echoing of some of keira's lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second third fourth time and so on br br basically my opinion is that if you want to see an action flick that is high paced and somewhat funny and you don't care about everything i mentioned above you might like it br br on a side note i'm not a keira knightley fan
<START> mr mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time so i was interested to see what he'd do with total creative control over a movie sadly it is unwatchable though not because the jokes aren't funny some i won't say most of them are and in fact mr mike did a good job translating his mentally unbalanced screeds into visual gags the trouble is that the technical quality sets lighting sound editing you name it is so god awful the movie is intolerable some outfit called pko productions gets the producing credit but it doesn't look produced at all it looks more like mike stole one of the cameras from the snl set and made the whole thing in an afternoon i realize mike's goal was to torture the audience but even that deserves some basic standards such as the ability to actually see hear or comprehend whatever it is that's supposed to be shocking still the dvd isn't a total waste it includes a eulogy for o'donoghue by bill murray and three mr mike's least loved bedtime stories from snl plus the cat swimming section of the movie is a great scene to be caught watching if you want to freak someone out 3 10
