<START> this is a film that on the surface would seem to be all about j edgar hoover giving himself a a big pat on the back for fighting klansmen going after indian killers hunting the famous gangsters of the 1930's fighting nazi's in the us and south america during world war 2 and commies in new york during the early 1950's of course in 1959 we did not know about mr hoover's obsession for keeping secret files on honest americans bugging people like the rev martin luther king jr but worst of all his secret love affair with his deputy director clyde tolson if you want to know more about that subject i suggest seeing the film citizen cohn hoover aside this story of a life in the fbi as told by jimmy stewart makes for a decent but dated film vera miles as his devoted wife is also good but jimmy is the movie as much as hoover controlled production and always made sure the fbi was seen without fault jimmy stewart gave the film a human side quite an achievement considering hoover was always looking over his shoulder the background score is also pleasant i have read recent online articles suggesting that this is a forgotten film jimmy stewart was one of the greatest film stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten tcm was the last network to show it a long time ago and i hope they show it again
<START> ok so it may not be the award winning movie of the year type film apart from the brilliant soundtrack that i think won a few awards but it is a really great film about 'the kid' prince o take your pick and the happenings around him living in minneapolis playing his music the music is absolutely superb in my opinion you have to own this soundtrack it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion and the movie itself plays out a nice plot it's worth seeing over and over again espeically if you like prince o which i do of course
<START> i saw this on tv so long ago that i can't remember when it was but it still stands out as one of the scariest most unnerving films i've ever seen there is a simultaneously subtle but intense dread induced by the woman in black lurking at the edge of the frame not quite clearly visible so that you feel like the solicitor hero unsure whether its just imagination or not it is also one of the few films which has really made me fearful to keep watching production values be hanged good films are about a director's ability to create atmosphere using film actors locations sets music attention to detail and imagination a real gem
<START> this movie is horrible if you pay attention to it it's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen each one with no apparent connection to the next i rented this movie because i'm a david bowie fan and i really appreciate musicals in finality bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired the moral of the story was really befuddling i couldn't tell if it was about racial issues in london in the 1950s or about not selling out for the first half of the movie i was chuckling at how cheesy it was but i liked the campiness of the no selling out message when blacks started being murdered i thought my tape had gotten messed up maybe i rented half of two different movies nope there was a keep britain white song and dance sequence i'm sorry but wwii is not something you can write a musical about at least not a musical that could conceivably be described as campy as i have several times in this review overall i'd say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors and put david bowie in it for longer goddammit my grade c
<START> on the 28th of december 1895 in the grand cafÃ© in paris film history was writing itself while louis lumiÃ¨re showed his short films all single shots to a paying audience 'la sortie des usines lumiÃ¨re' was the first film to be played and i wish i was there not only to see the film but also the reactions of the audience br br we start with closed doors of the lumiÃ¨re factory apparently since the image seems a photograph people thought they were just going to see a slide show not something they were hoping for but then the doors open and people are streaming out heading home first a lot of women then some men and one man on a bike with a big dog when they are all out the doors close again br br whether this is the first film or not some say 'l'arrivÃ©e d'un train Ã  la ciotat' was the first film lumiÃ¨re recorded it is an impressive piece of early cinema being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons one simple reason it is only fifty seconds long but also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here you don't get to see historical things like this every day
<START> when i started watching fay grim i had no idea that it was a sequel to henry fool now the latter was not a movie that i envisioned as having a sequel but one has arrived and it's quite good i assume that you've seen the original so i won't explain it this one starts with fay parker posey living with her son whom she had with deadbeat henry thomas jay ryan simon james urbaniak is still in jail one day the son gets expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school but this is no ordinary toy it holds a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie and this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than syriana br br i must say that i'm quite impressed with what hal hartley has accomplished here maybe this one doesn't quite reach the original's quality but it certainly takes a good look at what's going on in the world and the end leaves open the possibility for another sequel br br also starring jeff goldblum
<START> and all through the house is a special crypt episode not only because it's from the first season but this episode was the first one i saw i remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in south carolina on hbo i saw this episode and i was buried to the crypt right then and forever i had always been a fan of horror suspense series and liked monster movies and with this series started by hbo i again had fearful pleasure this episode being the first one i saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites it's just so enjoyable with a nice twist and all through the house has a nice cozy setting on a snowy christmas eve which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday chopping well anyway you have mary ellen trainor who by the way plays in several warner brothers works usually small parts as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve the odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as santa escapes from a local nut house making for a late holiday chopping on christmas eve as from the old e c comic lessons you learn bad people get what they axe for well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured joan collins this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all time
<START> with iphigenia mikhali cacoyannis is perhaps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient greek theatre to the screen his own screenplay an adaptation of euripides' tragedy was far from easy compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed the story has been very carefully deconstructed from euripides' version and placed in a logical strictly chronological framework better conforming to the modern methods of cinematic story telling cacoyannis also added some characters to his film that do not appear in euripides' tragedy odysseus calchas and the army this was done in order to make some of euripides' points regarding war the church and government clearer finally cacoyannis' iphigenia ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to euripides' br br the film was shot on location at aulis the director of photography giorgos arvanitis shows us a rugged but beautiful greece where since the homeric days time seems to have stood still he takes advantage of the bodies the arid land the ruins the intense light and the darkness the harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters the camera uses the whole gamut of available shots from the very long reinforcing the vastness and desolation of the landscape as well as the human scale involved to the extreme close ups dissecting and probing deep into the soul of the tormented characters in particular the film's opening with a bold accelerating tracking shot along a line of beached boats followed by an aerial view of the many thousands of soldiers lying listlessly on the beach is a very effective means of communicating agamemnon's awesome political and military responsibility br br no word but sublime can describe the stunning performances of costa kazakos agamemnon irene papas clytemnestra and tatiana papamoschou iphigenia kazakos and papas embody the sublimity of the classical greece tragedy kazakos' character is extremely down to earth and his powerful look into the camera more than his words reveals the unbelievable torment tearing his soul irene papas is the modern quintessence of classic greek plays in iphigenia she is terrible in her anguish and even more so for what we know will be her vengeance tatiana papamoskou in her first role on the screen is outstanding in her portray of the innocent iphigenia which contrasts with kazakos' austere depiction of her father agamemnon br br cacoyannis is faithful to euripides in his representation of the other characters odysseus is a sly scheming politician achilles a vain narcissistic warrior menalaus is self centered obsessed with his honor eager to be avenged and to have his wife and property restored br br the costumes and sets are realistic no hollywood there agamemnon's quarters resembles a barn he dresses as do the others in utilitarian hand woven simple garb clytemnestra's royal caravan is made up of rough hewn wooden carts br br the music is by the prolific contemporary music composer mikis theodorakis theodorakis' score intensifies the dramatic and cinematographic unfolding reflects on the psychological aspect of the tragedy and accentuates its dimensions and actuality br br this film and the story it narrates offer considerable insight into the lost world of ancient greek thought that was the crucible for so much of our modern civilization it teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures euripides questions the value of war and patriotism when measured against the simple virtues of family and love and reflects on woman's vulnerable position in a world of manly violence in his adaptation of euripides' tragedy cacoyannis revisits all of these themes in a modern clear and dramatic fashion br br the relationships governing the political machinations are clearly demonstrated war corrupts and destroys the human soul to such an extent that neither the individual nor the group can function normally any longer with the possible exception of menelaus whose honor has been tarnished by his own wife's elopement with her lover everyone else has his own private motivation for going to war with troy which has nothing to do with helen the thirst for power agamemnon greed the army odysseus or glory achilles and so in a real sense helen became the wmd of the trojan war the war stripped of all homeric glamor and religious sanctioning was just an imperialist venture spurred primarily by the desire for material gain all else being a convenient pretext br br another conflict raised in the film is that between the church and the state calchas who represents the church feeling the challenge to his priestly authority and wishing to destroy agamemnon for the insult to the goddess he serves tells him to sacrifice his daughter in consenting to the sacrifice the king comes closer to his moral undoing but in refusing loses his power over the masses his army who are brainwashed by religion of course for agamemnon it's a game the king must go along with the charade whether he honestly believes in the gods or not until he realizes too late that he has ensnared himself into committing a despicable filicide br br is it a sacrifice or a murder and how can we tell the difference between the two by focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrifice and worst of all the sacrifice of one's own child euripides cacoyannis creates a drama that is at once deeply political and agonizingly personal it touches on a most complex and delicate ethical problem facing any society the dire conflict between the needs of the individual versus those of the society in the case of iphigenia however as in the biblical tale of abraham and isaac the father is asked to kill his own child by his own hand what sort of god would insist on such payment can it be just or moral even if divinely inspired finally does the daughter's sacrificial death differ from the deaths of all the sons and daughters who are being sent to war these are many deep questions raised by a two hour film
<START> alicia silverstone pre clueless plays a modern day crime obsessed teenager attempting to solve the brutal slaying of a local girl pat verducci wrote and directed this b flick which isn't especially well made but is however surprisingly serious minded in regards to its leading character silverstone is appealing and successful in carving out an interesting young woman here despite the picture's kitschy undermining the supporting cast including kevin dillon and michael bowen isn't bad though the violence in the last act goes overboard not a cheesy camp fest but nothing exceptionally memorable either 1 2 from
<START> the seventh sign borrows a lot from rosemary's baby and the omen it actually blends the two stories even its title recalls bergman' s the seventh seal br br nevertheless it begins well enough with all the omens scattered on the whole earth and in parallel a seemingly distinct plot with moore's husband trying to save a poor boy who killed his parents who were brother and sister from death penalty this time both christian and jewish religions are called to the rescue even the wandering jew is involved which makes the lines sometimes unintentionally funny have you ever been to sunday school but they taught me that god was love the best scene imho is the short dialog between priest john heard who does not seem to take things seriously too bad he was not given a more important part because his laid back acting is priceless and the young jew br br demi moore probably registered the same desire as ex husband bruce willis saving the world she does not save the movie for all that
<START> this is probably one of the worst movies ever made it's terrible but it's so good it's probably best if you don't watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining because you're going to be disappointed however if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and goro's fantastic hair bad english you're in for a real treat the harder you think about the film the worse it gets unless you're having a competition to spot the most plot holes screw ups in which case you've got hours of entertainment ahead i'd only really recommend this film for the bored or the die hard smap fans and even then the latter should be a bit careful because goro's japanese fans were a bit upset about it they thought he was selling himself out he wasn't really not when johnny kitagawa who was the executive producer can do that for him
<START> fate stay night is an animated series inspired by a h game somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h stuff it couldn't have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way it's pictured in this series and any alteration of that could only ruin perfection you'll understand once you see all the episodes br br despite a relatively slow start the producer took his time on presenting the characters things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid series the action gets so intense that glues you to your seat br br the topic of the series concentrates on the war of holy grail that has been taking place in the fukuky city for the last 50 years the pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city he unwillingly witnesses a fight between two servants that triggers his reiju holy mark to summon one of the most powerful servants of the battlefield saber his first contact with saber left him stunned such immeasurable beauty i was at a lost for words br br you mustn't compare this series with any other to fully understand it's plot fsn offers much more than some cool sword fights good animation spectacular lights great soundtrack it offers excellent character and relationship development it presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events precipitate the action reveals believable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals not similar to the linear type other series use that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal from under the mask of perfection flawed characters br br the saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such you shouldn't watch fsn thinking that it doesn't present the viewer with the historic fact just remember that this is adventure fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can the ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes i would have watched them in the same breath
<START> i saw this movie at the afi dallas festival most of the audience including my wife enjoyed this comedy drama but i didn't it stars lucas haas brick alpha dog molly parker kissed the five senses hollywoodland and adam scott first snow art school confidential the director is matt bissonnette who's married to molly parker all three actors do a fine job in this movie about 3 friends the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third it all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful the film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama and i thought it needed to be the other way around
<START> a classic cartoon always enjoyable and funny it has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters road rovers is a show worth seeing it is a short 13 episodes and if you can ever manage a chance to see it you should unfortunately it is very hard to find i think warner brothers studios should release a dvd that contains all 13 episodes i would definitely buy it if they did and if they do you should buy it too if you have kids who like dogs they will love road rovers road rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was
<START> this movie is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re animates the dead he first uses it on his brother when he is shot dead in a drive by his brother then infects the other gang members in some scenes the zombies are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast which makes little sense the acting is mediocre but the story doesn't help the film the makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies the budget for this film i'm sure was very limited i believe the film could have been better made had the story been more original and with a better budget if you wan't to see a good zombie flick don't see this one
<START> want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentleman's club that's what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end this is the worst slasher film i have ever seen but every time i was ready to switch the channel they'd add another scene with the workout girls and i'd stay put as a slasher film killer workout fails in every category i can think of as a showcase for beautiful girls working out it is a success strong recommendation to avoid unless the thought of half the film being a big t a show appeals to you
<START> it is not known whether marilyn monroe ever met and spoke with albert einstein and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death we may never know but in their lifetime the opportunity was there br br scripted by terry johnson from his own play nicolas roeg's insignificance imagines an encounter in a new york hotel room one night in 1953 between the two icons plus joe dimaggio busey and senator joseph mccarthy curtis but only on one level on another level it elevates or reduces these 'personalities' and what a lousy phrase that is to mere avatars the characters are deliberately unnamed at once greater and lesser in status br br the title insignificance is both apposite and deeply ironic here dimaggio's net worth has been reduced to little more than a picture on a bubblegum card monroe too is reduced to her constituent parts of dress hair lipstick wiggle and voice by uncovering their insecurities and reversing their roles the film brings into sharp focus received notions of celebrity exploding the cult of personality br br furthering the theme there will be another explosion at the film's climax hiroshima in a hotel suite in which 'the actress' is burned to a cinder in seconds a literal deconstruction of fame goodbye norma jean history informs the script which in turn shakes history upside down as roeg mused after watching johnson's play for the first time these characters were mythic not invented by any single person not the public or the press probably not even by the characters themselves as played by theresa russell marilyn a closet intellectual in real life lectures a childlike einstein 'the professor' played by emil on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight while getting the professor to show off his legs in conscious parody of her own role in the seven year itch the movie the actress is seen to be working on in the film's opening br br history records that monroe's then husband fading baseball star dimaggio played by busey as a tenderly psychotic simpleton was unhappy about her iconic dress splaying scene in the film precipitating their break up right on cue we discover the jealous 'ballplayer' in a bar bemoaning the fact that if i want to see her underwear i just walk down to the corner like all the other guys br br in contrast to the professor the ballplayer believes the universe is round a contention shared by native americans but the big chief sampson of one flew over the cuckoo's nest fame who operates the roosevelt hotel's elevator has been all but disenfranchised from his own culture i no longer cherokee i watch tv meanwhile 'the senator' is investigating the professor who is on the eve of delivering a pacifist speech to the united nations but whom the senator suspects is a red in fact as he divulges to monroe einstein is wracked with guilt over hiroshima and what the white heat future holds yet in a seemingly godless universe all such worries and aspirations are rendered insignificant in the light of a higher atomic power br br roeg really is the perfect director to bring johnson's stage play to the screen throughout tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flash forwards ka boom draw unexpected connections between time place and circumstance with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark time's passing but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time each moment co existing as evinced by his back catalogue it's something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of synchronicity see don't look now in particular here 1920 bleeds into 1945 and drip feeds into the 1980s a period in which another 'actor' has taken on his greatest role as the president of the united states br br if all this sounds rather heavy going quantum physics is surely involved the execution is anything but owing to johnson's witty zippy screenplay roeg's playful direction opening out an essentially stagey set up and the cast themselves who are on stellar form tony curtis especially leaves denture marks in the wood panelling as the paranoid impotent senator who is seen attempting congress with a monroe impersonator a real one as opposed to russell's before being let down by his dwindling member br br of course curtis once co starred with the real marilyn monroe in some like it hot and whose embrace he memorably described as like kissing hitler as roeg commented everything suddenly seemed connected when the film began to take shape even the actors themselves seemed part of this endless linking it all goes into the pot to be boiled down and served up in new and fascinating ways
<START> i agree with most of the other guys a waste of photons and valuable time br br nearly no joke is worth the paper is was written on the only highlight from my pov is olli dittrich as pinocchio egal ich muss eh waldsterben this reminds of old times with rtl samstag nacht it is hard to describe the performances of the actors since most of them don't even seem to have a good time during production and just do their thing camera is ok plot is laughable i think you would be ashamed even if you discuss this with lots of beers br br apart from this i yawned all the time wondered about how a script like this could even be considered for production and waited for the end br br my 9 year old son was pleased but then he is pleased by so little at this age br br anyway a 1 point rating here nearly is 1 point too much
<START> this is a classic british comedy thriller i had always wanted to check out but no opportunity had arisen for that until now it's based on a popular stage play which had already been filmed a number of times previously most notably in 1931 by the same director but unfortunately this version seems not to have survived in its entirety for the remake under review the plot has been updated to the then current wartime situation br br anyway i was mainly familiar with early british comedians through the films of will hay given that this one features a similar plot of legendary hauntings smuggling and enemy agents it's very much in that vein it was actually scripted by hay's regular writing team of marriott edgar val guest and j o c orton the stranded travelers element then was an equally tried and true formula the star this time around is arthur askey abetted by richard murdoch none of whose films i had watched before who is as unlikely a hero as hay himself and whose personality proves to be just as potentially irritating but one soon warms up to him and askey certainly comes up with a number of witty lines and amusing bits of business throughout to justify the fact that the lead character of the play and the 1931 film version was split into two here with murdoch acting as the star's straight partner br br the remote single setting the events of the film largely take place during one stormy night provides for some wonderful atmosphere the last half hour with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple raymond huntley and linden travers and eventually the arrival of the titular vehicle itself is especially gripping and well handled also worth mentioning from the remaining cast list is kathleen harrison as the stereotypical frightened spinster with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement to take her very first drink
<START> i was curious to watch this movie a lot of people seem to be excited i also have my beliefs i believe in jesus christ but i'm opened for any kind of views or opinions it doesn't matter for me if jesus existed in the way it's written in the bible if maria was a virgin or not or all the other similar pagan coincidences what matters for me is the idea of salvation the idea of love as the only way to find peace in this world br br what made me angry is when somebody takes a sentence present it as a fact but without showing the context it was written for example they showed in this movie following sentence big those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them bring them here and kill them in front of me jesus lukas 19 27 what they didn't tell you is the context jesus told a story about an evil king there is no passage in the bible where jesus supports killing he is love after quoting the bible wrong they present us yelling people pseudo christians filled with hate the majority of viewers don't check the informations presented so they start thinking jesus hate not good for me or for anybody else this is pure manipulation people please use your brain don't take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie we destroy our own basis our civilization if we start dismantling jesus in this way and the message he brought to us you saw off the branch you're sitting on
