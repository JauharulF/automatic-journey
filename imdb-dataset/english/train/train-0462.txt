<START> canadian director vincenzo natali took the art house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube which is my personal favourite sf film of the 90s it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube shot entirely on one set and took this idea in fascinating directions br br i've been eagerly awaiting natali's follow up and although its taken five years for him to mount another project i'm delighted to say it was worth the wait cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man's place in the world and how through a completely logical chain of events finds himself in a situation beyond his control br br i don't want to reveal too much about the plot because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it's head cypher is such a film br br morgan sullivan jeremy northam one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet is hired by the company digicorp they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars to his bewilderment they are unbelievably boring covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese br br while morgan is waiting for one seminar he runs into rita foster an impeccably cast lucy liu the definition of an ice maiden she gives him the brush off but there is something to her he finds irresistible that's not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in br br when rita turns up at another one of morgan's seminars she tells him his life is not what it appears and i'm not saying anything more about the plot to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us as well as the tortuous path that's so much fun to follow br br as with cube natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people taking them out of the familiar and basically seeing what will happen when they're thrust into the unknown and cypher follows similar patterns but it's not a carbon copy of cube it has it's own inspiration br br cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle it's as much of a shock to us as it is to him br br one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns cypher is also on a low budget but natali economises it as much as he can allowing him to broaden the horizon and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity br br natali's direction is exceptional with a deft hand on the reins there are some amazing camera angles from above such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film noir br br the acting is uniformly excellent throughout jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity his performance is excellent because it's so modulated he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes from a clinical spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity br br david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black his scene is one of the best because it's an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia he is a supposed expert in identifying double agents and it's a fantastic piece of writing brilliantly acted by hewlett all he has to do is look at morgan and we're drawn into his complex mind game br br but it's lucy liu who's the scene stealer here too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect but in cypher she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove rita is an aloof guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone br br things come to a very gratifying end that doesn't conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did but morgan deserves his happy ending after he's been put through the ringer like this i cheered for him in the final scene it's a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes br br cypher succeeds on all counts engaging shocking always entertaining it's everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn't and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix br br a fine follow up from natali and now i'm a committed fan of the man superb stuff
<START> this is a complex documentary that shows many things about early gay life to put it in perspective it was when gay was the word used for the homo sexual revolution and not just gay as a descriptor or is it still used that way today i believe most of the film comes from circa 1968 to 1989 it was released in 1993 so it's been around br br i was touched by the documentaries capturing of one man's love for another over a 20 some odd year period a love expressed in ways that only true love can be there are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain along with scenes of joy and pleasure there are scenes of life as a homo sexual and life as a gay the film itself was a work of love and i believe it to be a diamond br br at the very least one will get out of this film an understanding of the devastating impact of aids as i write this i am thinking how much earlier this film seems to me to have been set the advances in medical political and social sciences and culture that have taken place since this film was set some 15 years ago are amazing however obviously in the case of the disease of aids itself we are not done yet heck i guess we aren't done on all fronts br br anyway it's just a pretty darn good documentary i'd encourage anyone that feels that they don't quite understand gay life gay issues or the devastation of aids to watch this film
<START> maybe television will be as brutal one day maybe Âbig brother was only the first step in the direction stephen Ârichard bachmann king described the end point of but enough about that if i spend too much words talking about the serious background topic of this movie i do exactly what the producers hoped by choosing this material it's the same with Âthe 6th day no matter how primitive the film is it provokes a discussion about its topic which serves the producers as publicity let's not be taken in by that the social criticism that is suggested by that plot summary is only an alibi to make it possible to produce a speculative violent movie more for video sale than for cinema br br i didn't read the book i don't dare criticising stephen king without having read him but when i saw the film i thought they couldn't make such a terrible film out of a good book in a typical 1980s set with 1980s music and some minor actors arnold schwarzenegger finds himself as a policeman running away from killers within a cruel tv show the audience is cheering br br together with Âpredator this is definitely schwarzenegger's most stupid movie 2 stars out of 10
<START> poor whoopi goldberg imagine her at a friend's dinner party and she adds a comment to the in depth political discussion going on people just look at her and say oh what would you know you were the star of 'theodore rex' how could anyone take her seriously after she lowered herself to be the star of this appalling piece of crap even little kids would be cringing in horror at this thing it reminded me of a particularly bad episode of 'sigmund and the sea monsters' actually come to think of it 'sigmund' was vastly superior to this br br and however did it get made by plying the producer with an illegal substance before telling him about it watch this hideous abomination at your own peril
<START> i have a 5 minute rule sometimes i'll leave leway for 10 if a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes it's probably not going to ever get better i have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory dan in real life is definitely no exception i was watching this turkey and thought wow this is not funny not touching not sad and i don't like any of the characters at all br br the story of an advice columnist widower raising three young daughters who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend i suppose the tagline would be advice columnist who could use advice i don't know dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice i guess that's the irony i don't know he goes to see his parents brothers sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat which seems very sweet and potential fodder for good comedy story lines none which ever emerge the central story is basically how he loves this woman but can't have her anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he will get her but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny trite lifetime movie network dialogue murderer of love to get to the inevitable happy ending br br this is truly one of the worst movies i've ever seen
<START> this film is so bad it simply defies reality the filming is grade school material at best the acting is pathetic and the director should forever be banished from film making in any form so bad it can't even be watched as comedy such something along the lines of showgirls the only thing this dvd had going for it was the cover art br br all i can write to those of you who haven't had the misfortune to witness this is to please do yourself a well deserved favor in advance and don't waste your time or your money on this piece of garbage if you want to see a movie for the comedy aspects there are many other more worthy in such a realm than this trash
<START> it's very sly for all of the 60's look to the movie the humor is quite gentle but it grew on me much more than i expected the cast is first rate and they appear to be having a wonderful time ustinov wanders through the film muttering some quite funny things under his breath and it's all very inconsequential i'll buy the movie as soon as it comes out on dvd the plot is that ustinov as an embezzler released from prison posing as a computer whiz and embezzling money from an american company with an office in london maggie smith is his secretary for a while and watching her get fired from many different jobs is part of the fun bob newhart is his usual deadpan self and karl malden has fun as the dense and sleazy executive running the london office the ending is funny and nicely cynical
<START> as a community theater actor who works hard at it but doesn't take acting too seriously i'm always amused by those who treat it as great art this movie skewers the actor's craft mercilessly while dishing up a lot of good laughs br br a ham actor on location for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator when the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drink and food the actor is kidnapped and forced to play the part of a lifetime by the neo nazi head of the secret service he plays it to the hilt gets the dictator's girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa and turns the tables on his captors beautifully br br lots of great shtick by the leads lots of good work by some unknown supporting actors particularly the household staff and two members of the palace guard and fun little cameos abound sammy davis jr makes light of himself jonathan winters plays a semi retired american businessman with something else going on and raul julia sonia braga and above all richard dreyfuss are exceptional br br this is a dumb movie but it has lots of beautiful locations in brazil a humorous script and good actors doing their thing and looking like they're actually having fun and not going through the usual existential angst about what is only play acting
<START> henry thomas was great his character held my attention i was so into the story that i forgot it wasn't real i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character the way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring i love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself
<START> i have always been somewhat underwhelmed by joe dante's original the howling 1981 Â so i wasn't particularly interested in checking out any of its sequels some time ago i did catch howling iii the marsupials 1987 Â by the same director as this one Â and found it to be watchable but nothing special br br the second instalment however has quite a bad rep and i knew i'd have a good time watching it Â if mainly to wallow in the sight of dear but pompous horror icon christopher lee squirming in the midst of it all the gracefully aged star has pathetically asserted a number of times in interviews that he hasn't appeared in horror oriented fare since his last picture for hammer films back in 1976 anyway this film should have borne the subtitle your movie is a turd Â being astoundingly inept in all departments beginning with the all important werewolf make up br br the plot and dialogue is not only terrible but it has the limpest connection with dante's film Â strangely enough the author of the original novel gary brandner co wrote this himself still one of the undeniable highlights er low points of the film is the pointless elliptical editing Â which tries to give the whole a semblance of style but only serves to accentuate its embarrassment factor similarly phoney and grating are the hokey transitions between scenes the inane punk rock theme song and the cheapjack special effects at the climax br br what about the characters then lee is the werewolf expert naturally whom everybody thinks a crackpot Â until they come into contact with the monsters that is at the very least though one has to admire the makers' ingenuity or gall in devising a stupid subtitle with a dual meaning incidentally sybil danning as stirba werewolf bitch Â the subtitle by which this is known in the u k is quite fetching in an assortment of outrageous s m outfits but her character is virtually given nothing to do except preside over her brood of followers and engage in the occasional hilarious three way lycanthrope sex her two snarling lieutenants one of them a sluttish black girl are especially irritating br br aiding lee on the side of good are the two yuppie heroes he being the brother of the dee wallace character from the first film and she a colleague of hers and a ragged guerrilla type band of transylvians still they generally manage to effortlessly overcome danning's rather dumb werewolves notable among them is a knife throwing dwarf who gets a particularly nasty but at the same time side splitting demise he's later revived under stirba's control in order to lure lee by making childish taunts at him all through the village streets into a trap the latter scene has to be a career nadir for the distinguished and imposing actor Â well either this or the early sequence in a discotheque where lee is made to don a pair of ultra cool sunglasses so as to appear inconspicuous among the partying youngsters br br in the end if i were forced to mention elements in this which weren't entirely displeasing i guess i could say that the ossuary set in which the heroine is to be sacrificed is interesting or that the hybrid werewolf bat creature danning's pet who likes to 'inhabit' the body of its victims is just too weird to be despised
<START> i think this would have been a much better film if the cajuns had been portrayed in a more believable light my family is from the southeast region of louisiana and i live in southeast texas about 20 miles from lake charles i have never heard the people i grew up around talk like these folks did the cajuns were portrayed as backwards rednecks most of the cajuns i know are well educated proud people and don't sound uneducated at all when they talk the way these people did all in all it was an ok movie with great scenery and music i understand that the writers were from lake charles and have knowledge of the area but for the love of all things cajun please have the actors study the language live amongst the people you are portraying and get an all around understanding of how they are before you go trying to act like them in my opinion when the actors make you believe they are that person it's a much more enjoyable movie
<START> it definitely fits the time period as the axis allies were playing espionage games throughout most of north africa the rest of the world it's not the best of films but certainly not the worst of the budget films as described previously from the compilation war classics br br duncan cisco kid renaldo was actually very good in one of his first feature films i really enjoyed the performance of harry parke credited as parkyarkarkus why he never got any bigger roles is beyond me he played the perfect buddy partner role and saved the movie imho br br as said this film was part of a budget package from superbox mart entitled war classics eight movies for eight bucks which included other never heard from films that has some decent stars trying to pay the bills br br this script is well not so hot the editing cinematography is worse if you can by pass all of that and want to see the future cisco kid a great sidekick that sadly never fulfilled his true potential definitely pick it up otherwise there's other ww2 films to watch br br thunderossa
<START> this was a disappointing film for me it came to me via a boxed set entitled classic film noir which was a gift from someone who knows i typically enjoy films done in that style i insist that noir is a style not a genre i do not think it is a noir film at all there seems to be a tendency these days to label and market every black and white b movie made from 1947 to 1955 as noir and the label does not always fit there is a persecuted male protagonist ed cullen lee j cobb and most of the film's action takes place indoors those are just about the only noir elements that i could see there is no pervasive paranoia or any real reason why one should sympathize with ed cullen jane wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale i do not want to spoil this film for potential viewers however i would be interested in hearing what other connoisseurs of film noir have to say about it
<START> i agree with most of the columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods this movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past and that is the disturbing point because columbo is no ordinary detective br br there are two parts in this film that left me intriguing first i can't figure out the title of this movie it is misleading maybe a better title would've been the vanishing bride or something similar second columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason to the viewers at least why he does it br br i don't feel betrayed just disappointed i'm glad peter falk went back to the usual columbo br br
<START> i love all of the movies by michael landon jr and michael landon jr's casting of dale midkiff as clark davis could not of been any better dale midkiff has the ways to pull off this character br br this movie kept me spellbound from start to finish br br the death of missie willies baby girl with the timing of clarks visit was only gods timing how they dealt with the death and how clark helped them do so was that of a fathers love br br although there are 3 movies before this one love comes softly loves enduring promise loves long journey i feel you can see this movie and understand it easily yet leave and want to see the previous 3 movies due to the history all the characters have behind them br br michael landon jr is an excellent director br br i look forward to many more movies from him in the future
<START> she has been catapulted from 13 to 30 with magic dust involved courtesy the 13 year old matt but nothing is made of that except as an unexplained device new york city especially central park but also every other slice of the place incorporated into the movie seems hope filled and easily livable and save for lucy there's no villain in jenna's adult life and even lucy is not cast as monstrous only as a nasty 13 year old grown 17 years more devious chris the one time boy object of jenna's yearning is now a porky cab driver and you have seen enough films to know that matt will play a major role in jenna's future you don't know quite what might impede this before it is finally achieved though i'm here to whisper in your ear so to speak that the device is not unique in fact not only is this a variation on the theme of tom hanks' big though nowhere near as fine it is also a strictly by the book version of this subset of the cinderella story
<START> i shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad that has been done in great detail already many times over the 'plot' started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide boy gangster by numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves it is now 7 or 8 years since i watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film i have ever seen br br i am only making these comments and indeed the only reason i went to see the film is because of the amusing fact that my brother eddie appeared in it as the second 'heavy' in the pub scene it was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards rhys ifan's face in the bar in 'russia' it was actually filmed at the former butlins holiday camp at barry island my brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever he had recently joined an extras' agency and this was his first part having seen the film it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever br br i remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema and this was just a couple of days after it had been released i have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast and rightly so in case you were thinking of renting this film on dvd i would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red hot then jam them into your eye sockets this will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film
<START> i couldn't wait to get my hands on this one when i read about fred astaire teaming up with george burns gracie allen in a movie with a script by p g wodehouse and music by the gershwins it is definitely worth seeing but lacks the cohesive quality of the fred ginger movies br br the story would probably be better to read in a wodehouse book where the humor comes across better some of the acting is downright painful to watch notably the young boy and the damsel br br but the funhouse dance is worth more than most movies i never knew that gracie allen could dance but boy does she in this movie have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse imagine tapdancing on one in high heels she keeps up wonderfully with astaire and adds greatly to the overall quality of the picture br br several nice songs particularly fun are nice work if you can get it and stiff upper lip br br recommended for fans of astaire burns allen i had to go back and re watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled
<START> after watching this on the mst3k episode i have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from it seems to combine elements of logans run farenheight 451 final sacrifice and at least several others at one point i was really expecting cris makepease to call lee majors rowsdower br br i wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot like the fact that even though gas is unavailable there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations and the stations are located close enough together to keep an f1 race car going all the way across the country
<START> here's another film that doesn't really need much of a recommendation it's a classic comedy very funny and entertaining and which of course ultimately inspired a successful television series which many would say was even better i enjoy both personally br br for some it's hard to warm up to jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix unger and oscar madison when they were were weaned on the tv show starring tony randall and jack klugman or perhaps vice versa but what we've got there in both cases are four good actors who in real life seemed so much like their film counterparts that they managed to make these characterizations their own it's neil simon's humorous material that's key and where the laughs really originate from br br for those who have somehow never heard of the odd couple it's the story of a neurotic and fussy neat freak lemmon who is thrown out of a 12 year marriage by his long suffering wife and takes up residence in the manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy matthau pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some hugely funny predicaments
