<START> okay i rented this movie because of the director he has made some interesting flicks in the past if you haven't seen waxork you are missing a fun ride anyway i had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but i decided to suck it up and give it a look it's bad very bad if you haven't seen the movie and don't mind spoilers read ahead first of all the old saying 'you can't judge a book by it's cover' applies here the box for this flick seems to indicate that jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights the back of the box has a cool shot of the red leather jill and some other shots the description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good you start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place inexplicably in 1977 jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover the movie is not quite as predictable as you would think and that's not a good thing characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivation it's embarrassing to watch 10 minutes before the end of the movie dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason also what was the point of having dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him anthony hickox the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script had it been set in the underworld of the new milennium and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent to set it in the 70's makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever avoid it
<START> this movie feels so empty in every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like 10 because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird br br the acting was horrible it's so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the actor actress wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives looking at the floor for their marks br br spoilers also you'll find yourself banging your head watching the movie at one point at sky captain's home base they have like 100 planes sitting on the airstrip they have advanced warning an attack is coming so what do they do nothing all of the planes get blown up and yet again the only person fighting back is the sky captain br br the entire world is under attack and he's the only person ever fighting back at the very end of the movie you see hundreds of plains taking off finally but what do they do nothing the movie is over
<START> it may have not been up for academy awards and admittedly it's pretty cheesy but it's just so much fun nothing makes me smile like bill and ted lovable optimistic and hilarious bill and ted are a great way to unwind br br although i love excellent adventure bogus journey is funnier to me death is flippin hilarious and bill and ted are even more endearing people give me grief about loving this movie but only really pretentious movie watchers will say it's not even a bit entertaining if you like this you'll probably also be a fan of wayne's world dude where's my car and dumb and dumber admit it though foolish they make you grin and turn your tickle box over so watch them just for kicks and giggles
<START> two kinds of movies we like are 1 westerns and 2 movies from 30 or 40 years ago we ought to have liked a man called sledge but br br but this picture is disagreeable annoying and stupid from start to finish since there is nobody in the story good or bad to warm up to there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested no camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it sledge has a pretty girl friend but there's no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no account pig br br the film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score and from extremely bad writing and direction by vic morrow br br of the last 30 older movies rented from netflix or video vault this was the rock bottom the only true dud in the bunch
<START> this is the best movie i have ever seen br br i've seen the movie on dutch television sometime in 1988 br br that month they were showing a yugoslavian movie every sunday night br br the next week there was another great movie involving a train rather than a bus the name of which i don't remember if you know it please let me know in any case how can i get to see this movie again a dvd of this movie where please tell me at vannoord let rug nl br br the next week there was another great movie involving a train rather than a bus the name of which i don't remember if you know it please let me know in any case how can i get to see this movie again a dvd of this movie where please tell me at vannoord let rug nl
<START> as a fan of author john le carre i've slowly been working my way through both his books and the adaptations of them i found this 1987 adaptation of le carre's masterwork at my local library and sat down to watch it thinking i would know what to expect i was surprised to discover that my expectations were exceeded in this miniseries a fine cross between a spy thriller and a human drama br br peter egan gives a great performance as magnus pym the perfect spy of the title carrying on in the long tradition of le carre's strong main characters pym is also quite possibly the best egan plays pym who in fact contains many shades of author le carre as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and betraying sometimes out of circumstance and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming a perfect spy egan plays pym to perfection as a man always on the run if not from others then from himself egan alone makes the six or so hours of this miniseries worth seeing from his performance alone br br surronding egan is a fantastic supporting cast ray mcanally gives one of his finest performances as pym's con man father rick who as le carre has said is based strongly on the author's own father mcanally plays a man who comes in and out of pym's life and is one of the those responsible for pym becoming a perfect spy in fact if it wasn't for mcanally's performance a year after this in a very british coup this would the finest performance of his sadly too short career br br the rest of the supporting is excellent as well from caroline john as pym's mother to alan howard as his spy mentor to rÃ¼diger weigang as the young pym's friend turned controller to jane booker as pym's wife the supporting cast is fantastic special mention should be made of the three young actors who played the younger pym jonathan haley nicholas haley and benedict taylor who establish the young man who would become the man played so well by peter egan br br the production values of the miniseries are strong as well as the miniseries adaptations of tinker tailor soldier spy and smiley's people proved these stories can only be told in miniseries format the locations are excellent from the english locations to the those scattered across eastern europe and the usa as are the sets by chris edwards the cinematography of elmer cossey adds an extra layer of realism to the world of the miniseries yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script br br screenwrtier arthur hopcraft tackled the job of adapting the six hundred or so page novel excellently the novel was largely at least in its early parts autobiographical in that pym's early life echoed much of john le carre's life the script for this miniseries is no exception as it traces the development of magnus pym from young boy to a perfect spy never once does the miniseries deviate from its purpose of telling a fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage if one ever wants proof that a spy thriller can be tense and fascinating without ever having one gun fight fist fight or james bond style car chase this would be the proof while the miniseries is six plus hours long it never wastes a moment and it all the better for it br br though it might be overlong for some for those who don't have very short attention spans here is a must see from the performances of peter egan and ray mcanally to fine production values and a fine literary script a perfect spy is one of the finest miniseries who can expect to see it is a fascinating trip down the history of the cold war yet it is more then that it is also a trip down what john le carre has called the secret path the path of the spy the man who must lie and betray to survive as much a human drama as a spy thriller a perfect spy isn't to be missed
<START> remakes and sequels have been a staple of cinema from the beginning of the media it is pretty much a hit or miss venture though if you take what's good of the original and build upon it and update key features too current standards you can have a success note such films like the thief of bagdad 1924 1940 or king kong 1933 2005 succeeded in their attempts others like king kong 1976 fail miserably br br brief encounter 1945 is the template for this film it is as perfect as could be made on such a subject and we rate it imdb ten the story is simple love innocently found by accident and tragically lost why it just happened for the two 2 principals involved at the wrong time these are portrayed in a convincing and sensitive manner by trevor howard and cecilia johnson neither are conventionally leading star material but quality character actors for the details watch the film br br now what went wrong a t v movie remade practically scene for scene with name actors richard burton and sophia loren should have at least scored imdb six both actors though appear disinterested just showing up to punch their time clocks and pick up their checks neither are involved with their characters or with each other you do not believe they are in love or when they finally separate it is any great loss to either of them that should not be and that's why it fails in its intent sometimes it is just better to leave things alone
<START> this film revolves as much around japanese culture as it does the lives of one modern japanese family physical contact is frowned upon for those over 7 especially in public hence all that bowing instead of hugging even when you are close friends relatives ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else and that in public too never the less ballroom dancing is on the quite immensely popular people who do ballroom dancing in japan are viewed a bit like nudists in the west many more would like to than do but are inhibited by the culture a delightful family film which any amateur dancer would enjoy for the dance sequences alone i understand that it was more popular than titanic in japan i guess the japanese are just like the rest of us they like to be hugged too
<START> the story for the first aired television installment of columbo is simple one half of successful mystery writing team does away with the other frames an unseen mafia group is blackmailed by an admirer does away with the admirer and is tricked up by the stalwart columbo br br with that said this is still one of the most entertaining in the show's history benefiting tremendously by the work of the late jack cassidy and star peter falk br br besides the notability of being directed by a young steven spielberg the episode also has a air of the macabre because of the future of two of its stars cassidy and barbara colby the two share several scenes together and it is poignant that both would die tragically within a decade of this filming cassidy in an apartment fire and colby at the hands of assailants yet to be found after over three decades br br now both demises are true life mysteries
<START> adorable i saw domestic import in philly in october with my kids we all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents i haven't heard them laugh like that in years it was the first time that i can remember seeing a movie that my parents and my kids could enjoy it's really cute and we can't wait for it to come out on dvd they need to make more movies like domestic import it is refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy and not be embarrassed i have not seen a movie this cute since my big fat greek wedding i loved mindy sterling as the mother she was also in austin powers howard hesseman is in this too and he is hilarious i remember him from wkrp
<START> starting off here's a synopsis porno queen alta lee lynn lowry is murdered by her pornographer lover max george shannon in a game of sexual russian roulette alta's other lover icy lesbian casting agent camila stone mary woronov provides an alibi for max but camila has an agenda of her own and a plan involving the seduction of innocent actress julie lynn again in a web of sexual mind games when the lookalikes' identities are sufficiently blurred the stage is set for vengeance as passionate as the most heated carnal encounter br br though this movie is quite obscure and never got much attention i find it to be a sexy suspenseful gem cult goddess woronov has one of her best ever roles and she and sexy innocent lowry play off each other well the unsettling music provided by gershon kingsley plus two original songs all american boy you say you've never let me down and the jaynetts' sally go 'round the roses compose a memorable soundtrack theodore gershuny's direction is sharp with everything photographed in muted earth tones that perfectly suggest unsavory business bubbling under society's upper crust with tons of great new york atmosphere ondine woronov's friend and fellow warholite giving a great performance in a small role and exotic monique van vooren as max's ex wife in a comic sub plot this sub plot though amusing looks like it belongs in another movie altogether however i'm not complaining as the film is smooth even as it changes gears and is a hell of a lot more interesting that the erotic thriller garbage currently being cranked out br br trivia sugar cookies was originally rated x soft core and released by general film corporation in 1973 i am the proud owner of an original one sheet poster lucky me in 1977 the movie was cut for an r and re released by troma team which now offers it uncut on videotape mary woronov was the wife of theodore gershuny at the time and was reportedly uncomfortable performing the graphic lesbian simulated sex scenes with him leering behind the camera she can also be seen in two of his earlier productions kemek 1970 and silent night bloody night 1972
<START> culled from the real life exploits of chuck connors and steve brodie in 1890s new york the bowery is high energy and good natured br br but be warned casual racial epithets flow off the tongues of wallace beery and little jackie cooper the very first shot might be startling this is true to the time it was set and the time it was made and it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the woods it certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere br br beery as connors is the blustering thunder at the center of the action a loud mouth saloon keeper with his own fire brigade and he has a soft spot for ornery orphan cooper raft as brodie is connors' slicker better looking rival in almost every endeavor brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention leading up to a jump off the brooklyn bridge it is still debated whether he actually jumped or used a dummy br br beery is as bombastic as ever with a put on irish american accent he is just the gruff sort of character to draw children cats and ladies in distress this is possibly the most boisterous character raft ever played and he even gets to throw in a little dancing as well as a show of leg and again he mistakes the leading lady lovely fay wray for a prostitute cooper is as tough as either of them though he gets a chance to turn on the tears br br the highlight isn't the jump off the bridge but a no holds barred fistfight between connors and brodie that in closeup looks like a real brawl between the principals it's sure someone bruised more than an ego
<START> i already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire there were numerous political and social messages the names make refer to some other names etc it might be i cannot realize such things i don't want to do anyway because i am not interested in i am interested in 'cinema' as for the movie itself again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful i could not see anything which we don't see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half yes that scene says somethings about humanity but it does not make the movie brilliant the movie is entertaining mildly and exciting in some moments or scenes but no more than that as for the biggest flaw of the movie it is visual effects it was just shocking i could not pull myself together for a while because i had expected a realistic monster because it is not one of the old gojira movies it was made in 2006 but it was not it is like if you don't believe that there is a monster you cannot care about if you agree with me about this i highly recommend you cloverfield that is extremely realistic the design of the monster is not interesting but at least planned there is an effort dramatically powerful critique some critics talk about it as if it is a kurosawa movie yes it is rather a drama than a thriller or action but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful i don't want to compare the host with other monster movies but i try to mean that the host does not do something that other monster movies do not do by the way may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for asian cinema yes i like asian cinema too but this is the fact
<START> i went to the movie theater this afternoon expecting to be underwhelmed by scoop happily the film exceeded expectations at least a little bit it's nothing heavy nothing deep and not anywhere as good as any number of real allen masterpieces but it's also completely enjoyable as a light bantering comedy there's something kind of simple and sweet about it cute was the word i heard from people in the audience as they were walking out after the show it doesn't feel like allen set out to create a masterpiece here it feels like he wanted to make a little comedy and have fun doing it compared to just about everything hollywood is producing allen's stuff has a tendency to charm even the fluffy stuff these days it's just refreshing to go to a movie made by an actual human being
<START> there are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives these once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don't meet these people anymore we don't always even know their names as we are never presented to each other and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are it's funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such because reuniting might spoil fond memories or we don't know do they we are too afraid to check that out br br the movie 'before sunrise' just caught me watching it i never had intention to watch it through but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting i gave a look for the rest of the film i didn't know what to expect from it but nor did the young couple they had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate i believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through it makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives
<START> many reviews here explain the story and characters of 'opening night' in some detail so i won't do that i just want to add my comment that i believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of life br br at the beginning myrtle gordon is remembering how 'easy' it was to act when she was 17 when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth experience has left her emotionally fragile wondering what her life has been for and indeed if she can even continue living a tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her br br almost but not quite at the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself i'm going to bury that bastard she says of fellow actor maurice as she goes on stage it seems almost sadistic when myrtle's director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance he knows however that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at all br br some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on myrtle's downward path i believe this is truly her 'opening night' she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action she sees a way forward it is tremendously moving br br gena rowlands is superb the film is superb thank you mr cassavetes wherever you are
<START> this is one of my favorite movies of all time i loved rain man with dustin hoffman and tom cruise this movie is in some ways similar but makes rain man seem artificial shallow unemotional and trivial by comparison
<START> it seems there's a bit of a curse out there when it comes to gay cinema namely happy endings aren't very common beautiful thing excluded gay films tend to end in broken relationships or untimely death and some like come undone just end period br br the creators of this horrid piece of nonsense have a thing or two to learn about plot direction and timelines within the first ten minutes of this film i found myself a bit confused and even more so after the first glimpse of jeremie elkaim's character having a little psych session it seems this film was randomly pieced together without the slightest attempt at continuity or consistency there's no real way to tell when you're viewing the present or some sort of ethereal flashback i could only take so much before it became truly unappealing br br stephen holden of the new york times called this film shimmeringly beautiful and utterly real well it seems that stephen invested in beer goggles prior to viewing as this is truly far from beautiful due to all the praise this film received i expected something worth watching sadly the film lived down to its title and by the end of the movie which provided no resolution whatsoever i might add it's plain to see that the writers the director and the film have all come undone
<START> it's a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds meryl streep gives the performance of her life melodramatic overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror br br if comedies about the infants being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and yes it is an odd choice of topic for a farce but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that as it focuses on giving streep a showcase for her aussie accent and facial contortions br br throwing in a slam at media bias and sensationalism and disregard for either the truth or ethics gives the movie the chance to make the daring point that those things are bad
<START> this is a wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama it is not really a horror flick so those looking for something like the ring or the grudge will be disappointed what really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to be internally consistent i also appreciated the absence of dr phil psychobabble or new age revisionism rather than advancing an agenda the filmmakers just told the story told it well and let the viewer think about it the sparse dreamscapes were reminiscent of wyeth paintings and amazingly effective br br a great example of how to make a good film on a small budget without big studios star actors big name directors this was far better than many of hitchcock's films special effects or clever plot twists
