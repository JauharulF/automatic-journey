<START> oh well this movie starts off well it's kinda funny and seems like it could be a fun movie then it becomes a bit serious and goes off the rails it sort of wants to be 'boogie nights' but it can't achieve it if only it stayed with the tone of the first quarter of the film
<START> you know our spirit is based on that revolution it's asleep i can explain i think well until that happen on 25th april 1974 our freedom was limited we didn't had liberty of speech but when we got it at the revolution it seems that portuguese people lost his opinion we don't use our liberty of speech that's all a consequence of the revolution i think that's clear about the movie i think that it has a few mistakes on some character's acting but by the way i use to watch on portuguese movies it's quite good i like it very much
<START> ok i had higher hopes for this carnosaur movie simply because it seemed like the sequels were getting better as they came out i did like carnosaur 2 better than 1 i figured well this one is newer so it must be better right well i quickly learned i was wrong i was extremely confused with the casting they brought back rick dean for another spotlight character and michael macdonald as a police officer now for rick dean lol in carnosaur 2 i thought he fit the role pretty well and wasn't really annoyed by him now in carnosaur 3 wow they placed him as an elite soldier now we are getting goofy here the movie actually started out pretty good with a decent gun fight and dinos escaping out of there little freezer trucks but as soon as scott valentines team showed up we had a mix of a romantic comedy with very funny performances from retarded and floppy dinosaurs br br i'll start with the raptors first they had there tails drag the ground which in the second one they were up in the air which looked more common for a dinosaur that can run up to 50 60 mph now when they ran they wiggled back and forth and the heads didn't move at all there hands were floppy all over the place and since they were extremely poorly shot by the director they looked stupid and out of place br br the t rex was extremely pathetic they would of been better off using the one from the previous 2 movies at least that one looked somewhat frightening the one in this film looked like it was smiling all the time the legs when it walked was hilarious like it was john wayne in the old west all stiff legged and stuff lol another thing i noticed is that the hands did not move they were stuck next to its body so it looked and sounded god the sound effects were awful retarded now if i was the director and realized that i had this to work with maybe i would of maybe tried a little bit harder to hide the fakeness fact as for the rest of the movie well this was the sloppiest and loudest military team i have ever seen the weapons they used wouldn't make sense for the scenario they even had an arm wrestling scene inside the warehouse where the carnosaurs were roaming now i was tickled at this scene because i thought that while this stupidity was going on that the dinos would get in there and cause some damage instead the director wasted about 7 minutes of our time i would like to look at this movie as the 3 stooges of dinosaur movies you have retarded military retarded dinosaurs retarded scenario and you have a wonderful 83 minutes to spend of your day watching this br br now i'm not saying i wouldn't watch this bc actually i do recommend everyone see this movie that wants 83 minutes of pure entertainment it may seem like i'm ranting but really i'm hyping this movie up to what it is its really a lot of fun to watch because while watching this you think to yourself did the director really make this seriously
<START> it was on at 7 30am too close to school to see very often the animation computer graphics were spectacular for the time the idea of cowboys ordinary people casually throwing around space vehicles robots was amazing maybe it inspired treasure planet br br unfortunately it's really boring in the dvd format the shows are all basically identical when viewing non sequential episodes on a dvd you're stoned by disk 3 by today's standards the animation is spotty we don't notice the computer graphics anymore and focus on how corny the characters are instead br br the bright spots are the heroine characters they were a lot more believable took themselves more seriously than modern heroines and weren't corny they actually saved men
<START> i know john singleton's a smart guy 'coz he made boyz n the hood so how did he write and direct this it's like the pilot of a bad going away to college for the first time teen soap a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence thrown in to make it a commercial proposition i guess who would've guessed the date rape victim would dump sausage for seafood the angry loner would be preyed upon by a group of neo nazis and would be roomed up with a black and a jew just for laughs even laurence fishburne's creepy reactionary history professor just irritated me and i love the guy it's like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot except busta rhymes of course big ups
<START> most folks might say that if one were to spend a saturday night watching a movie you must be really bored actually i had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the tv and there it was paulie br br i had missed the opening credits so i didn't know the name of it but i saw that it had cheech marin in it so i naturally thought i had tuned into born in east l a when i saw him talking to a talking parrot i was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night br br happy to say it was better than that as you know if you don't already paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner seems it's taken years to find her what should be paulie's advantage is actually a dis advantage in ways people come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves br br while cheech marin's character is making money from him he's not mean to him the dance sequences with the parrots are something kids will find cute i found them amusing br br paulie who's naive' learns quickly that not all humans are nice people especially the owner of an animal research lab the man lies to him saying he'll help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communications research paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of paulie's vocal ability br br throughout the film paulie's telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him several other animals and finding the location of paulie's owner it's a touching reunion br br 8 out of 10 the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown that part might bother younger children otherwise it's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart end
<START> spoilers a bit ridicules made for tv movie has sexy and middle age gold digger isabelle collins susan tucci doing a number on every man she comes in contact with in the movie first winning over their hearts then their wallets and then when their no longer any use to her thrown in the wastepaper basket like a used up kleenex tissue br br isabelle's first victim is non other then her abusive on keeping isabelle from raiding his bank account husband stewart john o'hurley it's later in the movie when isabelle gets very friendly with former plumber and now yacht salesman richard davis philip casnoff that she without really telling him has the totally love sick richard get a contract out on her unsuspecting husbands life getting this ex convict in fact as soon as he's released from prison daggett nicholas campbell to do the job on stewart richard soon finds out that he didn't get exactly what he paid 15 000 00 in cash for br br getting a little too greedy daggett not only blew stewart's brains out but took a solid gold watch that stewart offered him in order to spear his life as well the watch was easily traced to daggett as he tried to pawn it at a local jewelry shop where he was quickly arrested with doggett spilling his guts out on who hired him to whack stewart it doesn't take long for the long arm of the law to arrest stewart's by hiring doggett killer isabelle's husband to be ex plumber and yacht salesman richard davis davis' arrest by the police happens just as he and isabelle took the vows of matrimony in a local church br br isabelle manipulates everyone exclusively men that fall head over heels for her to her advantage by getting them to do her dirty work always playing the part of the naive housewife or widow or lover or even client isabelle seems to live a charmed life always one step ahead of the law and police no matter what she does isabelle covers her pretty behind so well that it's almost impossible to pin her down on any in having others do them of the many crimes that she commits through a second party in the film br br after screwing figuratively as well as literally her first husband steven her second husband for less then ten seconds richard and finally her or richard's attorney gavin kendrick kamar de los rey isabelle knows that it's only a matter of time before the police get wise to her with the d a getting both richard and kendrick to turn evidence against her isabelle now knowing that everything is fast closing in on her makes her final move getting everything in order by transferring all her cash overseas isabelle and her 10 year old daughter ruby lauren collins shoot down to the passport office in order to get clearance passports to get out of the country br br it's then when the cagey and clever isabelle makes her first and possibly last and fatal mistake in the movie isabelle is told by the passport clerk don carrier she'll have to wait a full 48 hours for her and ruby's passport to clear just enough time for the police to find and arrest her outlandish ending that goes against almost everything and every ethic that's in a film noir or crime movie an ending that will not only blow your mind but your concept of what's right and wrong in the world
<START> i did not see this film in the theater i confess to an anti vinnie barbarino bias who the hell was john travolta to be making movies i remember the oscar broadcast that year with travolta looking absolutely devastated when he didn't win how dare he when there were real actors in the running i'm sorry john you should have won after catching this film on cable years ago i fell in love with the entire movie bud sissy uncle bob wes all wonderfully done i also confess to never passing it by when i channel surf i have to stop and watch over the years i've learned to do most of the dialogue dance with my thumbs in my waistband and learned to appreciate travolta more the only disappointing thing to me was the oversight on the soundtrack of some of the music from urban cowboy looking for love defines the film but urban cowboy was chock full of classics that didn't make it to the soundtrack it should have been a double cd
<START> my wife and i both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made certainly in the top ten of those i've watched all the way through at least plan 9 was enjoyable br br i did really enjoy christine the dead zone firestarter carrie and some of his other films i didn't care much for cujo only because the sound was so bad on versions i've seen and i often couldn't tell what people were saying or pet sematary pet cemetery br br but this mess was a total mistake in every way possible the creatures themselves seemed designed by a 9 year old no offense to 9 year olds br br even the one liners made us groan and weren't remotely amusing
<START> yes i have rated this film as one star awful yet it will be in my rotation of christmas movies henceforth this truly is so bad it's good this is another k gordon murray production read buys a really cheap bad mexican movie spends zero money getting it dubbed into english and releases it at kiddie matinÃ©es in the mid 1960's it's a shame i stumbled on this so late in life as i'm sure some mood enhancers would make this an even better experience i'm not going to rehash what so many of the other reviewers have already said a christmas movie with merlin the devil mechanical wind up reindeer and some of the most pathetic child actors i have ever seen bar none i plan on running this over the holidays back to back with kelsey grammar's a christmas carol truly a holiday experience made in hell now if i can only find to all a goodnight aka slayride on dvd i'll have a triple feature that can't be beat you have to see this movie it moves so slowly that i defy you not to touch the fast forward button especially on the two dance routines this thing reeks like an expensive bleu cheese guess you have to get past the stink to enjoy the experience feliz navidad amigos
<START> the days is a typical family drama with a little catch you must relate to the character's emotions in every way possible in order for you to truly appreciate the show br br possible spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the show br br the story obviously for all the people who has watched the show is the world of cooper day the middle child of the family he records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his observations his family includes a mother a father a perfect sister and a genius little brother the first episode which is going to sound a bit stupid since john scott shepard has created this situation both the sister and mother gets pregnant that's the first situation the writer hits then the father quits his job at the law firm the youngest son gets a panic attack the middle child gets in a fight with the sister's boyfriend this is all in a day's work br br spoilers br br i admire this show i don't know it's a bit crappy but i like it first i thought the camera work was a ripoff but then i got used it and started to like it i liked the quiet conversations under a dark light i liked the intimate feeling of the show i liked the low budget style i liked the acting i admire the story then i find myself wanting a second season of the days i slowly became a fan of it as the 6 episode airing on abc came to an end it's a really good show and it's nothing like the oc the two have nothing in common so i hope fans will stop comparing them br br and if you can relate to either abby jack natalie cooper or even nate you'll like this show a lot
<START> but the fun is in the journey br br i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times br br yes it's predictable and yes it's a clichÃ© romantic comedy but the point is that it's a sweet story the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways br br the dialog is dead on and the acting is well done on all parts and over the top for comic effect the bulgari scene is worth it's weight in gold the actress there deserves honorable mention for those that panned it for being predictable if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing then you want a thriller this is a romantic comedy it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life and it has been worth every effort along the way br br great date movie great movie for a happy cry
<START> hey arnold is a slow paced and slightly boring movie the plot is not very creative the paul sorvino character shenk is buying all of the decrepit low priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall shopping complex and office buildings this plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies it is boring paul sorvino is not very exciting either so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary gramps remembers something about a historical document and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when arnold and jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of helga whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to shenk's mall the kids must move around town on buses and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids hey arnold the tv cartoon is usually very entertaining and it has enough humor to appeal to adults the tv cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie hey arnold the movie is about five times more sedated and a good way to put anyone including kiddies to sleep hey arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending if you want to send your kids to a totally non offensive movie this is it i get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie the producers started out with a 30 minute tv cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes this mall story definitely could have been covered in the tv cartoon hopefully arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel
<START> this film caught me off guard when it started out in a cafe located in arizona and a richard grieco rex dead easy '04 decides to have something to eat and gets all hot and bothered over a very hot sexy waitress while rex steps out of the cafe he sees a state trooper and asks him are you fast and then all hell breaks loose in more ways than one nancy allen maggie hewitt dressed to kill '80 is a tv reporter and is always looking for a news scoop to broadcast maggie winds up in a hot tub and rex comes a calling on her to tell her he wants a show down western style with the local top cop in town this is a different film however nancy allen and richard grieco are the only two actors who help this picture together
<START> possible spoilers br br the spy who shagged me is a muchly overrated and over hyped sequel international man of mystery came straight out of the blue it was a lone star that few people had heard of but it was stunningly original had sophisticated humour and ample humour always kept in good taste and had a brilliant cast the spy who shagged me was a lot more commercially advertised and hyped about br br ok i'll admit the first time i saw this film i thought it was very funny but it's only after watching it two or three times that you see all the flaws the acting was ok but heather graham cannot act her performance didn't seem very convincing and she wasn't near as good as liz hurley was in the first one those characters who bloomed in the first one scott evil number 2 etc are thrown into the background hear and don't get many stand alone scenes the film is simply overrun with cameos br br in particular i hated the way they totally disregarded some of the scenes in imom when they killed off vanessa at the start and had basil sat that he knew she was a fembot all along what was the point of that they killed off number 2 in the first one and now they bring him back with no explanation whatsoever this is supposed to be a spy spoof i don't think any of the characters even hold a gun in the film it just goes on a trail further and further away from the point br br the new characters are very unwelcome the whole mini me make fun of my size' joke gets old very quickly fat bastard is just a lame excuse for gross out humour in total there's about two or three good jokes the rest are either tasteless or rehashed from imom br br if this were the first movie of the series then i'd probably be easier on it but the series started on a note of dry wit and then plummeted down to a level of gross out humour so i say only watch this film if you haven't seen its predecessor because the spy who shagged me is one ultimate disappointment
<START> this movie has no plot and no focus yes it's supposed to be a slap stick stupid comedy but the screen writers have no idea what the movie was about even the title doesn't go along with the movie it should have been called cool ethan or cheaters never win or something like that the characters are not developed and no one cares what happens to them the girl roommate character from that 70's show was the only person worth watching she was hilarious and stole every scene she was in the others need to make sure that their own college diplomas are in the works since they'll need a career other than acting
<START> i was one of those few americans that grew up with all of gerry andersen's marvelous creations thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it br br i expected it to be a romp but i did not expect it to aim at such a low age group like lost in space this could have been both visually stunning and exciting it should have focused on more action adventure and the goal of the original series saving people in trouble br br instead it focused on alan saving the day instead of his brothers who were cast too young anyway vs the original the breakout part was lady penelope and parker i didn't care too much for the characters in the original but i was grateful for them in the movie they stole the show br br i always enjoyed thunderbirds more for the high tech than the stories and even that did not get enough screen time as far as i was concerned i would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets br br but then i'm just a big kid
<START> this dvd appears to be targetted at someone who will just put it on and play it in an endless loop in the background it's organized as a series of music videos of the grand canyon set to various pieces of tangerine dream music br br unfortunately the td music is dull and the transfer to dvd looks rather blurry and dim too expensive a dvd for what it is
<START> i started watching the show from the first season and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it original movie was kind of childish and i was just looking for some sci fi show while waiting for the bsg new season br br but after few episodes i became a fan i've loved the characters the not so stupid as you think he is jack o'neill the not only smart samantha carter the glorious teal'c women and kids favorite and brilliant dr daniel jackson br br of course stories sometimes not serious sometimes even ridiculous but mostly it's not about technology or space fighting it's about helping your friend even risking your life for him it's about we don't leave anybody behind struggling to the end when all hope is lost about the free will and all good qualities that makes a human human br br and now it's breaking a record going 10th season and still doing good
<START> okay during this past thanksgiving break whilst having the whole family together everybody decided to go see a movie and since fred clause was voted majority thats what we went and say br br to start off the movie had so many plot holes it was pathetic simple explanations of why a certain event was happening was void example who the heck is trying to 'shut down' santa clause is it some sort of corporation a little explanation would of been lovely br br second the movie tossed you flimsy characters that evoked no sympathy from you about their feelings or actions example the little elf named willie and the only tall girl in the elf village they see each other twice and then they are a couple and i could of cared less because this movie didn't make me care br br third i suppose this was suppose to be a family film its rating was low at just pg for a family film there were several articles of suggestive conversation it didn't bother me but if i were a parent i could see a problem br br through the whole movie paul giamatti looked extremely bored with his role but honestly he was the only one worth watching in the movie vaughn had a few funny moments but played the same character he has for the last two movies mouthy frat boy nothing against vaughn he's been good in other movies br br so this movie gets a 3 out of 10 stars from me just because somebody had to put in the effort to produce film and release this flick br br in my opinion i would definitely pass on this flick or if you have to see it save it for a rainy day rental
