<START> spoilers spoilers packed with memorable moments such as the quote above immortalized by primus deliverance tells the story of four guys who take a trip to the wild woods to go white water rafting and get away from the big city for a while only to find that their fun soon takes a bad turn this is not a hollywood film there are virtually no special effects whatsoever the setting is extremely realistic and nothing at all is sugarcoated or made pretty the city boys look like city boys and even the tough guy louis portrayed with precision by burt reynolds is clearly at the mercy of the wild on this trip this is a perfect example of a what if film what if a few friends went river rafting in an area of the woods that none of them were familiar with and ended up desperately trying to avoid being tried and convicted for murders that they were forced to commit to save their own lives br br there is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with societal and class structure and the relationship or lack thereof between rural and urban peoples when the four guys arrive in the woods early in the film they clearly do not quite know how to interact with the people who live out there and they speak to them as though they are unsure whether they will understand or be able to communicate this communication block is most memorably illustrated in the dueling banjoes scene in which they are trying to gas up the car and truck and get someone to drive the vehicles downriver for them while drew and the obviously inbred and probably mentally deficient boy on the porch are dueling with their guitar and banjo one of the best scenes in the film louis is having some difficulty buying the gas and bobby makes a comment about genetic deficiencies and how pathetic it all is when the boy turns away from drew who had offered to shake his hand after their stupendous jam session bobby tells him to give the kid a couple bucks knowing that none of them are quite sure how to react br br this is the kind of thing that we see in deliverance that sets up so much of the tension that is to follow this great scene where a lot of fun was had including the funniest 'redneck dancing' scene until o brother where art thou ended with everyone awkwardly unsure what to do around each other these people are apples and oranges and they live by completely different rules of life the people that louis bobby drew and ed encounter in the hills grew up separated from modern society and modern laws and live by the rules of nature which do not include thou shalt not kill confused by their awkward behavior the four friends set out on the river hoping for the weirdness to end and for the adventure to begin br br spoilers when they are briefly separated from each other and ed and bobby run into the hillbillies beside the river who quickly turn unpleasant the uncertainty about the way that these people live which was established by the scene above comes into play to create the most tension during the scene i think that a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the film namely the assaults and actual murders takes up a very small amount of screen time but remain some of the most memorable parts of the film there is no gratuitous violence here it's all there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a startlingly powerful effect br br the move is about the violent clash of two very different kinds of people and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with each other the trip down the rest of the river after the assault which takes up the majority of the film delivers some spectacularly effective tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat while not bombarding you with so much happening that you become numb it is surprisingly effective when we find out that ed may very well have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff and the tension in the film doesn't even let up when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river because they deliver a questionable explanation to the police about what happened up there on the river and why the deputy's brother in law is missing br br this is a very disturbing film which is a testament to its success because it's pretty obvious that a film like this is meant to shake people up a little bit the hillbillies are the human i e more realistic version of the sub human rednecks seen in childish but fairly similar films like gator bait and gator bait 2 neither of which could possibly ever be compared to a timeless film like deliverance when we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the woods the natural element is so real and we get to know the men so well and in such a subtle fashion that it's almost like we as individuals of the audience are really a fifth member of the team it's not often that a film is able to come across that way
<START> this was the third remake of sleeping with the eniemy after yaarana 1995 and agnisakshi 1996 br br agnisakshi was the only one which worked and was a better film br br daraar is directed by abbas mustan who sadly failed in their attempt here br br the story was good but the handling wasn't that good and the heroine was shown too regressive and the climax too was disappointing br br direction is bad music is good br br rishi reprises his role of yaarana strangely which also was a remake of swte and looks too fat for the lead and is okay juhi is decent while arbaaz tries too hard in his debut and does manage in many scenes to chill the audiences but his voice was terrible johny is too loud
<START> as the 2000's came to a close king kong's adopted daughter went ahead and made a tearful announcement her show as coming to an end br br while miss winfrey was tearing up i was laughing and screaming like a wild indian from the old west br br so what does oprah do she takes famous people and puts them on her show what kind of famous people people who've suffered just like her except these people have lost more than their virginity they've suffered melted faces true story missing limbs true story see end of paragraph and spousal abuse too many to count and somehow they come on the show and tell their story as if we haven't heard it before tons and tons of times bethany hamilton i've heard your tale about losing an arm to a shark since day one which was october 31st 2003 don't tell me you have no hard feelings but the biggest thing probably on oprah was michael jackson's interview in 1993 after being accused of being a child molester sadly mr jackson has since passed away but that one particular show told about michael's personal life something not many people knew about at the time br br oprah's real influence comes from middle aged women and soccer moms they seem to think she's like a personal jesus sometimes but all i see in oprah is some big ghetto lady who made it big and she's just showing off how rich she is br br i'm glad her shows going to end soon we need better television programs
<START> this is the who at their most powerful although before the masterwork who's next which would provide anthems like baba o'reily and wont get fooled again this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70's br br daltrey shows what being a front man is all about entwistle steady as ever br br moon is great check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech and see him playing side saddle whilst having a bass drum head replaced br br townsend even looks like he's enjoying himself occasionally br br considering they took to the stage at 2am no one in the crowd was asleep br br there are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in 36 years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one
<START> i can't remember many details about the show but i remember how passionate i was about it and how i was determined not to miss any episodes unfortunately at the time we had no vcr so i haven't ever seen the series again however i can remember strongly how i felt while watching it and how thrilled i was every time it came on sam waterstone was my favorite actor these days i think i was almost in love and he remains one of my favorite actors to the day mostly due to his appearance in the series i would gladly buy steal download this series i think i would go to great lengths in order to see it again and revisit a childhood long gone any ideas does anybody knows of a site devoted to the series or has the episodes on tape from their first airing
<START> a solid b movie br br i like jake weber his understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over the top performances i liked the relationship between the father and son i liked the family dynamics the wendigo looks silly but it is a representation of the kid's toy and the dead deer it's an amalgamation like see this is a psychological story not a freddy slash em up instant gratification flick watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you and you'll be fine br br nice work
<START> somewhere near the bottom of the film studio ladder you can find companies like u f o troma and beneath them lie seduction cinema br br seduction is a direct to video production company that specialize in lesbian themed non hardcore erotic movies it has developed a very dedicated fan base that purchase each new title as they are released but sadly the company has become too closely associated with frequent star misty mundae i say sadly because recent mainstream interest and her appearance on the show masters of horrors has caused her to set her sights a little higher than the zero budget s c efforts which forces the company to find a new identity but back in their glory days they released this film on a very appreciative world br br the gorgeous misty mundae is forced to attend a boarding school at the request of a absent father at the school she meets her absurdly hot room mate played by ruby larocca who immediately has designs on her but the headmistress barbara joyce has other plans in typical s c style the movie stops every ten minutes for a extended sex scene but unlike most of their efforts this one has a somewhat interesting story and a couple of good performances ms larocca appears to be having a great time as the sexual predator who views misty as a tasty meal and darian caine makes a welcome though brief appearance as satan this is the sort of film that jess franco would crank out in the 70s although this one does not have the hardcore sex that franco was always willing to throw in for foreign sales and fans of that madman's work would be wise to give this one a go br br to me as a long time zero budget cinema fan and troma worshiper i came across the seduction cinema films through their parody films playmate of the apes who wants to be a erotic billionaire but i actually prefer their more original works you either see past the low budget and occasionally weak acting or you get hung up on these things and just hate all of these films for me the most obvious thing that unites these no budget movies is a real sense of fun these low budget companies are able to create their own unique style which gives the viewer something very different from the bland by the numbers studio efforts that load up the multiplexes br br if you have never seen a seduction cinema film either this or sin sisters featuring both of the mundae sisters are excellent choices to begin with this one is a fun fast paced film although the frequent exterior shots of the school do get a little old and the dvd is totally loaded with extras including a ton of previews of other company offerings a great behind the scenes featurette and some deleted scenes including a alternate opening i do recommend you pass on the disc's bonus feature the first film by director as it is quite weak and not really worth viewing
<START> this movie re wrote film history in every way no one cares what anyone thinks about this movie because it transcends criticism every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it it is an extremely beautiful movie and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again i've seen it more times than i care to count and i still become transfixed every time with a feeling which is hard to describe one for the ages
<START> i actually didn't start watching the show until it came on fx i was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show's reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it i was so upset that i had not watched the show when it first aired on t v i loved the show so much finally a show for everyone to enjoy i remember full house and family matters and step by step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough they would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid but not that 70s show that 70s show was hilarious smart and so real i think it was the best show ever made and i'm very sorry that it ended although i love this show i do think it should have ended on the seventh season when eric and kelso leave the last season was just not right eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves i still love this show and i hope tv starts making more shows like this one
<START> anyone find it interesting that the ood look strangely similar to the 'great cthulhu' of h p lovecraft vintage hmmm br br great pair of episodes not referring to billie piper as most seem to do in the impossible planet and the satan pit br br also the link to 'legion' i think also used in who before and also referring to satan in various novels post exorcist era br br great suspense episodes utilising fear and faith elements the new team for these 'who's are working great magic for tv br br this certainly creates new fears and 'hide behind the sofa' feelings not seen for many many years in this continuation of a superb bbc series pity it is confirmed by the bbc that billie piper is quitting perhaps not permanently after end of series 2 o
<START> i was excited when i heard they were finally making this horrific event into a movie the whole era 1980's southern california and subject matter drug and porn industry is intriguing to me i thought this would be a sure fire hit i was not thrilled with the choice of kilmer as holmes they do not resemble each other in physical appearance or mannerisms i guess he sells tickets however i was willing to overlook this and give it a fair shot i was a bit shocked that there were only like four other people in the entire theater with me on that first day of showing now the whole crime and story in the film is hard to do i will admit that there were no witnesses to this very violent and brutal act john holmes was there but he was also a pathological liar and worried about what would happen to his family and self if he talked to police about it in fact holmes never really testified about what happened and the crime did go unsolved so this was still really one big mystery a mystery that this movie does nothing to cast light on the person writing the screenplay had a whole lot of discretion and most of the principal characters are dead however there is no real storyline it is fragmented claptrap the script is light and the actors try to hard to beef up paper thin lines by overacting the film gives no insight into holmes or the other people involved kilmer's character disappears for long stretches his girlfriend is dull the police are jokes even kudrow tries hard to make a flimsy role look substantial it is a very shallow piece and dare i say boring the director even tries to turn it into a love story which is nice unless you know anything about what a piece of trash john holmes really was perhaps a couple of viewings of anderson's boogie nights might have helped here boogie nights was innovative and exciting in all regards this film on the other hand was flat and without any real charm or style even the music is out of place with duran duran being played in a scene that was supposed to have taken place in 1980 then we have gordon lightfoot gordon lightfoot there could have been a great film based on this gruesome event but i have not seen it yet i have not seen even a decent one yet unless you consider the rahad jackson scene from boogie nights
<START> if you like othello you'll love this flick since half the movie revolves around the stage production of the play br br the film has a great cast with signe hasso and shelley winters as the women in colman's life while edmond o'brien plays the enterprising press agent br br a couple of the supporting players i particularly liked were millard mitchell as the grizzled reporter who finds an angle and joe sawyer the 1940's answer to drew carey who plays the cop on the case br br great raw moments in this one with noir realism throughout
<START> okay there are a ton of reviews here what can i possibly add br br i will try anyway br br the reason this is my favorite scrooge is because of everything the sets outdoor locations costumes are so beautiful and authentic the music is sweet the supporting cast is very well done one of my favorites is the narrator nephew played by roger rees his understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of christmas to me david warner is also a totally believable bob cratchit his is a difficult life but he remains positive and dignified br br the best part of course is george c scott as ebenezer scrooge some have said his portrayal too gruff i couldn't disagree more his exchanges at the beginning while cold or harsh weren't out of character he is a terribly disillusioned man who's heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth br br during the flashbacks it's obvious that he isn't all gruff this is where we see that there is hope for him if he was totally gone his partner marley would never have come for his sake in the first place and after all we are none of us past hoping i think that is a huge part of what dickens was trying to say when scrooge looks in on his dance at his employer's with belle you see him smile regretfully as he tells belle in the flashback that he will go through life with a grin on my face clive donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film sometimes they get left on the editing room floor br br and finally his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy every time i see it his apology to his nephew fred so sincere so moving it is the spirit not only of christmas but of humanity itself the joy he brings to fred to his wife are so apparent and the line that gets me every time god forgive me for the time i've wasted br br bravi tutti
<START> this movie was rented by a friend her choice is normally good i read the cover first and was expecting a good movie although it br br was a horror movie which i don't prefer but no horror came to mind while watching the movie it was a dull br br not very entertaining movie the appearance of denise richards br br was again a pleasure for the eye but that's it we the four of us br br we're a little bit disappointed but feel free to see this movie and br br judge it yourself
<START> forbidden planet rates as landmark in science fiction carefully staying within hard aspects of the genre science not fantasy ergo nerds will love it while still playing with imagery and ideas of contemporary 1950s values morbius's isolated house is a model of modern design with open spaces that step out into sculpted gardens a swimming pool and the ultimate home appliance robby the robot a housewife's dream exclaims the captain after lunch and a demonstration of the robot's abilities to synthesize food and disintegrate waste br br also revealing to the 1950s fruedian psychology rears its head in the id explanation although morbius dismisses it as an outdated concept there is a touch of the pacific war drama in the battle with the invisible monster and life aboard the saucer perhaps most timely is the post atomic fear that science is the enemy and arrogant scientists will unwittingly bring down destruction in their blind quest for knowledge br br yet the suburban drama presented by forbidden planet seems uniquely fresh in the sci fi genre they aren't swashbucklers or heroes but ordinary sailors crossing the galaxy with a serviceman's crudeness and honesty the good guys drive the flying saucer and the aliens are so long gone we don't even know what they looked like although their music er atmospheric tonalities by bebe and louis barron are remarkably futuristic today the views from morbius' house are truly alien with jagged cliffs and pink bonsais the interior of the saucer is just this side of buck rogers there's a lot visually to like although we get fantastic monsters and robots for the kiddies forbidden planet is a cerebral movie slow paced and talky it is working on many levels at once hard sci fi against space adventure philosophical against domestic br br there are many suburban touches in spite of all their space talk the soldiers are dressed for the golf course morbius' fatal discovery is a humble educational facility a schoolhouse the most interesting character is morbius' daughter altaira having never seen a man she is unashamedly forward to the crew she's a post madonna teen who designs her own space age clothes and takes every opportunity to change outfits imagine christina aguilera with a household replicator men watching the film might see her as a naive girl in a minidress but every woman knows there is no such thing as a naive girl in a minidress anne francis deserves better recognition for humiliating the leut with kisses alas we'll never know if she was working him as he suspects since the captain interrupts and becomes a more interesting target for her attention she is the character who makes the important change in the film shocked that her father compares the dead doc to the other embeciles in his landing party she turns away from her father her home to leave with the sailors for earth it's this act of defiance of maturity that sends morbius' id creature over the edge allegorically destroying its creator just as it did thousands of centuries earlier to the krell br br maybe the krell had teenage daughters too
<START> the setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of dickens' classic tale george c scott is very believable as is the rest of the cast his scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie then his character changes to one who is truly repentant the 19th century english town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film it is a movie i watch every christmas along with the real grinch and it's a wonderful life
<START> i work at a movie store and as such i am always on the look out for an excellent movie i decided to check out nothing as it sat in our canadian section and i've been trying to support my country's movie industry i was in for a surprise the film features david hewlett and andrew miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships without working that hard it is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters as well as some funny exchanges we can't be dead we have cable what more can i say without noting that it is worth a shot even if you abandon it within the first half an hour
<START> i've seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot but i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now and i wan tell it's one the best movies i've ever seen in my life br br what you need to know is that you don't have to miss any minute of this movie if you don't completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end br br the end is what makes this movie so good you can't expect it br br congratulations to the producer
<START> if you can imagine mickey mouse as a new york street pimp or john wayne as a communist spy then you might believe pat boone as a juvenile delinquent on his uncle's farm in kentucky and you could conceivably enjoy this movie br br this film is so stupid that it isn't even campy for a mid 1950s sexless love story and the problem is that hollywood made such a big deal about pat boone's refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won't kiss shirley jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the screen consummation of their love it's sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys don't have guns br br the story is pointless even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasm br br april love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with ishtar and plan 9 from outer space
<START> woody allen when at his best has one of the sharpest pens around he can make an acute observation and wrap it around a punch line like nobody else however when he's at his worst his movies can stench of pretentiousness unfortunately melinda and melinda has this stench from opening to closing the set up is one of his more intriguing ideas in a while four friends sit in a restaurant discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama to help settle the argument one man relates the beginning of a story and asks the two other men arguing one a comic playwright the other a dramatic playwright whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy the two men then continue the story and the movie plays out the stories that they weave now when i first heard about this film my understanding was that they tell the exact same story the genre comedy or drama only changes by how you look at it now that would have been interesting however the stories only share one main element and a few side elements they are entirely different stories with major plot differences the drama is so stiffly scripted and pretentious that it can only really work as self parody if this was the point then it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters the comedy is the story that has moments of success but they are still short and fleeting will farrell is obviously meant to be the stand in for woody but he could have played this character so much more believably without adding woody's stutters and hand ticks woody is the best at being woody when someone else tries they're not playing a character they are modeling a recognizable actor this type of thing only pulls the audience out of the story br br my favorite woody allen movies make me leave the theater a little bit lighter in spirit than i walked in this one made me wish i could get my money back
