<START> this is one of the most amazing stories i have ever seen br br if this film had been directed by larry clark then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first place br br instead the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting and how it effected the victims who survived br br i had seen busy phillips in other films before but her performance in this movie is by far her best the only other movie that i've seen with erika christensen is swim fan which made me almost not want to watch this film but she turned in a very good performance herself br br this is one of the few movies i have seen that was actually able to make me cry trust me when i tell you that doesn't happen very often br br home room is a beautiful film and that's all there is too it
<START> how many minutes does it take to paint a poem in this film much too long br br it tells the story about the impact of a first love between two schoolboys br br the boys can't withhold touching each other and making love after a while one gets distracted by a brief encounter with a sensual guy in the disco and that raises doubt exploration fantasy longing lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes that are all extensively painted with music close ups and silent scenes like telling a poem but it really takes too long annoying long shame the effort was promising
<START> probably the two main significances of elmer's pet rabbit are that the wacky leporid featured in a wild hare now has a name and that he utters his famous of course you realize this means war for the first time mostly the termite terrace crowd was still trying to figure out what exactly to do with this long eared rascal it's certainly a must see for hard core fans of this genre but others will probably have little reason to take interest br br but make no mistake it's quite hilarious what bugs bunny does to the eternally gullible elmer fudd clear shades of things to come abound throughout the cartoon i recommend it
<START> this supernatural peter weir thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen richard chamberlain does his best performance here as the australian lawyer who defends a group of young aborigins accused of murder as he gets closer on the case he discovers more about the main defendant chris and not least about himself chris tells him that he is a mulkurul which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in australia thousands of years ago at the same time extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the last wave the one that will drown the world br br the dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience olivia hamnett and david gulpilil are solid in the supporting roles as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays charlie the old aborigin who can turn into an owl the climax and the ending don't disappoint in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so however this can not be called a pure thriller it is a drama as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world a masterful work by peter weir the master of visually stunning dramas
<START> this was the second entry in the regular columbo series and it holds up well today as i am able to look at it closely now on dvd and see how it is constructed i am very impressed with the direction of bernard l kowalski who directed the fine macho callahan as well as countless tv episodes watch how the post murder actions of the killer are shown on a split screen effect on his two eyeglasses watch how the murder itself is shown in montage fashion watch the point of view shot from the perspective of the corpse also the wild but impressive avant garde musical score from noted jazzman gil melle was incredible and helped so much to create atmosphere and the supporting performance of brett halsey as the golf pro was wonderful such subtlety and complexity in a role that nine out of ten times would be a one dimensional cutout the formula had not yet been set when this episode was filmed so there are still some surprises in columbo's methods of course falk robert culp and ray milland are the highest quality actors and it's a pleasure to see them work all men are familiar from many other roles yet lose themselves in their characters here in all this entry in the columbo series and many of the others are as well crafted as a very good feature film
<START> as many people know mexican cinema was very poor after the so called golden age of the mexican cinema fortunately during the late 90's and early 21st century great movies like la ley de herodes bajo california amores perros y tu mamÃ¡ tambiÃ©n and of course el coronel no tiene quien le escriba appeared el coronel is a wonderful movie that retells the classic story by gabriel garcÃ­a mÃ¡rquez by eliminating the magic realism elements and replacing them with the crude reality lived in mexico not only by people like the colonel who wait for their pensions but by more than the half of the mexican population who live in complete poverty the film's characters satirically represent classic characters found in mexican society such as the nationalist colonel the cold and even ambitious priest the hypocrite but at the same time loyal compadre the tolerant and patient wife the hidden homosexual etc this movie is a must see if you want to know more about mexican society and specially if you want to watch a gorgeous movie by one of mexico's finest directors
<START> ulysses as a film should in no way be compared with the novel for they are two entirely different entities however that being said the film still manages to maintain many of the elements that made the book work but since it is a visual medium it is more difficult to pull of stream of consciousness i think this is the best film they could have made with the material and this is from someone that routinely rants about films not being like their literary counterparts i recommend the book but the movie is still entertaining
<START> ugh another one of those fooled by the cover dvds i expected some kind of action at least with bears cats such on the cover i got nothing bad movie br br i forced myself to watch this all the way through thinking that eventually something would happen no luck br br now the reason i gave this a 2 is because of the scenery otherwise it sucked br br the kid was terrible talking to himself although i suppose they couldn't just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all doing his lame karate stances to a tree stump threatening a raccoon munching on worms and what a dumbass kicking a porcupine and he wouldn't be pulling those quills out that easily either they stick like fishhooks at least he fought the bear weakly a couple of times br br what was up with the flashback thing it made a bad movie even worse i wanted to see a survival movie not some dramatic bs about a kid suffering thru divorce br br what else can i say well maybe they should have had the bear eat the kid or something at least that would have been more exciting br br people don't waste your time on this one
<START> the way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the x files continues without mulder and scully these would be a pretty good replacement duo
<START> i would reccomend this film to everyone not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue but to all film buffs because it's sincere moving funny and true because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care because his characters are loved and ask to be loved because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one done by an outsider is a real joy to watch and to listen at because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza who was like freccia beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that ligabue shows as it is unglamorous and ugly without indulging in easy moralisms because it's a film that speaks to our heart our ears our souls and because i lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that thanks luciano
<START> daniella has some issues brewing under her attractive exterior she starts to lose her mind when she finds out about a distant relative who she resembles that was burned for being a werewolf she goes a bit feral when she beads horny men and slashes out their throats she does eventually find a man that helps contain her inner beast but when others ruin their bliss she extracts her violent and furry revenge br br 'werewolf woman' isn't a very goof film but it does pose as a good crowd film a fun time could be had by harping the bad acting dubbing translation and the just plain cheesiness of the production but on it's own it moves slowly but does have ample nudity to keep you awakeÂbarely
<START> with a tendency to repeat himself wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with 'paris texas' br br 'land of plenty' is no exception taking into the fact that i anticipated an average mediocre film even before i went in wenders' ambitions seem to always get the better of him it's taken for grated now his films are heavy handed and bombastic br br i weren't sure if i was watching a comedy that mocks middle america or some thriller the outcome of diehl's character is wholly predicable wender's insistence on layering many many scenes with some rock song is also intensely annoying he was covering up the holes in his script and direction by jazzing up the scenes br br i am certain that many people will find this film important and resonant but in all honestly this clumsy and didactic effort only speaks of poor direction br br interesting that wenders professed that while making 'paris texas' he had great help from sam sheppard with the script yes that was wenders' best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter his films from the past 15 years were a total mess
<START> watching this film for the action is rather a waste of time because the figureheads on the ships act better than the humans it's a mercy that anthony quinn couldn't persuade anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkey br br but it is filled with amusement value since yul brynner has hair lorne greene displays an unconvincing french accent and the rest of the big names strut about in comic book fashion
<START> if you want to see a movie about two utterly unsympathetic characters this is the one the acting is superb both from john cassavetes as the insane paranoid whom as the saying goes they really are out to get and from peter falk as his lifelong best friend to whom he turns for rescue big mistake but since they're both amoral mobsters and misogynistic bastards to boot it's hard to decide whom to root for less only writer director elaine may could have gotten away with this one i thought it interesting that in a lengthy interview with producer michael hausman included on the dvd he disclosed that the two stars had very different ideas about the script that the director was nearly impossible to work with that the director of photography had impossible demands made of him that the crew was constantly angry about being made to sit around waiting and so on this mood of one big very dysfunctional family comes across clearly on the screen
<START> sports movies have never been my thing but a small handful of them work for me the best are the those which focus less on the sport and more on the character such as raging bull the wrestler and girlfight this is a great directorial debut for karyn kusama and an outstanding first performance for michelle rodriguez girlfight feels is both realistic and involving that is enough so to make it a memorable film br br the plot is strait forward enough diana guzman is in her fourth year of high school but due to her picking fights in the hallway she is close to expulsion as a possible means of unleashing her anger she signs up for boxing lessons at the club where her brother is training at the wishes of there father br br in the course of ninety minutes we the viewers see something extraordinary diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman we see it in her body as well as her behaviour especially when one of the boys at the club finds himself drawn to her and she gets into it there is not a bad scene or a lame contrived moment in the film the only error that i would say could be corrected is that one of the subplots ends on what feels like an unfinished note aside from that girlfight is a great movie
<START> the only word that sums up this movie is quirky it's a light hearted romp through an existential concept bouncy in more way than one and a bit nutty i wouldn't exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema and it doesn't seem quite as memorable as the director's first movie cube but it's a good pit of fluff to watch on a sunday morning the acting veers from respectable to annoying at times but i believe that's how it was to be written done as a serious movie it could perhaps have been great or may very well have stepped into a state of pretension a little like the matrix meets head meets human nature br br 6 8 out of ten
<START> loved part one the impossible planet but whoops what a disappointment part two 'the satan pit' is the cliffhanger of something apparently rising out of the pit was nothing coming out of the pit then ages spent crawling round air vents to pad out the story the beast a roaring thing empty of intelligence so no doctor villain confrontation i'd been anticipating the tardis is somehow inside the pit despite the pit not being open till long after the tardis fell through the planet crust and finally another ready made solution which existed for no logical reason i mean why not plunge the beast into the hole as soon as the pit opened why not plunge him in all those years ago instead of imprisoning him anyway why not i could go on but i've lost interest
<START> the good earth is perhaps the most boring film i've seen in my life the plot is slow and lacking the acting is borderline comical while i love paul muni i can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice the only saving grace i found with this film is it's production value the use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment also the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time other than the production value i can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film
<START> a movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself blue juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and cornwall sean pertwee is the real star of this film while the more famous catherine zeta jones plays his girlfriend and ewan mcgregor plays his drug addicted pal br br for those who don't like surfing or cornwall in the slightest you'll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting the beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional the plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they're put in br br only ewan sean and catherine's characters make this a film worth being on videotape which is why it was only released on videotape in the us after ewan and catherine reached mainstream fame
<START> when i started watching the show i said oh no it's as corny as elfen lied and not even that bloody and indeed the setup is almost identical with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him br br but this is where the resemblance stops the love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in inuiyasha while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few the magical setup is a bit corny because it's about seven people with seven servants fighting for the holy grail all servants being someone famous half of all masters being from the same school rules of engagement etc however this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script br br i actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and without comparing it with animes that i liked more but were from other genres i have to say that i was very pleased
