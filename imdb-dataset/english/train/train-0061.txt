<START> this review may contain some spoilers br br the remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie gone in 60 seconds begins well actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well but even a big hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot was more believable for those who don't know the original plot had the thieves working as insurance inspectors who would suspect them but even with a change to nearly every aspect of h b halicki's original the remake is a very good movie until we get to the final chase scene the part of the 74 version that made it great the one in this version is watered down only 10 minutes and it culminates in a monster special effect that takes all believability out of the chase where the original chase was very believable the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunt the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes my advice if you want to watch a classic car chase film fine the original in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake
<START> this film is an interesting take on the killer scarecrow genre amazingly it manages to rise to become greater than the sum of its parts average montage scenes 30 somethings playing teenagers and some excellent facial expressions combine to become one of the new wave of modern classics as a viewer i came away from the film with the same sense of shock and awe as when i first saw the godfather in 1969 tiffany gardner's startling portrayal of the morally bankrupt judy was deserving of her grammy nomination which was well documentedly stolen by ricky martin and restless hips unfortunately the none of the sequels could live up to the expectation of the original unlike the godfather series which got better with each installment and should culminate in 2012 with godfather 4 eat my rage
<START> too bad neither the animals or eddie murphy had anything to say worth saying this movie is just bland br br children's movie well if you're trying to get them to take a nap then maybe it's just 90 minutes of some eye wrenchingly poor animal lip animation to quips that aren't funny and the lip sync'ing makes the old godzilla films look brilliantly done by comparison meanwhile eddie pluto nash murphy drones on with a suppressed understated delivery that is painful to experience apparently he's trying to modify his old manic persona but to what in short all the magic and wonder of the 1967 original version is lost in this re imagining or whatever it is a town wants to bully some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad stuff no really and pluto nash can psycho babble with them things chain along with some stale jokes to a dull uninspired conclusion with no surprises br br rent the '67 movie or some old yogi bear cartoons
<START> this seems like two films one a dreary pretentious lengthy saga about an ac tor who is taken over by the parts he plays the other a brilliant social comment about a middle aged divorce who is picked up by a waitress shelley winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side she drops heavy hints about the need for connections her certificate in massage and her desire to get into the modelling game i love the glimpse of her seedy flat with a kitchenette behind a curtain and her terrible seducing outfit of navel revealing puff sleeved crochet top br br do actors get oscars for shakespeare we know they oscars for impersonating disabled people wearing a lot of prosthetics or pretending to be mad the shakespearean scenes which go on and on are embarrassing and dated and so are the 'going mad' scenes where tony looks distracted while listening to his own voice over br br by the way anthony john is not aristocratic he makes it quite clear in an early scene that he used to be a chorus boy when he quotes his father's advice he slips into a cockney accent
<START> yes be my love was mario lanza's skyrocket to fame and still is popular today his voice was strong and steady so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso having read the book by kostelanitz who wrote a biography of lanza he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary caruso to lanza there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story but the story is not entirely true blame it on hollywood i used to practise singing his songs years ago and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of emphysema asthma ten years ago reaching the high note of be my love is not easy but beautiful
<START> impactful film of four city slickers in crisis in appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity each of four businessmen face their darkest fears when they tackle a challenging whitewater trip on a river about to be replaced by a dam when locals along the way decide to have their way with the interlopers it leads to several deaths and loads of trauma for the survivors each of the travelers is outstanding although voight gives the lead and strongest performance the rural scenery and culture is well captured including the breathtaking dueling banjos sequence i saw this on a date when it came out not exactly the perfect date movie although we both enjoyed it i sort of remember this as a break out dramatic performance for burt voight was already established not the sort of movie you could watch every week but it has a strong punch and is beautifully filmed
<START> recap the morning after his bachelor party paul is woken by his mother in law to be and discovers that there is a woman sleeping beside him unfortunately its a waitress from the bar and not his fiancÃ©e and suddenly she turns up everywhere the toll booth at the freeway and at his parent in laws dinner and it is hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex boyfriend had him followed and photographed it is not only about saving his wedding it is about survival br br comments actually much better than expected not the sweet romantic comedy i expected but something much funnier something with a little edge this movie wasn't afraid to take the jokes a little further and jason lee does now how to deliver comedy especially when his character is half panicked and deep in trouble as he is here and he got nice support from beautiful ladies julia stiles and selma blair and actually i thought lochlyn munro did a nice part as the ex br br so more emphasis on comedy than romance and the end result was good i enjoyed it very much br br 7 10
<START> laugh clown laugh released in 1928 stars the legendary lon chaney as a circus clown named tito tito has raised a foundling a young and beautiful loretta young to adulthood and names her simonetta tito has raised the girl in the circus life and she has become an accomplished ballerina while chaney gives his usual great performance i could not get past the fact that tito now well into middle age has the hots for the young simonetta although he is not her biological father he has raised her like a daughter that kind of ick factor permeates throughout the film tito competes for simonetta's affections with a young and handsome 'count' luigi nils asther simonetta clearly falls for the young man but feels guilt about abandoning tito out of loyalty not romantic love the whole premise of the film is ridiculous and i find it amazing that no one in the film tells tito what a stupid old fool he is being until he reveals it himself at the end the film is noteworthy only because of loretta young who would go on to have a great career while i adore chaney's brilliance as an actor this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy
<START> i'm a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show and i really enjoyed this flick i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters br br it's funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like lame plot and it's much cruder than the show does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot br br and as far as the plot goes it was the perfect dukes plot in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen br br while sean william scott and johnny knoxville aren't exactly like their small screen versions they do a great job and work very well together i wasn't too keen on burt's boss hogg though and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe in the movie roscoe is a little scary br br and who didn't have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard br br folks allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia bikinis and car chases you won't be sorry it's just a great dumb movie
<START> i had the misfortune to watch this rubbish on sky cinema max in a cold winter night i am not a big fan of horror movies because most of them are just trash this one is even worse it is one of the dumbest pieces of crap i've ever seen in my whole life horror movie yes there are horrible things in this the acting the script and the special effects gosh i laughed at this ludicrous attempt to make a flick for 90 minutes actually had it been a comic movie i would've given it a 5 don't you even think about renting this unless you want to mock at the producers br br vote 2 out of 10 didn't vote one because it made me laugh all the time
<START> once again i took a chance and rented this bag of crap billed as a horror flick there wasn't one scene not one that was even remotely scarey not one sure there was some nudity but all the lesbian action got a little old i guess maybe that was suppose to be this movie's saving grace and dan what an annoying ass bag right from the beginning i knew i was in for it when good ol' dan first spoke and he was suppose to be intimidating what a laugh all in all this movie is dreadfully awful how in the hell do movies like this get made if you want a movie with a few thrills in it don't rent this one this movie is about as thrilling as the teletubbies
<START> i found this film to be an interesting study in cause and effect but little more than that the basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions deliberate and otherwise effect the lives of the others the film's premise holds great promise but i feel it fails to deliver on its promise too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it as a result i never got a true feel for any of the characters and never made a good connection with them emotionally by the end of the movie i had a so what attitude about all of them a stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great but as it stands it is merely so so
<START> what's this a canadian produced zombie flick that i have never heard of before a mortician works on the body of a recently deceased young man this allows for an extended flashback that show how the guy got there basically he and friends went to a cemetery on friday the 13th and raised the dead thanks to his silly chanting cut back to the morgue where our dead body comes back to life and kills the mortician and owner who gets his eyes popped out the final wtf shot has the funeral home owner in a straight jacket and screaming i'm not crazy amazingly he has his eyeballs back br br running a scant 58 minutes this is certainly one oddity in zombie cinema it feels a lot longer but put me in some kind of trance where i couldn't stop watching the film also has one of those if you see this image turn away from the screen gags it is the image of an old man getting sick in a theater prophetic and when he pops up only twice the blood begins to flow the scenes are pretty damn gory for the time period there is a great gaffe where a zombie chops off a girl's right hand with a shovel but when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to chomp on it is a left hand
<START> this movie contains no humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness so many scenes reminded me too graphically of my own life experiences this movie was the man's version of mommy dearest it depicts both graphically and accurately the life many children of a mentally ill parent goes through it also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like they are god br br someone told me it was funny no way i say it is sick humor at best br br the movie is so intense and depressing that my son and i had to leave the room the best use for this movie is for people who don't understand mental illness or don't believe what we families actually do live through
<START> this is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless because stupid producers pay their money to make awful films like this instead of donating if they can bother br br this film is even worse than white chicks little man has a lame excuse for posing a character midget as a baby story is awful considering it was written by six people the idea still wouldn't be too bad though if it was original and not a rip off of a cartoon episode it has funny moments but some of them are way over done and some are just stupid the acting was very very bad so was the directing anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves it is racist and very offensive to midgets i mean instead of showing sympathy to them the film makers make fun of them it really disgusts me how they do it they see midgets being just like babies and for a character who is a midget pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family that is its lame excuse for showing something like that it just was not worth it don't watch this film it is a huge waste of time and money
<START> whoa in the twin cities we have a station that shows a big bad movie monday through friday tonight's nugget was a film with carrie fisher called she's back about a really annoying woman who ends up getting murdered when thugs break into her house bea beatrice comes back to haunt her husband she wants him to seek revenge on her killers hence she's back and she won't let him rest until he does so she irritates him endlessly and the viewers too this movie is truly one of the worst movies i've ever seen hey i like bad movies though my fave movie is xanadu i was really shaking my head throughout the whole film wondering who thought this would be a good idea for a movie bea is just so annoying the plot is silly the acting is bad the story well you get my drift anyway if you wanna see a really bad movie really really bad movie check this one out you won't be disappointed heh
<START> but i doubt many were running to see this movie or some came running out of the cinema okay that's a bit harsh br br the film starts in an unintentionally comical way frankie boy comes back to his hometown after many years this already smells of clichÃ©s and the whole town is shaken by his arrival he is talked about everyone wants to talk to him and every woman he meets flirts with him like there's no tomorrow even his niece hints that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with frankie boy a little longer even his pretty niece wants a piece of him sounds like one of those laughable mike hammer episodes where every single female wants stacey keach and like stacey keach frankie boy is anything but a good looking woman's wet dream in real life someone like sinatra without the fame wouldn't get within 100 m of someone as beautiful as maclaine but in this hollywood movie it's the other way around maclaine is absolutely nuts about frankie boy but he couldn't care less sinatra plays his cool shtick much too often in his movies and it is rarely credible dean martin is kind of miscast he isn't miscast as a card player but rather because of the accent which simply doesn't suit him maclaine is charming as ever but she plays a caricature and this reliance on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film the main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seen it all before movies and cheap novels frankie is the cool cat who comes back to town to get all the women and he couldn't care less about his writing which predictably eventually garners recognition martin is a sleazy but friendly card player maclaine is the dumb but very likable bimbo frankie's blond love interest is a snotty literary expert frankie's brother is the successful guy who married into his wife's business and has a lousy marriage and so on clichÃ©s br br the story contains a couple of coincidences which are a little too far fetched for my taste frankie just happens to bump into his niece in a locale his niece just happens to be meters away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the first time and then there is the awful stupid ending br br in it a drunk guy bent on killing frankie boy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all places the place is utterly crowded with the typical noise and chaos plus it's happening in the evening and yet the guy somehow finds frankie in spite of being drunk as a doorknob and shoots at him but guess who he kills maclaine she jumps in front of the bullet to save frankie a clichÃ© which comic book writers might cringe at this utterly pathetic over dramatic and annoying ending certainly cannot please any even semi intelligent viewer and this happens on the same day that maclaine and sinatra got married the writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life how else is the writing of this movie to be explained there is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with frankie martin vs some clichÃ© caricatures out of the writer's vivid imagination it was like a damn western suddenly another dumb thing is the way sinatra was crazy about the boring snotty nosed bimbo and pretty much ignored maclaine as the movie progresses we find out that sinatra finds maclaine to be too dumb for him just as the blond bimbo finds sinatra to be too low class for her there is a certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding maclaine maclaine is treated as worthless by everyone while the blond bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellectual the ironic truth is that the latter's character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual her behaviour comments and opinions are mostly clichÃ©d silly confused pretentious and primitive at least maclaine's character knows that she maclaine is dumb there is another irony that i didn't fail to notice sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story much like the writer of this movie and that's why he came up with the corny crappy finale br br the film basically has a solid cast and the photography is nice but the script though sometimes okay relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on reality based characters and events br br if you're interested in reading my biographies of shirley maclaine and other hollywood intellectuals contact me by e mail
<START> this is one of the best films we watched in my high school spanish class if you are a fan of the opera this film will strongly entertain you of course the dancing is wonderful watching these amazing dancers moving to the music of bizet is well worth checking out
<START> i couldn't believe i spent 14 00 on this the only redeeming quality is the outrageous gore the dubbing was worse than any i have ever experienced it looks like it was shot with a vhs camcorder i think every pfennig was spent on the special effects because there was a whole lot of blood and body parts everywhere its one of the worst movies i have ever seen but i do have to acknowledge the plentiful gore that wasn't as disgusting as it could have been because the whole movie is so silly and unbelievable
<START> i think i will make a movie next weekend oh wait i'm working oh i'm sure i can fit it in it looks like whoever made this film fit it in i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked it looks like someones home movie and i don't think more than 100 was spent making it total crap who let's this stuff be released
