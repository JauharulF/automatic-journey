<START> this series could very well be the best britcom ever and that is saying a great deal considering the competitors fawlty towers good neighbours to name just two br br what made butterflies so superior even to the best of the best is that it did not just exemplify great classic classy and intelligent comedy but it also expanded horizons reflecting flawlessly gently and at every detail the great social change that was occurring in britain at the time br br i remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself this was the first time i saw real people using cordless phones and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in north america at the time then there were the decors shop fronts cars these people even the layabout sons with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor were sophisticated they were examples of the new europeans that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade 1980s br br of course the premise was strange and fantastic the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie montenegro and if the premise was not surprising enough the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme a potential affair that was not really about sex or even romance butterflies dazzled many but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief at the time anyway br br butterflies turned out to be in so many ways prophetic it documented ahead of its time post modern ennui all pervasive lifestyle the notion of emotional infidelity and generational disconnect and male discontent portrayed perfectly by the strained father son relationships it is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come

<START> yesterday my spanish catalan wife and myself saw this emotional lesson in history spain is going into the direction of political confrontation again that is why this masterpiece should be shown in all spanish high schools it is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism the american pilot who gets involved in the spanish civil war chooses for the democratically elected republican government the criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that uribe ever made the colors are magnificent the cruelty of a war could anybody tell me the difference between any war and a civil war is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other the cowards that start their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again a film like 'el viaje de carol' 'carol's journey' tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th century it is a better lesson in history than any book could contain again great work from the peninsula iberica
<START> in iran women are not admitted to soccer games officially it's because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience but of course it is about sexism women are lower forms of human beings br br some brave girls oppose this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks they are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage until the police will come and pick them up br br despite the insane situation this is a film with lots of humor it's also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression you'll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs good job by director jafar panahi this is in many ways a heroic comedy
<START> i've seen this film criticized with the statement if you can get past the moralizing that misses the point moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder as it were this is a decent film with a standard murder mystery but with a distinct twist that surfaces midway through the resolution leaves the viewer wondering what would i have done in this position and i have to believe that's exactly what the filmmaker intended to that end and to the end of entertaining the audience the film succeeds i also like the way that the violence is never on stage but just off camera we know what has just happened it's just not served up in front of us then rubbed in our faces as it would be today with contemporary blood and gore dressing besides the violence is not the point the point is the protagonist's moral dilemma which is cleverly albeit disturbingly resolved
<START> this is a film for entertainment i did not think the world made social commentary from one small film i personally find this film funny audacious and memorable it is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a princess this film was done very well i might add in the 70's a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a person's sexuality this movie is not about a person being homosexual or not it is however about love in all it's strange forms this film does show some of the realities of being gay in the 70's in hollywood or in california pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community br br then the fantasy begins let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have well this movie which in any way was better than that dismal redo the next big thing perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better br br i enjoyed this movie when i saw it in the 70's and it still brings a smile to my lips now i heartily advise anyone who wants a funny tender movie to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun some people need to lighten up and this is the film you should do it with br br
<START> simply one of the best ever richard brooks' adaptation of truman capote's non fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement stunning black and white cinematography that should have won an oscar a haunting quincy jones score and tremendous performances by robert blake and scott wilson as the oddly matched killers this film was 0 for 4 at the academy awards and wasn't even nominated for best picture while dr doolittle was go figure br br although you don't get to know the clutter family as well as you do in the book it was a good decision to focus more on perry and dick and the pain staking process of tracking these guys down john forsythe is also impressive as alvin dewey there are simply no flaws in this one 10 out of 10 best performance scott wilson with r blake a close second highly recommended
<START> i have never watched a movie in so little time the only salvation was the fast forward function on the dvd unit it was like watching a poorly produced cbc film there was obviously no money for lighting filming sets location scriptwriters editors actors oh there was absolutely no story either i need to write ten lines of comment bad awful horrible wretched anguishing tortuous bilious nauseous sickening fromage disgusting flimsy icky yucky pukey stinky smelly vile putrid all thumbs down and i don't know if i can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crap o matic production was
<START> this film so not funny such a waste of great stars who seem to be caught up so in their own stardom that they forget only shining moments belong to john cleese as the hotel manager who likes to dress up you almost fall out of your chair with helpless laughter when he dances to donna summer's bad girls while wearing high heels a mink coat and a dainty hat the rest forget it
<START> there is no doubt that during the decade of the 30s the names of boris karloff and bela lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films after being universal's first monster in the seminal classic dracula bela lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent sadly this last factor would also led him to be type casted during the 40s in the same way boris karloff's performance in james whale's frankenstein transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster of course it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen and the movie that united them was 1934's the black cat this formula would be repeated in several films through the decade and director lambert hillyer's mix of horror and science fiction the invisible ray is another of those minor classics they did in those years br br in the invisible ray dr janos rukh boris karloff is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planet's past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of andromeda while showing his invention to his colleagues dr felix benet bela lugosi and sir francis stevens walter kingsford they discover that thousands of years ago a meteor hit in what is now nigeria after this marvelous discovery dr rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to africa looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor this expedition won't be any beneficial for rukh as during the expedition his wife diane frances drake will fall in love with ronald drake frank lawton an expert hunter brought by the stevens to aid them in their expedition however rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip as he'll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor br br written by john colton who previously did the script for werewolf of london the invisible ray had its roots on an original sci fi story by howard higgin and douglas hodges given that this was a movie with karloff and lugosi colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up one element that makes the invisible ray to stand out among other horror films of that era is the way that colton plays with morality through the story that is there aren't exactly heroes and villains in the classic style but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices in many ways the invisible ray is a modern tragedy about obsessions guilt and revenge br br a seasoned director of low budget b movies filmmaker lambert hillyer got the chance to make 3 films for universal pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles thanks to his experience working with limited resources hillyer's films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains and the invisible ray was not an exception while nowhere near the stylish gothic atmosphere of previous universal horror films hillyer's movie effectively captures the essence of colton's script as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci fi finally a word must be said about hillyer's use of special effects for an extremely low budget film they look a lot better than the ones in several a movies of the era br br as usual in a movie with lugosi and karloff the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality as the film's protagonist boris karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes as his colleague dr benet bela luogis is simply a joy to watch stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was as rukh's wife frances drake is extremely effective truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress still two of the movie highlights are the performances of kemble cooper as mother rukh and beulah bondi as lady arabella as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time making unforgettable their supporting roles frank lawton is also good in his role but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast br br if one judges this movie under today's standards it's very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience however that would be a mistake as despite its low budget it is remarkably well done for its time on the top of that considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept it's ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate one final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive dr rukh and the cold dr benet as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors br br while nowhere near the gothic expressionism of the frankenstein movies nor the elegant suspense of the black cat lambert hillyer's the invisible ray is definitely a minor classic amongst universal pictures' catalog of horror films with one of the most interesting screenplays of 30s horror this mixture of suspense horror and science fiction is one severely underrated gem that even now delivers a good dose of entertainment courtesy of two of the most amazing actors the horror genre ever had boris karloff and bela lugosi 8 10
<START> salva and his pal bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives we see them panhandling in a car of the underground where their pitch to get donations is so lame no one gives them anything salva who is a hardened petty criminal doesn't even have any redeeming qualities that is until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next religion and show business prove to be a winning combination something that salva capitalizes on br br he and bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo salva shows he is a natural for the reality show he transforms himself into a christ like figure who is an instant success in the program espe who is a no nonsense woman who is show's producer can't escape from the way salva pays her unusual attention ultimately salva is the victim of his own success in the end br br jordi molla whose first directorial job this movie is had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television spain which was vulnerable to these types of programs has seen its share of the bizarre which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience br br the ensemble cast has some good moments in the film mr molla like any actor who decides to direct his first feature would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera candela pena a good actress is one of the best reasons for watching the movie juan carlos villedo david gimenez cacho franco francescoantonio florinda chico and the rest responded well to the new director
<START> waqt is a perfect example of a chicken soup not exactly for your soul the broth unfortunately has lost its actual taste thanks to all the excess dilution and garnishing that went into its making br br what's surprising and disappointing about waqt is that it comes from a director who stayed away from the usual clichÃ©s of hindi cinema in his first venture but who in his second outing gives in for all the stereotype film formulas while vipul shah had the conviction to show something as implausible as blind men robbing a bank in aankhen he just fails to induce life in the entire packaging of waqt that is based on something as conceivable as a father son relationship adopted from a gujarati play aavjo vhala fari malishu waqt does have a sensible storyline with a social message to back up a mature look on the father son relationship a father's unconditional love towards his son and a son's responsibility towards his family ishwar chand sharawat amitabh bachchan who has established his entire empire on his own from the scratch leads an affluent life with his wife sumitra shefali shah their only son aditya akshay kumar never had the need to strive for anything since he got everything tailor made and spoon fed in life ishwar's pampering has only spoil him all the more br br aditya dreams to turning into a superstar but does nothing to make his dreams come true in the meanwhile he marries his ladylove mitali priyanka chopra ishwar hopes that marriage will make aditya a more responsible man but he is disappointed aditya is still at his blithe best leading a carefree life br br the endurance limit finally collapses when ishwar expels aditya from his house the sudden change in the attitude of his affectionate father towards him and his now expecting wife baffles aditya he has no option left but to strive for the livelihood of his wife and his unborn kid he starts turning into an independent man but the rift in the relationship between him and his father grows br br the story is simplistic while the uncomplicated screenplay has a very elementary approach one can easily identify and relate with the credible characters of both the father and the son if you are not one of the two you at least might have come across individuals like them somewhere in real life br br add to it director vipul shah's easy handling of the screenplay with a family affair like this any other director in his place would have added in tons of melodrama in the proceedings as per the cinematic laws of bollywood family dramas turning the film into a compulsive tearjerker however shah excels in the effortless handling of emotions for most part of the film br br clear cut example of his unpretentious direction is palpable in the pre interval scene where the father expels the son from his house in a rather frivolous manner the purpose of the scene is achieved without blotting a brunt on the audiences' brains ditto for the scene in the second half wherein the now separated father son have a flippant conversation that's what differentiates waqt from a kabhi kushi ghum or an ek rishtaa and in fact places it one level high in terms of treatment br br but after gaining all the distinction points one may wonder where does waqt still fail in the problem lies in the fact that while waqt distinguishes itself from the others in it's league in terms of treatment it gives in to the glitches in the terms of packaging what with the director forcing in song n dance every now and then in the first half there's a johar kinda shaadi song a chopra kinda holi song a father son disco dandia song a dream song and a dream come true song inducing sufficient yawns in the viewer picture this the father has just ousted the son from his house and the son is dreaming of a song in moroccan mountains with his wife out of place out of reason and the audience out of seat br br the film just drags in the first half and the actual story starts only in the second half the director has wasted too much waqt on unnecessary elements the much talked about dog chase sequence isn't bad but is not redeeming either however akshay kumar's taandav dance is simply ridiculous imagine he qualifies for the star hunt in the movie with this unintentionally hilarious histrionic add to it the climax set at the finals of the star hunt where the son bursts out with emotions that's so archetypal also the editing pattern could have been reversed to conceal the father's reason for the change in attitude towards his son br br anu malik's music is fine though unnecessary in the proceedings santosh thundiiayil's camera work is competent enough though not much demanding aatish kapadia has come up with some good dialogs for dramatic moments br br boman irani and rajpal yadav make up or the light moments in the film very efficiently while rajpal yadav has been going overboard with his comic histrionics in many films off lately this time he underplays his character and is completely restrained his deadpan expressions are perfectly complimented with boman's over the top histrionics br br shefali shah is convincing in the mother's role not to be taken as a censure but she is flawless in both playing and 'looking' her character priyanka is gorgeous and performs her part well br br of course the major applause deserves are akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan akshay is especially expressive in the scene where his doting father intentionally berates him to make him aware of his responsibilities though bachchan goes a bit dramatic in a couple of scenes his brilliance strikes throughout the film br br to sum up waqt is like a soup whose ingredients are both tasty and nutritional but the final recipe somehow isn't as much appetizing
<START> i love this movie it is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging congratulations i believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves it is so eerie you feel like you are watching a real life band i would like to see more movies like this i am glad that they did not choose famous hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked and even if billy connolly is quite well known he really got stuck into the role and i could not imagine anybody else playing it congratulations again i really believe this movie deserves the peter sellers comedy award for bill nighy and when you get to the final scene well what can i say
<START> the special effects of this movie are especially for its time laughable and used in such an over emphasized way that you can't deny their terrible existance br br the acting redefines the term terrible overacting at the hands of meg foster and richard joseph paul where julie newman and andrew divoff just redefine bad br br spoilers br br the charm in this movie can be found in two things first is the excellent casting of carel lurch struycken as the mysterious psychic gaunt who can sense where and when people will die and is always there br br the second are original finds the combination sf western is obviously original if terrible but other finds are more original like the gunman zack stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots though his acting falls short here br br overal don't see this movie except if you love that ol' hunk o brutal carel struycken as any self respecting dutchman should
<START> wow could have been such a good movie starts of with brittany daniels tied up im thinking cool we are going to get a flash back but nothing movie starts anew with the kid filming this movie probably would have been better if it wasn't for the acting i mean the acting was mostly horrible although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with i guess they did the best they could still it really ruin the movie for me the twins were the only ones that seem to have some acting skills the movie drags to long for the supposed shocking conclusion all in all i have seen worse low budget movies but considering this was hype with the 8 films to die for i was very disappointed by the way were did some reviewers say there was gore and stuff did i see the same movie well this is 4 out of the eight and so far only one has been any good
<START> this abc straight to tv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a wrinkle in time ms madeleine l'engle brought children and adults alike into a magical fantastical and original world like no author before her this novel the first in her 'time quartet' is a beautiful take on life the universe and time itself yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms l'engle's work of art honestly what were they thinking the effects look cheap and ridiculous the plot is mushy and uneven the dialogue is far fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent worthy director guillermo del toro david yates alfonso cuarÃ³n makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is a masterpiece this adaptation can only be compared to boring fake and cheap motel room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience
<START> when a small hobbit named frodo baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle the wizard gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord should the ring end up back in his hands he will regain his power and destroy middle earth frodo and his loyal friends set out on a a quest to destroy the ring with a band of warriors this is an underrated adaption of the classic novels as it only covers the first half of the story regardless this is an epic and wonderfully animated film br br the animation is superbly done with rotoscope which is tracing over live action footage ralph bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given the film also boasts a grand music score by leonard rosenman that fits every scene there are a few plot holes with the script but that has to be excused considering the original deal was to make the book trilogy into two films much had to crammed in the first one my biggest gripe is some of the character design samwise was a bit too goofy while the other hobbits act completely normal the other characters are actually well written for the screen and the voice actors do a great job i was pleased that legolas is actually a bit more helpful to the plot the rotoscoped orcs are more comical than frightening while the ringwraiths are eerie and nightmarish br br another problem is that the evil wizard saruman is called aruman thanks to the writers overall i think a little more money and better writers would have done this a lot of justice but there is something charming about it ralph bakshi made a valiant effort of making screen adaption of these classic stories the film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by the live action films but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages
<START> before there was crash there was this interesting film called grand canyon released about 14 years sooner than the former film grand canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime to me crash was still a slightly better film but grand canyon was no slouch either br br taking place in los angeles an upper class lawyer named mack kevin kline takes a shortcut through the seedier side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time he calls for a tow truck and has to wait for awhile only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car soon the tow truck driver arrives at the perfect moment and out steps simon danny glover to take the truck away both men are threatened but simon manages to get himself mack and the car out of dire straits it is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with mack helping out simon just as simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier you see simon's sister deborah tina lifford is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking simon up with his secretary's friend jane alfre woodard br br this is the main plot of the film but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above mary louise parker as well as mack's wife mary mcdonnel who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son roberto jeremy sisto in his first movie role has gone to camp for the summer and will likely be moving on with his own life soon the details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes this simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the story br br the director lawrence kasdan whose biggest movie to this date was the big chill has created a splendid movie here the cast is excellent and most of the ideas are well thought out but alas it falls short of greatness because some points that would've made the film even stronger are glossed over the story involving the secretary is one and the second involving simon's nephew is the other these scenes should've been more apart of the entire story and then maybe lawrence kasdan's views of life between the upper and lower classes would've been more on a superior level instead of just very good still grand canyon exceeded expectations and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after there is also a small role for steve martin as davis a producer of violent films who offers his own views on life and has a small part to play in this movie's ideas
<START> after being a big fan of the ten minute t v episodes of 'stella street' i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed br br i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t v episodes and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing as if the actors had said them once and couldn't be bothered to say them again i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again br br spoilers the plot of the film starts with stella street a normal english street in surrey gradually being populated by 'some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years' including michael caine al pacino jack nicholson and the rolling stones all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people there are some nice moments but on the whole the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring end of spoilers br br in the t v episodes all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell including females but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast i think this was a mistake her impersonations weren't funny and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do br br if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street you may find this film entertaining but if you were a fan i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated 4 10
<START> this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes the money pit and are we done yet only points out all the more how the 40's movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since regretfully been lost br br i was 15 when i first saw this and even at that tender age there was much i could laugh at now of course being familiar with adult frustrations i see a whole lot that i missed as a youth br br the three main actors cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas interacted perfectly but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream it's never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions br br all in all this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it
