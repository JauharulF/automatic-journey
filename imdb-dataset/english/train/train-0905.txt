<START> br br ok the film wasn't going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum and it is a modern update on it's a wonderful life but it's just come out as a cheap release on dvd and there are a lot worse ways of blowing 13 you get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming b list celebs however it's an enjoyable way of passing an hour and half just don't think too much in it
<START> 1 this movie was amazing i watched it while i was in the town next to the one where he grew up i went and saw the buildings that the story took place in overall i loved this movie one of jake gyllenhaal's best also my favorite parts were the science fair and all the times with his father they were so sad it seemed homer wanted to follow his dream and his dad didn't seem to care one way or another that tag line is true sometimes one dream is bright enough to light up the sky 2 the way this movie was shot was impeccable it was all so believable that it could have been recorded during the 1950's dress was accurate and they had their slang down too definitely recommend this movie
<START> this is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist and am i glad he did the blend of british humor should i say humour and the reality of a lost middle aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot those plants under the bushes were not going to make it without the tlc they received and it is a truly hilarious yet touching film i laugh every time i conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights maybe it's just my mendocino county blood but the brits definitely got this one right 10 10
<START> warped take on the pinocchio theme and set during the christmas season after the previous entry abandoned ties to christmas has booby trapped toys sent to murder a child yet through this other victims are accidentally harmed in the process perhaps by a toy maker's son screaming mad george was responsible for the killer toys including a larvae which enters a victim's mouth and out his eye another where soldier toys actually shoot real bullets at a babysitter after her boyfriend was practically strangled by a severed hand toy operating from a remote control the little target is a mute child named derek william thorne whose stepdad was murdered by a red ball with extending arms that ensnare his face causing him to land on a fireplace poker mother sarah jane higginson worries about her son's mental state figuring his reluctance towards opening presents or more importantly talking derives from watching her husband's horrific murder derek's real father noah tracy fraim fears for his son't safety and informs reluctantly his ex girlfriend sarah that the local toymaker joe petto mickey rooney once was arrested for setting traps in toys to harm kids due to the loss of an unborn child when his wife was killed in a car crash kind of a retaliation in saying that if he couldn't have a son then others shouldn't either still quite a heavy drinker often seen swigging jack petto seems to have set aside his feelings towards kids but his creepy son pino brian bremer hasn't and derek he harbors angst towards why you'll soon understand br br pretty disappointing special effects and rather goofy premise rooney's name adds an allure to the film gaining it a notoriety but his histrionics can only help so much attractive lead actress higginson slaughterhouse and fraim as the man who re enters her life aren't so bad but the lame plot that develops is hard to take seriously i'm guessing that's the point but rooney has no reason to be in such a film as this he has no room to bring any personality to his toymaker other than rage and desperation quite volatile barely holding himself together as he explodes in anger towards pino when not downing liquor bremer is appropriately weird and robotic as pino longing to have sarah as his mama the practical effects used during the attacks on victims are rather unconvincing screaming mad george's work with savage steve holland was far more effective than what we see in this film the sex everyone talks about isn't as gratuitous as many would have you believe i can't even recall any nudity probably the best of the numerous sequels greenlighted but that's not exactly an endorsement i'm pretty sure written on paper this was an entertaining concept the idea of spoofing pinocchio using horror elements but the result doesn't exactly blow you away
<START> blade runner deckard is a replicant br br city of lost children augmented senses or whatever used and abused and mostly well just giving us far less than what we might dream of and br br dark city br br these really ought to be added br br for a while now i've been waiting for an animated film that might affect me as much as miyazaki's stuff has this one is the 1st br br hmm scratch the animated part of that br br i have an intense love hate relationship with film noir and hey if you don't leave it must be mostly love right but there are so many sci fi and noir themes totally submerged in this film that it's just a wonder to watch br br these people did an incredible job
<START> yet another early film from alfred hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation as with juno and the paycock you can tell that hitchcock had little interest in this movie there is almost no style or craft to it at all the story revolves around fred and emily a young married couple who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted wealthy man who falls in love with her but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband this might seem more believable if fred weren't made out to be a completely insensitive pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman the couple ends up staying together but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene the third act goes in a completely different direction with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an asian fishing boat joan barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband that's about all you can say for this one
<START> another day stuck indoors another film to watch having finally completed my christmas shopping yesterday on a cold and foggy afternoon i had nowhere else to go to escape the land that time forgot or rather i had nothing else to watch br br doug mcclure that bastion of leading man actors leads a handful of allied sailors sunk by a u boat somewhere in the atlantic in 1916 capturing the u boat in a scene that defies logic and reason they eventually find themselves on a strange island apparently untouched by human hands together they explore the land and discover dinosaurs and neanderthals can they escape before becoming a permanent resident of the land that time forgot br br despite being made few years before star wars these films are light years apart in terms of special effects the model shots are little better than anything you would expect to see in an episode of gerry anderson's stingray and the creatures aren't much better either when the t rex i'm assuming that's what it was was killed it fell in the same way that zombies do when you kill them frozen in mid walk and collapsing arms and legs held out like a sleeping cow that's been pushed over granted the sets aren't too bad but the lousy acting and endless explosion noises which all sound the same do their best to ruin credibility and your enjoyment of the picture as a whole characters are neither believable or worthy of your sympathy as they fire their guns at seemingly anything that moves in the end i just didn't care if they got off the island or not and by the time the end came i was more relieved than entertained br br costumes are authentic enough until the cavemen arrive and it is bear skin bikinis and loin cloths all round and although it was fairly obvious from their actions you wouldn't have known that some characters were german from their accents the whole thing just lacked some polish and cohesion leaving the viewer confused in places and nonplussed in others overall this film barely registers a ripple of excitement these days although you can find some small amusement in trying to work out where colin farrell is i spotted his name in the credits and half expected a baby to appear with an irish accent and suspect facial hair oh well nothing particularly great here to see then but just about ok if you're eating your lunch and the weather is preventing further activity
<START> final score 0 out of 10 br br possible scene specific spoilers but who the hell cares br br yes that's right zero and i rarely give 1's even for the lamest of movies i look for things like music cinematography imagination it's humor even a good pace to be as objective about the score as possible looking at it within it's own genera or subgenera but there is absolutely nothing redeeming here i can't remember another time a movie actually sent me pacing up and down the room when it was over the only reason i made it to the end was because i couldn't seem to change the channel i sat there simply aghast watching to see what insultingly stupid bit it would come up with next it was like watching a snake digest a rat br br but let's have some fun and pull this baby apart shall we first of all there is nothing technical about whipped that works the visuals are all sitcom style the cut scenes all just pictures of the street traffic going by at night over and over the music and score not only doesn't contribute anything to the movie it's obnoxious not to mention it doesn't have anything to contribute to anyway the acting is as cardboard as it comes all around and that goes for amanda peet clearly the star that got this train wreck green lighted too these guys supposedly good friends have no more chemistry or sense of purpose then if director peter m cohen had rounded them up at a bus station minutes before shooting br br on the creative side there isn't an original bone in it's body it has no imagination it shows us nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before the whole premise or twist of this movie is based on male bashing and the idea that an empowered women can play men just as they get played anybody that thinks this is somehow a twist or is in any way original has obviously never turned on a tv before twisted shallow women are common male bashing is the norm it's not stealing from anything specifically it's worse it's stealing from clichÃ©s i can't imagine a women making a movie that depicted other women based so much on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt makes me want to go rent in the company of men or better yet there's something about mary this movie wants to be a edgier version of there's something about mary so bad you can see the sweat br br the movie has no insights into women men dating sex or really anything cohen is simply content to regurgitate myths he has been indoctrinated with from other sexist movies on the other end the movie doesn't work as a satire either because even though it is ripe with exaggerations one could view as satirical it doesn't have that grounding in reality that satires need it doesn't even know what it's satirizing then there's the dialogue which is little more then the characters screaming obscenities at each other example character 1 f k you character 2 oh yeah well f k you repeat br br and the bottom line the thing that could excuse all the other discretions there are a lot of movies without plots without good acting with morally repulsive characters and obscenity laced dialogue that have been funny and thus been good whipped ain't funny not for a second it has no comic skills or timing the situations are all completely phony not based in any shred of truth especially enough to wring laughs out of us the characters all broadly drawn so they will seem relatable to the lowest of the lowest common denominator just look at the marquee scene cult classic hair gel scene one of our bumbling anti heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees mena peet 's vibrator for some reason light shines down on it as if he's found the holy grail why cohen thinks men react this way to vibrators i do not know while he rubs it on himself he drops it in the toilet and then attempts to fish it out with his bare hands when oh my mena walks in on him oh my sides br br but strangely enough people actually like this movie of course people also like friends and reality dating shows so i shouldn't be surprised all of this has a common thread however whipped is big evidence to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in america that will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex they will like any show or movie or think they like it just because it is about dating or relationships it's lack of any quality has no baring on these people just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs they are also indoctrinated to blindly lap up anything dating relationship related to sell them cheap empty effortless tv movies and any number of products br br the only consilation will be that when i die because i saw this movie i've got a credit to get 80 minutes of my life back br br
<START> wow the sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances absolutely incredible if this was visconti's debut film i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film the only other one of his i've seen at time of writing is death in venice which was absolutely incredible more dazzling visually than ossessione obsession one of the most beautiful films i've ever seen but its story was not as involving as ossessione if you click on miscellaneous on this page's links there are stills from the movie on those websites they won't really do justice to the experience of the movie such graceful camera movements such beautiful composition such wonderful faces such terrific characters such a great story development the first movie adapted from james m cain's the postman always rings twice br br i can't believe this was made in 43 eight years before brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with streetcar named desire 1951 the actors in this may not have used the method technique ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves i don't know anything about it but they're some of the best most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema also eight years before streetcar named desire brought a new sensuality to the screen ossessione was electrifyingly sensual the most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema yes i'm being superlative but ossessione was just that terrific br br the reason ossessione didn't cause the impact streetcar did was that it was made in fascist italy and banned by mussolini and re cut in america american audiences didn't see its full glory till 59 eight years after streetcar br br i won't say any more about it just writing to tell you its one of the best most beautiful and exciting movies i've ever seen and tell you to go out and see it like another reviewer i'm going to buy it as soon as i can find it
<START> i have to say despite it's reviews angels in the outfield was a pretty good movie i like the fact how it teaches kids to always have faith and never give up because yes miracles can happen unlike the other baseball movies this one particular movie stood out because of hits amazing special effects and well orchestrated soundtrack which was very interesting though i liked this movie it did have some flaws such as some irrelevancy i e towards the end when ray mitchell hits a homer he doesn't step on the plate and therefore that wouldn't be a score but that's just nitpicking i have to say i was really impressed with this movie's presence and moral just have faith don't give up
<START> guys and dolls is a movie itching for a remake it was made forty eight years ago its two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds although a remake with big stars now would be box office success it would not be able to capture the magic that went into this version its boundless energy can't be recaptured nor can the pure joy you get when watching something like this a huge widescreen big entertainment movie br br marlon brando who last clocked in at 409 lbs last time i heard plays sky masterson one of the biggest gamblers in new york frank sinatra is nathan detroit whose as often as he can find a speakeasy for it crap game is city wide famous however when the one place he has left to hold it is charging 1 000 detroit needs the money fast he bets masterson 1 000 that he can't take missionary sarah brown jean simmons to havana with him the next day br br guys and dolls is basically nothing more than unsavory types singing and dancing which usually as it does here add up to fun it's obvious to see how this was a broadway musical there weren't that many sets and the scenes were long if i was to complain about one thing it's how uneven the songs were at times there were two songs in a scene other times thirty minutes went by without one guys and dolls is never boring just a great time br br my rating 8 10 br br not rated
<START> this is the weepy that beaches never was as much as i wanted to love beaches it always seemed too hurried for me to feel for it its soundtrack is one of my favorite albums though stella on the other hand moves at a slower and occasionally too slow pace and though it's somewhat manipulative in its tears inducing tale about a self sacrificial mother it works because bette and the rest of the cast turn in great performances 10 10
<START> i thought this movie would be dumb but i really liked it people i know hate it because spirit was the only horse that talked well so what the songs were good and the horses didn't need to talk to seem human i wouldn't care to own the movie and i would love to see it again 8 10
<START> what can i say this is a piece of brilliant film making that should have won an oscar a copy should be kept safe in a secure vault for posterity it should be required viewing for all high school students across the world sam mraovich is a genius perhaps the most genius writer director producer chef babysitter walmart greeter to ever grace the cinema world with his art br br where do i begin with this one every millisecond of ben and arthur was so completely breathtaking and mraovich as arthur wow he is so attractive i'm surprised he didn't go for mr universe i couldn't contain myself during the nude scene i loaned this movie to my brother and he called me on the phone saying how arthur's nude scene turned him gay i am totally supportive of course because of this film and it's beautifully crafted lessons in tolerance why just yesterday i burned down a church and i wrote for sam and arthur in its smoldering ashes br br the cinematography was the best thing about this film when that fed ex plane took to the skies amid the palm trees of vermont i wept why i never even knew they had palm trees in vermont or that people could travel on fed ex planes before this film it opened my eyes to a new realm of possibilities this film inspired me to enroll in sam mraovich's school of screen writing acting directing composing casting producing production design and real estate i just want to say thank you mr mraovich thank you for bringing this creation into the world we can never re pay you enough
<START> why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether or not they are fencers that point is completely immaterial to any argument to be made against this total dog of a movie br br i think sports movies fall into two categories well made movies about the human spirit and competitions and by the sword' br br honestly this movie never could decide what it wanted to be a touching drama for trying to be your best in life an indictment of competitive motivation or a martial arts flick in the end it didn't do any of those convincingly or completely enough to make me give one ounce of care of any of it br br for the record i also am a fencing instructor and now i am officially as bad as the rest but putting bad fencing in a movie doesn't make it bad automatically i mean look at star wars episodes 4 6 good movies bad fencing i liked those movies but when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason people think that it is only the purists that think it a lame effort br br don't be fooled by any comments on the smaller issue of fencing this is just a bad movie in the end this movie has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or the movie buff or simply anyone with a pulse and three brain cells br br when i see a movie and am forced to think man i wish i was watching the mighty ducks ' i know that it is time to bypass the argument with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is anyone in the lobby that will somehow give me two hours of my life back
<START> the reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did that means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it when i first saw this movie it scared me and made me think about life and religion this is not a blood and gore scary type movie but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written of course non believers will say its only a sci fi movie truth is this movie is a must have for your thriller collection even if it does have a religious view if you are a fan of classic thrillers omen etc this is one of them and its a must have i never saw the sequel distant thunder but i believe it picks up where this movie ends
<START> where to begin the special effects should be named special defects when the director shouted action i guess he also indicated to the actors to carry out the worst performance they could think of maybe he was annoyed with the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not recover a single cent out of their investment and that the work would be a case study of how not to make movie or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an accountant but his family did not let him br br the only thing that is sure that whoever employs him in the future is because its in love with him so its objectivity jumped through the window or because he changed its name and deleted all past previous references
<START> firstly let me say that i didn't like the fact that the rock won the title that is so gay next i feel regal should have got back his european title jeff hardy is a crappy champ rob van dam had the intercontinental title too long already brock should have won it i am pleased with storm and christian being tag champs best match was the booker t and big show match in my opinion
<START> haunted by a secret ben thomas will smith looks for redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he doesn't know once his plan is set nothing will be able to stop him at least that's what he thinks but ben hadn't planned on falling in love with one of these people and she's the one who will end up transforming him will smith is back again with director gabriele muccino after the life inspiring movie the pursuit of happiness seven pounds is yet another life changing movie experience which not only does reminds you of their previous collaboration tearful but inspires you joyfully in the end will smith also is the producer again with some of the others these movies are very realistic which depicts a common man's life his struggles through life seven pounds might have took some time to gain it's actual momentum but just after half an hour of the movie the movie is all set to rule your heart also this movie has some twists revolving around which lets the viewers keep guessing director gabriele muccino once again is the winner all the way with his emotional yet inspiring message he makes all the characters of the movie very real that the people would actually find themselves in somewhere of the movie along with the director will smith is yet another winner with his superb acting skills once again the duo of the director the actor works as a charm also there are other talented actors in the movie who did their part pretty well rosario dawson beauty with brains that's what she can be called she looks beautiful does her part extremely well barry pepper gives a great support to the movie woody harrelson does the same although woody did not had much screen timing would have been good if he had more you won't forget this movie easily watch this movie change your life top class cinema
<START> unfortunately this film 54 was a pathetic attempt of the true story of 'studio 54 ' the only thing that was good about the picture was 'mike myers' who was a joy to watch 'neve cambpell ' although her role was little was unfortunately bad the bottom line is that this film lacked a good performance from the actors except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt for a good screenplay
