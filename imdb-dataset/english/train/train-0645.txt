<START> i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it weren't for ms claudine barretto's performance and i will take this time to overlook that kris aquino's here and end br br i really avoid watching pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that some writers don't give enough attention to the characters and their progression in their stories redundant it was as if they 'pushed' the movie onwards when their storytelling stank and my goodness creative exhaustion led them to rip off other movies why why did this movie get a good review i wouldn't give it that much merit the movie was kind of scary but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with filipino folklore it goes into my list of 'most likely to happen' category i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences never mind if the lighting sucked it wouldn't matter much if the content would blow you away sayang
<START> hail bollywood and men directors br br really this is the ultimate limit in utter sacrifice made by indian woman br br viewing the current state of affairs in india where the wives are becoming more vicious day by day and are very possessive about their husbands the directors also can be called uncle scars refer movie the lion king came up with a very new concept on how both the kept and the wife can live together happily ever after sharing everything between themselves including the spermikins br br story line married couple very happy but accidentally a mishap happens and wife has a miscarriage lost the foetus along with the capacity of ever becoming a mother br br now in in india the in laws usually drive away the daughter in law if she fails to give them an heir so the wife hits upon a major plan surrogate mother but the scientists intervened sure artificial insemination no said the artist director actually neighbourhood will come to know that the daughter in law is barren so they are going for surrogate mother br br neighbours society gosh the same ones who watch fashion tv day and night watching girls between the age group of 14 to 40 al in bras and panties well those neighbors suddenly take an upper hand in family planning and decision making br br so the wife sends away her husband to a beer bar where girls are dancing on the stage all mostly uneducated and illiterate but men love such women as they can satisfy their egos a lot br br he hires the lead dancer in the pub asks her to bear his baby in exchange for money she agrees she comes home becomes pregnant wife and kept both co exist in the same house in the mean time the prostitute also gets a taste of household life so much caring people around she misses them all and cries silently in the mean time no one in the family comes to know that the real daughter in law is roaming around with a pillow beneath her petticoat the mother or other elderly people never took her for check ups nor did they try to feel the baby's movements in the womb
<START> i really did not watch this show as often when i was a child but the first episode i remember ever seeing is the episode where kimmy gibbler pierced stephanie ears when i started high school back in 2000 i had problems all through out high school and i'd rather not get into that but i used to always watch saved by the bell but that show really reminded me of the problems i faced at school and it rarely showed the kids parents saved by the bell is okay but not a good family show a few days after i graduated high school in 2004 i turned the tv to the family channel and day after day i got addicted to full house i could even push the info button and see the year it came out and i would remember what i was doing during that time period the episode was about to come on and it was titled birthday blues and to this day it is most favorite episode it's sad with a happy ending and you see kimmy gibbler in a way she doesn't act in other episodes she actually shows her serious side i have seasons 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 on dvd and i am waiting for 7 and 8 i wished somehow they could have a documentary and some commentaries from the cast members i don't why some people have a hatred for this show because you don't see trash and violence on this show and for those who hate this show i pray for you because you might have grown up in a dysfunctional family where there was no love but full house in my opinion is a family living in heaven where everyone is happy and good things always happen and the characters are so awesome danny tanner reminds me of my mother and grandmother joey is good natured and is always in a good mood when i was a child i used to be just like jesse and he is the first actor on tv as a guy that is so obsessed with hair somehow you can actually tell that dj is a california girl i really like the episodes with kimmy gibbler because she always makes me smile and brightens my day when i watch her and stephanie is so cool also i have a hard time telling the olsen twins apart i want my kids to watch it one day but full house is my 1 favorite show and sabrina the teenage witch is my 2 favorite one day sometime before i die i would really like to meet all the cast of full house in person the first 3 seasons are kinda boring but they start getting better in the 4th season i just wished they could have made a 9th season they stopped making full house in 1995 and in the fall of 1996 sabrina the teenage witch came out which is a similar family show but full house is a very loving show and they have their good times and bad times and yes i understand if your a wild trashy type person your going to hate this show but this is a show for happiness and it is also moral show also i would like to say that the first 3 seasons is good kid shows but around the 4th and 5th seasons dj and stephanie become teenagers also i noticed not only with full house but a lot of shows they never talk about the problems in the world and politics like when full house was on the air during the gulf war in 1991 and during the time of the oklahoma city bombing in 1995 they never mention anything about it also steve was my favorite dj's boyfriend the ones with viper and nelson were'nt very interesting but season 5 and 6 i think are the best i just wished they would have made a 9th season because it left a big question mark in my head because on the last episode in the last minute dj gets a surprise and goes to her prom with her ex boyfriend steve i always wondered if they got back together and i liked how in the final seasons dj was always the responisible one and stephanie was always wanting to do something daring like in the episode stephanie's wild ride
<START> warning i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment br br although i haven't seen them all the hamiltons sure did deliver one lowsy piece of entertainment which it did not entertain me at all i thought that in common with the semi bad acting stupid plot scheme and the twist at the end of the movie which was very retarded this movie sucked okay so supposively these are people who eat other people yeah notice i said people not humans not because they aren't human or wait i think they are oh no wait they didn't tell you so okay are these people cannibals or are they imbreds or what are they i mean maybe they're just things that came here to see what people taste like or are they cannibals who have eaten people for a long time now or maybe this movie was hhoorriibbllee which it was so if you think the hamiltons is good i ask of you why why why why why was it so awesome because to me it was just flat out terrible one big booooooo for the hamiltons go see the gravedancers tooth nail or borderland for a piece of entertainment
<START> this video rocked eddie is one of the funniest comics i have ever seen not only does he have class he makes some of the funniest observations on history and culture that i have ever seen eddie is the most original and most intelligent comic i've seen in a very long time tell all those other stand ups to get off the stage and let this executive reign
<START> i accidently felt on this movie on tv and i wasn't able to leave it it's really an excellent movie which makes people learning about american's history with the vietnam war the flower power's time the racism's fight it illustrates the conflict of generation of political opinion of race which took place in the 60's i'm born in 1980 so i didn't know all that stuff before in france usa's history is not a priority and that movie really learned me a lot of facts by the way i think all the actors are great especially jordana brewster josh hamilton and jerry o'connell now i can see this film more then 1 time each day it's really great what a shame it only appeared on tv not in cinemas br br
<START> my god this movie was awful i can't complain about it too much i went to see it just to be grossed out it did suffice sort of it's funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was in the very very beginning where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby br br i also think that it's funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the hispanic soldier who was a supporting actor in next friday everyone in the movie did a horrible acting job it was some of the worst acting i've ever paid to see br br i also expected that it would be much more gruesome than the first one it wasn't i expected it to be more gruesome because it's a sequel and horror movie sequels are usually much less successful than their predecessors i expected it to be more gruesome since gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days grudge 2 saw 3 jeepers creepers 1 2 dead silence but it actually wasn't nearly as gruesome as the first one which was yet another disappointment br br the mutants in the first one were kind of disturbing but the filmmakers were trying so hard in this one to make them creepy that they were absolutely hilarious br br i also hated the entire concept of showing the clip of the female soldier's son on her camera phone saying i love you mommy four times it was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel even worse for her by showing it three more times for no reason this movie was a joke
<START> for a science scare movie to work well it has to be either truly original or a very good retelling this movie is neither sure there is a pseudo original twist in that the guy kills people because of a toxin and not because of a disease but that is a very minor twist there is the government conspiracy angle the crusader protagonist who has personal experience br br and one real drawback of this movie is that the contaminated man has no pathos although the character is scripted to be someone who should be pitied he is not without the pity the movie is pointless the other characters are so cookie cutter they are ridiculous the subplots are convoluted and annoying and the saddest thing is the movie is too flat to even be enjoyed as mock material make the movie a 45 minute short and it might be worth watching
<START> always enjoy the great acting of drew barrymore and her great performance in this film where she plays a very very complicated young gal holly gooding skipped parts 2000 who leaves new york and travels to california and shares an apartment with a up and coming writer george newbern patrick highsmith far harbor '96 many strange things start to happen to holly and she seeks to find her brother in a mental institution after he killed her father if you look close enough you will actually see the mother of drew barrymore in real life appear as her mother in this picture if it was not for the good acting of drew barrymore and george newbern this film should be seen only on halloween night however it sure has it's surprises in the end
<START> my family and i screened underdog the night before and as bad as underdog is my four year old loved it hot rod makes it look like oscar worthy material the only thing that could have saved this movie was if evel himself had come out of retirement to slap samberg in the face for making this movie i will admit however that the soundtrack was good i wasn't sure if the movie was set in the 80's but with the majority of the music coming from europe who knows if i were you i would take a pass and just stay at home and watch the test pattern on your local tv station or if you are dead set on watching this people under the influence might enjoy it
<START> i liked this movie when the guy who was in on a bank heist of 40 million in gold dies his cell mate is used as bait to lead them to the high tech crazy killer partner by having a monitoring device implanted in his jaw without his knowledge it's an action spy type film with enough comical scenes to keep it light it reminded me of enemy of the state well acted and good enough plot
<START> my friends and i rented this for bad movie night with high hopes but the brain was something of a letdown the brain itself is gloriously goofy looking but it mostly just sits on its little platform who thought that it would be cool that the brain only gets to munch on three people throughout 94 drawn out minutes this movie has a number of things going for it at first including an estevez knockoff lead playing a rebellious genius we're told that his enormous intellect is misdirected into his elaborate pranks and school stunts which include putting krazy glue on someone's chair it also has some great lines a hilariously out of shape and out of breath henchman who just barely manages to be everywhere and yeah some chick gets naked however the director desperately needs some schooling in the art of pacing during the last half things just start to drag on and on with at least 3 or 4 pointless boring chase scenes making up the middle third of the plot the scenes inside the pri complex are especially bad at least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same stairwell i could've fixed the screenplay to this thing in half an hour more cheese more gore more nudity more brain action if you're going to make a bad horror movie at least give me something cool to look at while my superego shuts down maybe the director was trying to really bring the audience into his movie i started feeling like one of the zombified townsfolk by the end of this crapfest
<START> michael jackson would have claimed a spot for the top billed character in the golden child and because he loves kids that didn't work and why should it so instead we have eddie murphy out to save the world by rescuing kid midas i would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor's inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy adventure comedy that's a step closer to ishtar whatever murphy says or does can be best liked but don't get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent he doesn't belong in this movie and the same went for dr dolittle the violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic and that wouldn't have made any sense as hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy speaking of visuals they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of ronald reagan's presidential fame murphy is far better at coming to america and 48 hrs but this stale movie isn't my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste
<START> i can't believe that this movie even made it to video and that video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves i literary asked for a refund take away the fact that the movie has no historical truth it and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store it is not even good enough to be called a b rated movie do not waste your money or your time on this movie just listing to the voice over and the horrible music made me sick anyone involved with this movie should be pulled from the union gives the industry a black mark but after watching most of this movie i really don't think anyone involved is a union member
<START> terry west had a good idea w this movie he just didn't flesh it thru there are endless shots of the creepy looking school's exteriors that go on forever and probably to pad the film's running time also at this school there are only 2 students misty mundae is good as usual but this film will always belong to ruby larocca which is the only reason to watch the film in the beginning if the script centered on her interesting character we'd have a movie to watch she is so gorgeous good news for dvd buyers terry west's earlier and better film blood for the muse is a special feature one thing i'd like to say is that this movie feels like someone who's not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke for the ending feels that very same way then again just watch this for ruby larocca
<START> this is complete and absolute garbage a fine example of what a bad movie is like this can't be appealing to anyone not even b movie fans do not i repeat do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash bad acting bad directing horrible but i mean really horrible script and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment of any form is i bought the dvd for 3 dollars i swear i could almost pay someone to take it burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me i like b movies the killer toys the weird lagoon monsters but this is nowhere near you know those movies that are so bad they are funny not even just plain old pathetic
<START> this is a very interesting project which could have been quite brilliant gathering 11 prominent international directors and allotting each of them 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice each short exploring the global reverberations of 9 11 without using any spoilers i would say that ken loach's piece is the jewel in the crown and mira nair's short segment india based on a true story deserves to be made into a full feature film one also realizes while watching his short why alejandro gonzÃ¡lez iÃ±Ã¡rritu is one of the best directors in the world today Â he simply is a master of the medium who has also a profound understanding of the subject matter unfortunately not all 11 parts are made as well youssef chahine in his segment egypt assumes the arab stance of the self inflicted collective guilt which piece could have potentially been the most interesting one he fails miserably chahine's short is poorly written and badly executed at least enough to stand out amongst other superior chapters of the film despite the imbalance in quality i would still give the film 7 10 for concept if not for execution
<START> this game is very addictive i kept playing it for hours straight until late at night but also the fact that you can't save a game when you are in space contributed to this at times i just had to play on in order not to loose any game data br br so yes freelancer is addictive but also quite flawed also for instance something that extremely bothered me was that you couldn't skip any of the cut scene's with as a result that at times you had to watch the same few minute cut scene time after time a great opportunity for me to multitask to check my e mail or have a chat with my friends and more things like that while i had to wait for the cut scene to be over br br the story starts of promising but the further you get the more ridiculous it all gets also the game also ends quite abrupt at least it did so for me it is quite obvious that they are hinting at a upcoming sequel i don't know if a sequel is in the works at the moment but i am sure that most likely i will pick one up once it will be released br br the gameplay is very easy even for those who are not familiar with flight games to put it boldly every fool can play this game yes some levels are quite hard and require lots of effort it took me about 1 2 weeks for me to finish this game which might be a bit too short but thank god for the multi player option it allows you to keep playing short missions just like the single player game once you have completed it by the way br br even though lot's of mission are the same it just simply stays cool to be in the middle of the at times massive dogfights br br the graphics are good but just not anything revolutionary or anything br br addictive game but beware of its flaws br br 7 10
<START> i think scarecrows are creepy so it's a pity this movie doesn't make more of them br br a bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows one of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows the acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive when they move on the positive side the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows it is as alfred hitchcock says a bomb under a table goes off and that's surprise we know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off and that's suspense
<START> the most misogynistic movie of all time not to mention by '68 shouldn't they have moved beyond white people in brown face playing the indians my favorite parts though have to be when the girls giggle and blush as the bikers drag them off to gang rape them rape is fun who knew let's see then there's the blatant rip offs of the hustler fat boss character actually plays pool while scheming to destroy the indians with the lead rebel dude the horrific acting the so on the nose they might as well have just told you what to think music cues the lack of anyone who's actually indian in this movie and who are we supposed to be rooting for i have to say it figures that quentin tarantino loves this movie even though his movies tend to champion strong women i've heard from at least one source that in real life he's a misogynistic idiot why did i watch it you ask don't ask
