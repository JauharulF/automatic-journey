<START> personally this is one of my favorites of all time no i'm not 10 i'm 30 i own an old original vhs of this that i bought from a rental store i've watched it countless times br br while it's an amusing movie for kids it's an intriguing movie for adults i once saw this movie whiile i was not sober my eyes were opened to things i had never noticed before i saw morals being strongly encouraged both overtly and somewhat subliminally i wish i could remember all the things i noticed in particular but it's been a very long time since then rest assured there are tons of things that are alluded to throughout the movie if you get the chance to view it not sober do so you won't be disappointed as a matter of fact you will probably feel rather happy and warm br br unique and wonderful
<START> nagra comes from conservative indian family that isn't exactly into girls playing competitive soccer but our attractive young star can play some serious soccer rhys meyers coaches nagra and encourages her to perform while knightley is supportive teammate and friend when sis' wedding is scheduled for the same day as the ultimate soccer match what's a girl to do similar in its own unique way to bfgw as nagra tries to push the envelope on traditional family ways here it's dad well played by kher who can see both sides of the issue docked an entire point for a hokey late sexual preference non crisis if they needed filler they could have gone elsewhere nice final wrap up to the whole deal
<START> disney's done it again the company that made mr magoo and george of the jungle has made another movie that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based and keeps none of the spirit of the original br br inspector gadget was one of my favorite cartoons when i was a young one and for a movie of it to exist may have been a dream come true back then now that that movie does exist i was severely disappointed even outraged br br first we have the characters br br gadget himself has the gadgets that made him such a fun character in the original cartoon with well done special effects accompanying them and he even has some of the naivete of the original gadget but he is now more competent and is expected to solve the crime himself while penny and brain just watch br br penny has little to do while she played a major role in the cartoon discovering the crime and halting it and occasionally getting captured by the mad agents now she is simply introduced and then forgotten although she does at least sneak into claw's base br br claw is the movie's version of dr claw who was a rather sinister raspy voiced man who wore metallic gloves and sat in his chair his face hidden from view as he stroked his cat and oversaw various crimes now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand with no mystery behind the character br br brain and mad cat exist in the movie but are rather insignificant to it br br even small parts of the cartoon aren't spared in this butchering the famous expression wowsers was mysteriously changed to wowser and gadget's gadgetmobile now looks different and talks br br there is even product endorsements everywhere why is yahoo advertised on a sign why does the gadgetmobile have buttons for m m's or skittles br br fans of the cartoon will hate it others might will likely find the movie below par and when all is said and done this movie is another attempt to make some quick bucks off another old show
<START> this is a great film br br i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this i had never heard of it or anyone in it excpet mike from friends br br but it is great eva lake and paul give amazing performances the humour is consistently dry and witty br br paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends which works great the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic i mean we are not talking 'apocalypse now' here but the characters are likable the story is engaging the soundtrack production and direction all work well br br in all a great feel good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets br br everyone has their own tastes but i really don't understand the one star reviews for this
<START> maria bello doesn't seem to care what people think of her choices in movie roles again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in maybe she needs those movies to get off the sugar coated aka hollywood ones she does here and then coyote ugly and of course mummy 3 br br while i think fails to achieve what it sets out to do i won't spoil that maria bello is as great as in her other independent small movies she stars in it's her performance that elevates this movie this combined with the strange subject matter almost did the trick for me but in the end and even if i try to overlook some flaws like bad pacing and dramaturgy the movie is still too long
<START> so what's the reason is there some sort of vendetta against this awesome show or somebody involved therein why would the best show i've seen in years be canceled i'm addicted i saw this show on randomly last fall and immediately loved it and watched it every week then it went away and i tried to tivo it but it wasn't being aired so i forgot about it for awhile until i found the episodes on abc's website now i want more i agree with everybody else with the rest of the junk on tv today it was refreshing to see something as well rounded and developed as this i watch boston legal for my eccentric comedic fix and house for my intellectual mystery jackass fix my wife loves grey's anatomy for its realism and i do love hate the show but it could not be farther from real for me way too much drama everything that can go wrong does but for once there's a drama that's really real real people real problems sure there are some extremes like a former gangster turned good girl running from the mob etc but these people especially in nyc are really out there and i relate to each and every one of them i can't seem to get enough i just hope that abc will get their heads out of their bean counting butts and continue this show get some respect for having a quality drama out there this could be one of the best shows of all time if somebody will just let it
<START> if an auteur gives himself 2 credits before the main title and about 15 more credits before the movie starts and the first shot shows the auteur rolling around on a bed in lycra bike shorts it won't be a surprise to observe that said auteur has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex the kind of look that might be useful to a homosexual aversion therapist br br others have given this thing the dishing it deserves for me the most pitiable moment came when the trip from la was signified by a plane landing at what appeared to be lax and the return was signified by a shot of a fedex cargo plane
<START> disappointing musical version of margaret landon's anna and the king of siam itself filmed in 1946 with irene dunne and rex harrison has deborah kerr cast as a widowed schoolteacher and mother who travels from england to siam in 1862 to accept job as tutor to the king's many children and perhaps teach the royal one a thing or two in the process stagy picture begins well but quickly loses energy and focus yul brynner reprising his stage triumph as the king is a commanding presence but is used per the concocted story as a buffoon kerr keeps her cool dignity and fares better despite having to lip synch to marni nixon's vocals perhaps having already played this part to death brynner looks like he had nothing leftover for the screen translation except bombast second half with anna and the moppets staging a musical version of uncle tom's cabin is quite ridiculous and the rodgers and hammerstein songs are mostly lumbering brynner won a best actor oscar but it is feisty kerr who keeps this bauble above water overlong heavy and 'old fashioned' in the worst sense of the term from
<START> the documentary begins with setting the perspective to several light years the voyager is traveling our milky way with the sounds of our earthly lives as a space monument for possible extraterrestrials br br the documentary contains footage of willy dixen robert johnson skip james and j b lenoir the footage of j b has never been published before the narrative is from 'blind willie' dixon however it's done by an actor the film shows the work of all these early blues men followed by covers and interpretations by musicians such as nick cave and the bad seeds among others br br the death of j b lenoir john mayall's song is a striking event in the story lenoir got political engaged and is considered to be of the league of martin luther king and peers his political interests can be found in the themes of his lyrics br br blues is found to be 'the' native music of america blues is the roots and the rest is the fruits br br the title 'soul of a man' is after a willie dixon song
<START> yesterday i watched this movie for the third time it was recommended to me by a fried several weeks ago i never watched or even noticed it before because it falls so typically in the category swedish movie and those who rose up like me with hollywood productions tend to be sceptical of any foreign movies hell what a paradigm shift the film touches me because it just keeps up my hope that mankind can change to a better way the swedish village is just a pattern for all areas on earth where people live together controlled by religion misunderstandings lack of courage predictions disguised brutality but also the ability to have fun to meet to sing it takes a trigger from outside to rip off the masks of everyone who keeps one and to let them feel that we all are just human beings with the desire to live our own lives i can never stop to see stories like this because that keeps up my hope as described above the five minutes containing the story of gabriella's song including her performance is one of my movie highlights ever thank you kay pollak just for these 5 minutes which made me happy
<START> quite one of the worst films i have ever seen terrible acting laughable 'action' it's clear that the cars are travelling slowly atrocious script hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie we know judge reinhold is a fine actor but he should be ashamed of this detritus there is no great tension within the car and when the characters stumble upon moments of hope they laugh like inane banshees for some reason even 'high five ing' when they see the bridge lowered br br also the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car strains credibility apparently based on true events though if that's the case truth is evidently stranger than fiction unfortunate then that it was portrayed in such an inept manner
<START> a sweet and totally charming film shall we dansu made me laugh and cry at first appearance sugiyama san was not terribly appealing an uptight salaryman seemingly devoted to his family but all too easily captivated by a face in a window the object of his obsession is distant and cold but by the end of the movie i was in love with him her his wife and daughter all the dance instructors and dance students this uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a little jewel that i would enjoy seeing again
<START> i want to start by stating i am a republican even though i don't agree with a lot of the things bush has done in office and i love the daily show and colbert report they have to be two of my favorite shows on tv i enjoy the bush jokes on conan letterman leno because i admit that w is not the smartest guy to ever walk the earth i do believe he's not the dumbest either but it comes to a point when enough is enough and it's not really that funny anymore i see where it can be funny and it is hey he's making fun of our authority figure he's hilarious comedy central though is just trying to hard to poke fun at him i mean maybe one special episode but an entire series is just dumb it seems cc is just saying the same bush jokes that we've heard way to many times i really cannot see this show going past 1 season
<START> vic richard dreyfuss is a mob boss leaving a mental institution back to his world of gangsters how can a director have a cast with richard dreyfuss ellen barkin jeff goldblum diane lane very gorgeous gabriel byrne gregory hines kyle maclachlan burt reynolds billy idol and a make such a waste of time this movie is a comedy that is not funny having a constellation in the cast my vote is four br br title brazil ' prazer em matar te ' 'pleasure in killing you ' br br
<START> this is a story about shin ae who moves to milyang from seoul with her young son jun to start over after the accidental death of her husband her husband was born here and she is opening up a piano school but also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from the death if that is what the film was about it probably would have been like a hollywood film with her falling for some local guy and being happy with her son in their new home but this is not hollywood her son gets kidnapped and murdered ostensibly because it is known she has cash from the settlement the grief process attempts at moving on attempts to clear her conscience of guilt are all done admirably and the lead actress is superb the only caveat and it has to be stated is that this is a depressing film you have to know that going in you want shin ae to go through her grief and find some measure of happiness again this is not hollywood it is korea and in korean cinema especially drama they pull no punches life is what happens to you great acting but sometimes a tough film to watch due to the goings on if you stay you'll be rewarded do that
<START> i just can't believe that these games can get so much better but they do unfortunately i had to rent a dreamcast to play it but even though i did beat it i can't wait to buy it for ps2 this is the only series of games that i must own all of them even if i have beaten them many times over i hope they never stop making this type of game even if the series must come to an end br br
<START> at least during its first half if it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes it would have been a much better and tighter film the second half of the film is worth it especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships but it's like a dull toothache getting there also don't watch this film just because ginger rogers is in it she has an important role but it's a small one br br the film starts out showing three new york city buddies working the tourist trade and also in good natured competition for the hand of sally ginger rogers a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue world war i breaks out the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle yet enlist in the navy anyways the one of the three with the least industry as a civilian bill boyd as baltimore winds up the commanding officer to the other two robert armstrong as dutch and james gleason as skeets to make matters more complex sally has fallen in love with one of the three but doesn't have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war br br the film is a little more interesting on board ship mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable however james gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible br br one real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design or i should say the lack of it in the scenes in new york just prior to wwi we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 no effort was taken to bring this film into period br br in conclusion if you watch the few scenes with ginger rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission you've seen everything here worth seeing the rest is padding
<START> the man in the attic is a movie set in the 1910s it is inspired by a true story unfortunately it's a story that really didn't need to be told br br looking at the box the people responsible for packaging the movie tried their best to make this film appear steamy and erotic they use terms such as illicit passion forbidden affair and unlimited pleasures they even show a picture of neil patrick harris little doogie howser m d holding a gun br br the story involves krista played by anne archer she is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns his own business edward harris is an employee of her husband's company krista and edward end up falling in love with each other br br the supposedly shocking part of the movie is this krista's husband finds out about the affair and forbids them from ever seeing each other again so what do they decide to do krista ends up having edward live up in their attic wow krista ends up seeing someone else and edward gets extremely jealous so on and so on and so on br br the man in the attic doesn't cover any new territory it's a showtime original picture which explains why the stars are a couple of b list actors and both appear briefly in the buff br br
<START> before this little black and whiter the touchy topic of criminal rape never made it onto the american screen there were lots of these topics that hollywood and the production code kept hidden until the rebellious 1960's so it's not surprising that it would take a little independent company like ida lupino's filmmakers to raise the subject the result is well meaning but somewhat compromised which is not surprising since director lupino had to work with code demands to get the movie released br br interestingly ann walton's mala powers main problem following the assault is not how others might see her but how she sees herself and it's a heavy load she's carrying will she ever be able to relate to men again will they look at her as spoiled goods after all this is 1950 small wonder she runs away rather than face these anxieties at home and at work even though family and friends are generally supportive overall this first part is earnest and well done the chase is hyped to inject some action into the plot but then this is a movie notice how the incurious neighbor fails to respond to the honking horn near chase's end had those been screams of alarm from powers instead the neighbor's lack of response would have raised an interesting albeit complicating issue br br the second half is pretty much given over to the production code in the sentimentalized person of rev ferguson tod andrews it's he to quote a phrase who gives her courage to face life again there's some effort at humanizing him is it ann or her dilemma that he's most interested in still his gentle and understanding presence comes across as a little too miraculous and a little too hollywood fortunately the ending avoids the usual hollywood cop out by emphasizing only the hope of a happy resolution for ann rather than its certainty br br give lupino a ton of credit for dealing with the topic in the first place given the overall results i expect she dealt as honestly with the topic as she was allowed to i also expect today's audiences find the treatment mildly interesting mainly because of powers' excellent performance that brings out the purely human drama however the film works best now as a document of its time and what the cultural watchdogs of that day thought was appropriate for adult viewing
<START> i thought it was an original story very nicely told i think all you people are expecting too much i mean it's just a made for television movie what are you expecting some great wonderful dramtic piece i thought it was a really great story for a made for television movie and that's my opinion
