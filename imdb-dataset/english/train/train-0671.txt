<START> dick tracy wasn't the best for many comic book fans because they wanted something with blood like batman dick tracy plays the innocence of just being a comic book with villains that have severe appearance disorder and being fun warren beatty directs and stars as the main character that fights crime without even using super powers i have liked dick tracy since i was a child because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors red blue orange yellow green and black this is the perfect film for anybody to watch with their children al pacino is like the jack nicholson in batman and plays big boy caprice with zest madonna as the babe who is the second villain in this film doesn't play the same boy toy she represents like i said no blood obscenities sexually innuendo or anything to offend anybody
<START> brian de palma's undeniable virtuosity can't really camouflage the fact that his plot here is a thinly disguised psycho carbon copy but he does provide a genuinely terrifying climax his blow out made the next year was an improvement
<START> dog days is one of most accurate films i've ever seen describing life in modern cities it's very harsh and cruel at some points and sadly it's very close to reality isolation desperation deep emotional dead ends problematic affairs perversion complexes madness all the things that are present in the big advanced cities of today it makes you realize once again the pityful state in which people have lead society br br the negative side of life in the city was never pictured on screen so properly i only wish it was a lie unfortunately it isn't therefore 10 10
<START> i'm sure this is a show no one is that familiar of and might not think good of it after all it is almost close to baywatch hawaii with the cast the location style of the directing and its publicity Â shows women walking around on the beach and all that no wonder people have misconception and decide not to watch it br br it was wrong of them to do that cause after i decide to watch the show there are actually more thing going on real juicy story and conflict turn out to be really exciting to watch and pretty much Â addictive br br the story of the hotel clerks the manager the owner and their complicated love life also enter the troublesome hotel's visitor and powerful man trying to steal the hotel it actually more exciting than it sounds here br br i won't deny that the acting suck but it ain't that bad that you'll look away the story is not so consistence but good enough the soundtrack is fitting pretty well with the scenario and the action is all the time i took me couple of episode before there is actually anything happen solidly so be patience br br recommendation i really do enjoy watching this zillion times better than expected br br rating 7 5 10 grade b br br please rate my review after reading it thanks

<START> that is the only question i am left with why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast why was the writing so bad it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters why did it not make any sense at all why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and hollywood the hell out of it when all it needed was good smart story telling why i never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they're released i hope for the sake of freeman an spacey who are oscar winners that this never is released to the big screens in america br br as someone that holds a bachelors degree in journalism the whole story is just utterly laughable i just think the script had potential but the execution turned it into a clichÃ© and an awful one at that just no
<START> i'm usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance the only true upside to this film is cornelia sharpe looking rather attractive and the fact that this film is really short br br the plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film none of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone i'm not sure why on earth sean connery agreed to do this film but he should have definitely passed on this one br br the only reason i could see for seeing this film is if you are a die hard sean connery fan and simply want to see everything he's done save this one for last though br br well if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review or any of the other reviews on this site then i hope you enjoy it more than i did thanks for reading
<START> i love this movie 10 out of 10 hands down it is that damn good i am not much of a fan of movies but i gotta tell you this one opened my eyes astounding color and fast energy i was fortunate to catch this at a screening during the zoinks film festival in boston and the story really enveloped me from the start it had a lot of adult themes and character and when it ended i wanted more i hope they make a sequel that would be fun my only problem with it is the performance of melissa connor as anya ugh she sucks i've seen a block of wood pull out a better performance i don't what the director was thinking when he cast her but if you ignore her you can't help but give this movie a big ten
<START> one of the things that makes this ealing comedy so outrageously funny is the clever editing shots that would be considered absolutely essential to most modern comedies are deliberately left out this is what was known as british understatement br br three instances a comic fight is edited like this alec guiness has invented a new cloth that will ruin the industry half a dozen businessmen invite him to their office to try to get him to sign a contract relinquishing his control of the cloth so that production can be suppressed when he catches on to this guiness stands up and turns to walk to the door two men block his way excuse me he says quietly taking a step forward the two men move between guiness and the camera cut a secretary is sitting outside at her desk there is silence until the buzzer begins signaling her frantically she takes up her notebook and opens the door to the inner office where a full fledged noisy donnybrook is in progress and the room is half wrecked guiness dashes out the open door br br the following example would be unthinkable today during the research phase of his invention guiness sets up an elaborate chemical apparatus but instead of converting the experimental liquid into the new cloth the device explodes again and again it explodes the laboratory is cleared of all other work the blasts continue ceilings fall down windows are blown out the director of research is seated at his desk in a tiny office cluttered with debris a bandage on his head when the door behind him opens he jumps a foot in the air sit down he tells his visitor there's another one due at any moment it is excruciatingly amusing and there is not a single shot of any explosions this would be unimaginable now without a fireball and maybe a building collapsing in slow motion br br last example consisting of a series of quick relentless cuts put together precisely guiness is being pursued and is cornered in the lobby of an office building by people who want him to sign the contract faced with two men about to grapple with him guiness backs up with a determined expression he bumps against a pedestal with an iron bust on it the bust topples backward and bumps against the wall there is a shot lasting about one second of the bust hitting the wall another brief shot of a metal shield hung above the bust being jarred loose and falling down quick cut to guiness's head rising into the frame cut to the two men staring into the camera while horrible brass banging and thudding sounds are heard off screen cut to guiness flat on his back nobody today would have the cojones to not show guiness being crowned by that shield br br i won't go on with this it's a comedy alright but a pretty bitter one underneath all the hilarity in solving one set of problems guiness has created dozens of others he is opposed both by management and labor neither of which is shown to much advantage and of course the economic implications have to do with more than cloth what about that car that runs on water with a pinch of something or other in it one of the workers asks vested interests comments another worker as thorstein veblen nods in his grave what would happen if our problems with energy were solved overnight if i owned shares of exxon and i think i do i'd shudder at the thought where would the oil industry be if there were no more need for oil for that matter where would the police force and the fbi be if crime were to suddenly disappear this is a thoughtful and very amusing movie superbly directed and edited the roster of performers is peerless joanne greenwood with that husky voice the blithering cecil parker the wheezing mummified ernest thesiger br br a first rate job all around
<START> it's rare nowadays to find a romantic comedy that isn't incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire movie eg big fat greek wedding me myself irene there were only a couple of unnecessarily demented jokes in this movie nothing unpalatably profane all around it was a cute movie with likable characters i thought the ending was a little abrupt it feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up finish the acting left a little to be desired but was made up for by the pace of the story if i'd known it was a farrelly brothers movie i would have assumed it to be a stomach turning piece of garbage and not watched it but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making an okay movie good for them i hope they pull their heads out the rest of the way and start consistently making good films
<START> i don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said but this is one of the best series ever it was a great shame when it was canceled and i hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again the good news is that it is out on dvd i rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as good as i remembered it gary cole is a wonderfully dark and creepy character and all actors were very good it is a shame that the network did not continue it shaun cassidy this is a masterpiece anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it must do so you will not be disappointed my daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television she is 20 is becoming very interested and will soon be a fan she finds it very twisted and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen i cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired br br this show rocks
<START> i found this movie thought provoking and its ambiguity refreshing in a world of quick fix films where we are manipulated into loving the good guy and hating the bad guy scott cohen a very handsome television actor does a great job of portraying the family black sheep lost child who aspires to gain his father's love and respect as well as that of his widowed sister in law with whom he apparently has a history judd hirsch plays against his usual good guy image as a father who triangulated his sons and now is left with the one he always rejected br br when i saw this at the tribeca film festival i was enchanted by the lovely way the sawdust was used to portray a family tradition as explained by the director br br this is a fitting successor to the classic ordinary people i just realized judd hirsch was in that too
<START> unbelievably bad acting a no good unclear story and flashy images and slow motions where they are needed the least adrenaline is everything a movie should not be br br georgina verbaan a so and so dutch soap actress who hasn't attended her english classes plays rich girl freya who has the habit of 'thrill seeking' which basicly is doing dangerous stunts break stuff and annoy people and not in a fun jackass way then there's dracko rivas he kinda leads the bunch but has other illegal activities on the side then there's freya's dad lockyer who plays a dubious role as well and in the end we got jason debutant fyall the boyfriend of freya br br one day freya gets disappeared and everybody seems involved but we the viewer really don't care as nobody of the cast is either likable or believable and the story doesn't make any sense br br why was this even made 2 10
<START> been lurking for a couple of years or so i have never been moved to post on here before so perhaps this movie is worth a star for that but i doubt it i just watched it on dvd having missed it in the movies due to illness and never got around to watching it till now i had not read extensively about it certainly not even thought about the movie in some months it was just what the buddy picked up in the store so it got watched br br bad mistake br br the shot i spoke of in the the summary up top is in the trailer and on the poster right from the off jason statham has hair like in no other gr movie or any js movie that i've seen at least not in the quantities on display here and ray liotta in underpants should be advance warned it's scary and funny but not in a ha ha humour way its more in an almost theoffice but slightly mutated and so failing sort of humour way they each say the same thing this movie is not like anything you expect this movie to be br br now based on previous extensive movie watching experience i expected this movie to be a few things like br br coherent br br interesting or engaging br br not a complete and utter farrago of navel gazing br br something more substantive than a motley bunch of badly realised fables from what is just a standard eastern mystic ideology dressed up as a cool modern self aware art form br br hopefully better than the idiots br br as you may have guessed by my tone it thoroughly failed to check any box above instead it was br br x badly edited pace all over the shop 70s amateur high 8 style jump cuts incomprehensible plot twists delivered through hackneyed flash back montages i could go on br br x shot as if by a depressed 14yr old goth who'd just spent the weekend watching truffaut and godard with the drapes drawn br br x so up its own behind with the whole i'm really smart me motif message that it feels determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so just to make sure the dumb people ie everyone who doesn't like it in the audience make sure they get the point br br x a genuine waste of my time br br as for the undoubted ability of some people to get something from this fine i'm glad you enjoyed it one poster said something that caught my attention under 25s probably understood it better because of the editing maybe but editing is supposed to make your work more accessible not less as for the genius is only recognised by the enlightened brigade out there go suck an onion and grow up there is nothing more presumptuous and self serving than people who say the reason another person doesn't know great art is because they don't understand the 'craft materials moon cycle filaments of supreme rational thought' which the 'auteur poet artist palm reader idiot savant' is using to explain his or her 'vision grand scheme oneness with gaea great big bucket of dog sick' br br for me and many many more people its garbage br br movies art stories poetry anything designed to be viewed by another human is supposed to be engaging and moving in some direction be it metaphorical spiritual emotional or whatever you're having yourself br br the only way this moved me was forward in time two hours closer to my own inevitable demise the greatest trick he ever pulled was making you believe any part of this movie meant anything at all br br and now please by all means toast my buns for me
<START> very interesting the big twist wasn't as big a shock as maybe they had hoped for and it was very dated but it did get my mind working it really got me thinking about a world without vegetation or livestock and made me appreciate the world i live in a lot more charlton heston does a good job as do all the supporting characters and it was a very realistic film which was surprising it lacked direction at times and a lot of the settings and background needed more explanation but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie the main fault that i could find was that i didn't want the film to end when it did i would have liked to see what happened next br br 7 10
<START> why review good movies when you can review trancers ii br br ooh this film is soooo lame i can just picture the cast and crew driving around l a with a camcorder hurling extras in silly monster make up at poor long suffering tim thomerson the stars' families actually turn up to play cameos probably because full moon couldn't afford real extras lame effects lame sets and a script so convoluted it would take eons to untie all the knots this must be classic trancers br br and yet and yet it rules note this is the same thing i say about trancers iv i say it because it's true what can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies then bust out with quips like don't worry ladies they're bio degradable well lots of things could be better but anyway this is still good stuff br br my only significant reservation is megan ward who really stinks up the joint she's a lousy rival for helen hunt's character they're both young pieces of eye candy and it would've been more effective if they actually contrasted a bit more oh well you can't have everything at least the wonderful plot device of the long second watch is back in place and we've got more of hap ashby the least convincing athlete in the history of cinema oh wait a minute he's got a rival in the form of david ogden steirs in creator br br i haven't seen this lately but i do seem to remember that martine beswick runs away twice during the final battle hooray for lousy continuity just one of the many highlights in this fine film
<START> given the opposite circumstance of 2009 where the reality is we do have a black president this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance for entertainment value i found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant i was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time but also found the music and dancing incredible also it is quite cool to see sammy davis jr as such a very young child actor he plays rufus jones a young boy who is being consoled by his mammy he is told 'why some day you could be president' this was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and thought to be endearing charming and funny the bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man they depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist baptist church br br the fact was when i stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in it is really well done and very entertaining i believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us in fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president but that it is normal just makes this movie that much more relevant it clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness
<START> this movie blows you off your feet this debut movie from tom barman known from the belgian rock band deus introduces you to 8 intriguing people building blocks of a compelling movie mosaic they each survive one day and one night in the metropole of antwerp barman paints his characters with great deal of verve and competently interweaves their individual stories a tour the force that reminds of the best work of robert altman and paul thomas anderson the patchwork of anecdotes surprises moves amuses the dialogues are so natural they seem to be improvised some great performances by matthias schoenaerts natali broods and the extremely funny duo from ghent jonas boel and titus de voogdt sam louwyck is the memorable windman a bizarre guy dancing throughout the movie sam is also responsible for the stunning choreography and of course tom barman himself took care of the ultra cool sound track we were seriously impressed any way the wind blows is a movie that blows you off your feet
<START> this really is a great movie some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by fred and ginger is among their best ever but basically all of fred and ginger's movies are the same after the singing and dancing is over it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work what really bothers me is why all the negative comments about randolph scott his romance with harriet hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why i watch this over and over again he adds to this movie he doesn't detract from it he has a winning personality and a great smile randy is in my top ten all time favorites list it's great to see him as something other than a cowboy ok so he isn't really a great actor but like so many other stars errol flynn alan ladd victor mature etc he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions all of fred and ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour i just wish more people would appreciate randy and i felt a need to stand up for him
<START> for the life of me why did this film receive an r rating while it is about flesh eating zombies believe it or not it's actually a pretty good family friendly film at least if your kids are age 10 and older unlike the traditional zombie films this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional values albeit a bit twisted the language isn't a serious problem there is no nudity and the film style is definitely geared towards kids much like the old tv show eerie indiana yet some knucklehead slapped an r rating one it believe me most kids have seen worse violence than this and it just seems silly to make audiences think this is an adults only film br br the story is set in a parallel type world while the fashions cars and mores appear circa 1953 in this bizarro world there has been a fierce recent zombie plague that resulted in the zombie war and massive changes in everyday life at school kids are trained in armed combat and there's a cute scene late in the film where the father gives his son a handgun and tells him to keep it in his backpack just in case as for life outside of school it's pretty weird as well as people now have learned that zombies aren't such a bad thing heck using shock collars and training they can be made into slaves who can do your housework clean streets deliver milk or in the case of a really sick guy be your special friend br br this film deals with one particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave played by billy connally mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombie's friend dad on the other hand isn't convinced as he was forced years early to kill his own zombie father and he hasn't yet gotten over this funny irreverent and unique this film needs to be seen by a much wider audience
