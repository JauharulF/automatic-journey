<START> the banner says it all this is one really bad movie which is sad because i normally like sheffer and i have been impressed with andrea roth in other roles this however is terrible i wont waste any more time its just that bad
<START> the 1967 in cold blood was perhaps more like the real thing think about it would we really want to see the real thing but it was black and white in a color world and a lot of people didn't even know what it was and there was an opportunity to remake it for television plus if you remake it you can show some stuff not shown in the original the book in cold blood by truman capote was the first nonfiction novel truman's book was in fact not 100 true to the real story i thought the canadian location sufficed for kansas pretty much for a tv movie look for the elements of sex drugs and rock 'n' roll dick's womanizing perry being an aspirin junkie perry playing blues guitar
<START> i am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film thought visually stunning like all of ang lee's work each still frame seems worthy of a print i was really disappointed by the film's disjointed pace it really was too long br br the story is set in civil war era missouri and is about a young man roedel who joins the feral forces of the bushwackers sort of renegade confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the jayhawkers their union counterparts he and his close friend jack bull chiles played by skeet ulrich join the group after chile's father is shot point blank and his home is burned presumably by jayhawkers the story follows roedel's and chiles' raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war including former slave who fights for the bushwhackers daniel holt played by jeffery wright and a war widow played by jewel br br it seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped for example the agitation among roedel's group caused by former slave holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol and then dropped until later in the movie a young villian bully bushwhacker hates roedel and directs much angst and violence against him but we never know why some of the characters never seem to surface i think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history br br the historical detail was excellent i loved looking at the housing furniture clothes etc and i thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters though they stumbled a bit with the dialog unless you really enjoy history or are a huge ang lee fan though take a pass on this one
<START> story of a wrongly executed prisoner who haunts the prison he was electrocuted in and kills random prisoners while waiting to take revenge on the man who framed him br br viggo mortensen is great and the acting is pretty good overall lane smith is deliciously wicked as the guilty warden also this film has some great gore including death by barbed wire mummification
<START> i have recently watched this movie twice and i can't seem to understand why the h ll the makers made this pile of crap i mean yes it gives a great impression of hitler's environment and i mean the way they reproduced austria in the late 1890's wwi and the inter war period what i can't understand is why they pictured hitler as a 100 pure evil mad unreliable mentally unstable freak he was after all a very thoughtful loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides no doubt about that but why in heaven's name portray him in this way all of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario leaving nothing but a very propaganda like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever yes he threw germany into the devastating 2nd world war yes he was racist and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war all true but again why the hell did they plain lie to the public to warn us br br i absolutely don't think this movie was a warning the true danger of hitler and the nazi's was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness the fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every german alive not to mention austrians and a lot of other people makes it a warning to modern civilization not the fact hitler was such a 'weirdo' if it would have been like the makers make us believe i would have been convinced that the german people were retarded a man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader not to mention reichskanzler br br 4 10
<START> i tried restarting the movie twice i put it in three machines to see what was wrong did steven seagal's voice change did he die during filming and the studio have to dub the sound with someone who doesn't even resemble him or was the sound on the dvd destroyed after about 10 minutes you finally hear the actor's real voice though throughout most of the film it sounds like the audio was recorded in a bathroom br br i would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to goodwill if i owned a copy i rented it but i will never do that again i will check this database before renting any more of his movies all of which were more or less good movies you usually knew what you were getting when you watched a steven seagal movie i guess that is no more
<START> i finally sat down and saw this film the whole way through and i must say i was very impressed michelle rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses it's not only the fact that she can act but that she chooses the roles best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first seem i've read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand but i certainly disagree diana is a feminist she follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinks with the exception of her caring brother tiny and her trainer and manager hector who proves to be more a father figure than her real parent which is what the word feminism is all about it's good to see films like this showcasing the true side of feminism that they're not a bunch of manhating losers but that they have dreams and can do anything diana is true to herself while still falling prey to love and she and adrian have a more realistic complicated relationship rather than just something that magically works out girlfight is a true taste of reality and it put some faith back into my perception of people thanks michelle br br 8 10 a very important movie that's relatable to not just young women but everyone wanting to go far in their lives
<START> this is one of those so bad it is good films that you always hear about but never see unlike troma films which are deliberately bad and campy and i am not amused this one is 100 pure serious br br however with features such as a supposedly super lethal killer robot that prances about like one of the solid gold dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the good witch of the east the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to entertaining br br watcheable enough because of that
<START> a couple of years back i had purchased and enjoyed the mgm double feature dvd of the two kolchak tv movies the night stalker 1971 and the night strangler 1972 when the universal set of the subsequent tv series came out i had intended to buy it immediately â but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded dvd 18s kept me from adding it to my collection recently i placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted universal box sets and decided to pick up the kolchak 3 discer as well br br having watched it now i can safely say that i didnât regret acquiring this beloved if short lived crime horror series one bit it may follow a standardized formula â dogged and resourceful newspaperman carl kolchak marvelously played by darren mcgavin gets into everybodyâs hair with his attitude flustered editor simon oakland long suffering colleagues assorted authoritarian figures a plethora of monsters and villains faces up to the inevitable and usually supernatural threat alone but finally is pressured into keeping his story under wraps â but a winning one further boosted by an impressive line up of guest stars and notable behind the scenes credits making the show a great deal of fun br br that said quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired for instance the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment â not to mention the fact that these were restricted to 50 minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes in the case of the werewolf again heâs never seen biting anyone but somewhat foolishly is made to merely throw people around br br while the heroâs cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots thereâs a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode often but not exclusively revolving around mcgavinâs relationship with either oakland or geeky reporter jack grinnage â to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere the setting for the most part is chicago and suspense to make the ride even more pleasant thereâs a bouncy score by gil melle' and jerry fielding br br for the record the monsters encountered but not always defeated by kolchak throughout the series are a revived jack the ripper a variety of cults voodoo native american aztec aliens vampire werewolf going round its over familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise liner doppelganger satanist swamp creature mass of electricity robot apeman witch headless motorcyclist succubus a knightâs armor taking a murderous life of its own the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast â featuring john dehner as a morose police captain hans conried and robert emhardt helen of troy and crocodile some of the actors other than those playing kolchakâs co workers return in the same roles â keenan wynn and ramon bieri both as officers of the law john fiedler as a shrewd morgue attendant and richard kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero if i were pressed to choose the finest or most entertaining episodes iâd lean towards horror in the heights co starring phil silvers and abraham sofaer and the afore mentioned the knightly murders â while as the weakest iâd go for the werewolf due to reasons iâve already explained and chopper based on a story concocted by robert zemeckis and bob gale br br unfortunately the set contains no extras it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in kolchak the night stalker as well as putting the series into the context of where tv was at the time of its original airing or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci fi series popular today in fact kolchak himself â in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise â returned in a 2005 revival this version is available at my local dvd rental outletâ¦but for various reasons iâm not sure iâd want to check it out so soon after the 1974 5 classic
<START> i enjoyed this film but i was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy it was amusing at times but really it wasn't very funny at all if i'd been expecting it to be a comedy i might have been disappointed with the film but going in with no expectations i found it to be enjoyable and engaging maybe it was because as an engineer i identified with the protagonist i was less concerned with satire of capital or labor and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention a man who's less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production he's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention so i find it interesting that people here have compared it to jurassic park me i compare it to the fountainhead
<START> drew barrymore was excellent in this film this role is the type of role you don't normally see drew play her typical role is as a woman looking for love the storyline is also great br br when holly is implicated in her mother's murder she moves to l a she moves in with a guy who becomes her lover but her brother who is in a mental prison hospital for what they believe is murder is almost killed she is wrongfully accused it is then revealed to her lover that she has multiple personality disorder after that another woman becomes paranoid when she's around her in the end though they find out the truth
<START> one of the best ensemble acted films i've ever seen there isn't much to the plot but the acting incredible you see the characters change ever so subtly undr the influence of the rented villa in italy and love and happiness the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you much as the villa does on all the women truly enchanted
<START> this is the magnum opus from the swedish king of crap mats helge olsson seldom has a movie of this magnitude been made in sweden and it truly stands out as one of the most amazing achievements in swedish film to date who pays for these things br br the russian nuclear scientist markov wants to defect to sweden but his plans are ruined by the russian military who kidnap him and tell him that he has arrived in sweden this trickery is their way of seeing to that markov continues his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply for the whole planet the cia however is bent on getting markov to the west and send their ninja to liberate him br br the practice of having swedish actors speaking english is something that mats helge has perfected in his later works the cheap b movie feeling this creates is probably unmatched for performance but besides this well the action is standard direct to video style machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke thousands of russians dying people running around in black ninja suits trying to hide in the snow br br what really stands out though is the insanely poor way the fighting scenes are choreographed when they say ninja in the title i expect martial arts i expect close combat but there are maybe two or three scenes of actual martial arts in this movie and they are hilarious it's so bad i lack the words to describe it if the ninjas moved any slower their hearts would stop and of course the whole movie ends in a bang that indicates a special effects budget consisting of four food stamps and a mcdonald's voucher br br so what's the verdict instant classic of course never before has a movie been made that is so obviously meant to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol it's the ultimate party movie insert into video and laugh one just has to realize that movies like these are not made any more this is film history br br therefore the rating is 8 10 for entertainment 1 10 for quality and 10 10 for accents
<START> rented a batch of films from blockbuster last night and this was the first one i watched it was late on a saturday night wanted a horror film fix br br wow this was awful almost embarrassingly so stupid slasher type story i really thought films like scream had put an end to amateur actors delivering clichÃ©d' and insipid dialogue that is hard to believe was actually typed and read off a page and gore scenes that are nothing to get excited about especially when occurring in a film this poorly scripted br br but i've always believed no film is 100 percent totally worthless here's the few good things i can say about this mess br br 1 bobbie phillips love this actress she's the only member of the cast who displays any acting talent whatsoever the only reason i took a chance on renting this is because her name was on the front cover she acquits her presence in this dreck with professionalism even though she looks bemused at times that she's acting in such a moronic story br br 2 unintentional hilarity this is the kind of film i can remember seeing back when there were still grind house theaters around the country and they used to include crap like this as the third movie on a triple bill with some prestige thriller movie that was finally making it's way to the hinterlands unfortunately in this direct to video age most viewers have to endure these turkeys alone now without the communal experience of being part of an audience jeering and throwing stuff at the screen because the film is so terrible which leads to br br 3 porn stars trying to act mostly on hand because the producers don't need to cajole or plead with them to disrobe for extended sex scenes but this trade off usually means they actually get to speak some lines that are supposed to advance a story other than ooh yeah baby or harder and proudly they all deliver expertly at looking foolish when trying to act i'd almost exclude ginger lynn allen from this group if her character wasn't supposed to be an irish mom and she's actually attempting at times to do an accent which just keeps the smiles coming br br it's nice to look for the positive in all experiences and that's what i took from this cesspool a k a evil breed
<START> this comedy has some tolerably funny stuff in it surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time and the plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this or they were simply making it all up as they went along 1 2
<START> i was drawn to this movie curious to see how they have adapted hubert shelby's brutal novel i thought that a literary piece of such depth with a rich tapestry of characters horrid situations and social critique could not translate into a bad movie i was wrong br br this flick is a terrible movie experience not for its content but for its form director ulrich edel executes in my sincere opinion a terrible directorial job that does no justice to the original book no wonder edel is a tv director this movie looks and feels like a bad made for tv flick some of my views on this bomb spoilers ahead br br lack of directorial creativity the scenes are slow feel slow look poorly shot and barely ever move from an anchored position the only liberty they take is in the cinematography area with a nice dark tone other than that the movie has the same technical creativity as a tv soap opera br br all the actors do a terrific job at portraying these miserable characters the problem is that the adaptation does not tackle a basic element in the development of the plot motivation all these characters move around like robots without a clear motivation for their action they seem to do things out of the blue like robots for no reason at all edel misses every opportunity to enrich character development by not exploring the character's motivations and by avoiding developing each character's personality to its full extent br br this lack of character development is blatant on tralala jennifer jason leight does a great job playing this trashy prostitute but her alcohol induced decision to let the sailors violate her is not explained it looks extremely stupid as we see this character doing this out of the blue this is a clear example of poor character development br br the movie also has many secondary token characters that do nothing feel nothing and add nothing to the plot i would have liked to learn more about harry's wife for instance and the interaction between the two that's another missed opportunity br br edel only approaches character development with harry and his fixation with his gay lover only to screw it up at the end not clearly explaining again his motivations the thugs are also a joke in their lack of development br br the soundtrack is one of the worst i've ever experienced terrible job by mark knopfler i seriously expected more from the former leader of dire straits but his job in this movie is seriously lacking at times like in the battle between the union workers and the police the music seems totally disconnected from the movie it also feels completely poor and anachronic i could swear the whole soundtrack was made with a casio toy keyboard it distracts from the actual action br br the book adaptation by desmond nakano is so literal that eliminates the point of the story it feels as if they tried so hard to keep the action by action storyline in the book that they forgot to actually develop the characters and once again explain their actions and motivations br br i seriously can not recommend this movie not even to a shelby fan because it can ruin the original book it's a very uninspired effort in adapting the novel and shows very little creative input
<START> as a knowledgeable fan i recommend this film as faithful to the facts and well acted as an 11 year old living in istanbul i heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream i thought hmmmm if girls like them they must be crap my only records until then were haley mills the everly brothers ricky nelson soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in ismir i heard a song which i later learned was 'love me do' and was floored by the difference between it and every song i had ever heard until then when i heard the 'meet the beatles' album of my older brother i was hooked for life having read the definitive book of their beginnings by davis i was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use it did touch on the use of methadrine dexadrine
<START> first of all i love good splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art but this zero budget flick is none of it the picture quality is so damned low the soundtrack the most annoying one i ever heard and as for the fx well the super low quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie what this junk here isn't no concept a wafer thin storyline primitive acting and rare dialog i think i counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie each one repeated about 20 times same for a lot of film sequences may be an indication for which kind of audience this crap was made the story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother got psychological damaged and as an adult goes touring performing a show of self mutilation so far so good but for these pseudo art idiot directors this plot is just a line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row which neither have a message nor make any sense freshly taken out bowels are thrown on a naked bound woman in an earth hole why and why is that the only time you see both woman and thrower in the whole bloody movie disturbing yes sick yes necessary no artistically no everyone mistaking this cheap gore show for art should as soon as possible visit his psychiatrist or should watch pink floyd's the wall to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an artful way i hope this was your first and last movie andrew cobb and all you gore heads out there remember not everything that looks cheap and makes obviously no sense at all is automatically art
<START> and i absolutely adore isabelle blais she was so cute in this movie and far different from her role in quebec montreal where she was more like a man eater i think she should have been nominated for a jutra i mean syvlie moreau was good but isabelle was far superior imo pelletier has done fine work for his first time out and i noticed he snuck in a couple of his buddies from rock et belles oreilles guy a lepage andre ducharme it was fun to see them in this i didn't know they were going to appear br br i don't think i've seen a romantic comedy from quebec that i didn't like and this one is as good as any i've had the pleasure to see and if you're in the states and wondering how you can get a copy of the dvd www archambault ca delivered it to me in less than a week
<START> this movie was absolutely terrible i can't believe i paid to see it in the theatre i wouldn't watch it on free cable t v i'm surprised that joe magtena even made it do not waste your time with this movie
