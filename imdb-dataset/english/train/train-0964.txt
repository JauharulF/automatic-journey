<START> the shirley jackson novel 'the haunting of hill house' is an atmospheric tale of terror which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion the atmosphere is well set out and the chills are staged well a haunting masterpiece br br the 1963 chiller 'the haunting' stays closely to the book but also adds its own details to the plot fortunately these are very few and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen the black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie excellent br br and then jan de bont made this in 1999 the remake of the haunting hit the cinemas if you could call this a remake why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself but for the moment lets look at the film itself br br it starts off averagely as most horror movies do the set used for hill house is beautiful and oddly mysterious and for a few minutes it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re telling and then the first scare comes a loose harpsichord wire slashes a woman's face dr marrow's assistant this is hilarious and truth be told it nearly had me in tears br br from then on the film just spirals downwards the acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on with owen wilson's character being particularly irritating so it's such a relief when he's decapitated by the flue br br the special effects practically make this movie which is a shame because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated examples of these are many so i won't bother listing them br br so all in all i along with hundreds of others strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller or as an alternative buy the novel by shirley jackson but please stay away from this and if you do decide to watch this watch it on the tv as a lot of the channels love to screen this film and not the original or rent it cheap but please don't buy it whatever you do don't waste your money br br final rating 4 10
<START> this movie made me very happy it's impossible not to love the smart and sweet orphan girl who changes the heart of a selfish lawyer only interested in pursuing success in her career this is a very optimistic movie and i sincerely believe that we need more films like curly sue it touched my heart
<START> a christmas together actually came before my time but i've been raised on john denver and the songs from this special were always my family's christmas music for years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was christmas a few years ago i was finally able to track down a video of it on ebay so after listening to all the music for some 21 years i got to see john and the muppets in action for myself if you ever get the chance it's a lot of fun great music heart warming and cheesy it's also interesting to see the 70's versions of the muppets and compare them to their newer versions today i believe denver actually took some heat for doing a show like this i guess normally performers don't compromise their images by doing sing a longs with the muppets but i'm glad he did even if you can't track down the video the soundtrack is worth it too it has some muppified traditional favorites but also some original denver tunes as well
<START> another episode from childhood that as an adult i look back on with a different perspective this was one of my favorite childhood episodes one that really cemented my adoration of this show however on viewing this episode after 20 years i'd say it is definitely one of the lighter ones played for laughs and amusement instead of the dramatic and well constructed story lines in previous episodes in this their first and best season perhaps this episode was written for a little fan r r too as mr spock would say the story just isn't logical but there are some amusing lines like of course mr spock's final one at the end when he asks the captain mccoy et al whether they enjoyed their r r and they answer in the affirmative he raises an eyebrow and says fascinating in only the way mr spock could do that an interesting story line of course the idea of an amusement park being actually amusing instead of the fake and often annoying amusement of disneyland for example being able to have one's wishes actually come true really a great idea but not that well executed and coming from theodore sturgeon another of the great sf short story writers they used in the first season one wonders how much tinkering was done to the script that sturgeon turned in br br now here is a little trivia i learned on this very site in 1987 james gunn established the theodore sturgeon award for best short science fiction story and i'll quote the rest from this site in 1968 he sturgeon wrote the joy machine a third script for the star trek tv series amok time the other that was never shot the main reason that it wasn't used in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget however the script was adapted into a book by sci fi writer james gunn star trek 80 the original series and published by pocket books in 1996 br br i'd sum this up to say this episode is still very enjoyable especially if one doesn't think too much about it just laugh and enjoy it and next episode we can get back to the serious stuff of protecting the universe
<START> ever since i can remember and i'm only 18 my mother and i have been and continue to watch older movies because well i find them much more rewarding in the long run but hey don't get me wrong i do love the movies we have today just not as much as i love movies of the 40s and 50s anyways now i have to say the moment i started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the tv of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by lucile watson but i loved the way betty davis and her family was portrayed the children did not act like children in the slightest but there is good reason for that having had to hid and run most of your life seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence so people saying oooo i hated how the kids acted blah blah blah read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see br br paul lukas dear paul did an amazing job now i know many people are mad that he go the oscar and bogie didn't but hey they both did amazing jobs so i think it could have gone either way but lukas' performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie i was reduced to tears i loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone d
<START> skip mission galactica and watch the original living legend episodes instead the network took parts 1 2 of living legend and jammed them into one plot with the awful fire in space episode although galactica suffered from network controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production living legend is the best of the 1978 tv series fire in space on its own is one of the worst episodes as a historical note watch galactica the original star trek and then the revival trek series and you'll see the difference in quality between network produced sci fi and syndicated sci fi
<START> this movie is very cool if you're a fan of tsui hark and chinese fantasy films you should love this this film is the asian lord of the rings a high fantasy story based in actual chinese mythology i realize many critics have called this film plot less i think they probably have zero knowledge of chinese mythology if you liked stormriders or warriors of heaven earth this one should be right up your alley this film is still very difficult to find in the u s even though it was purchased for u s distribution along with crouching tiger hidden dragon and iron monkey well worth the search this dvd is also worthy of owning
<START> the following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie 1 clichÃ©s abound seriously awful twists are everywhere br br 2 the narrative jumps around in time which would be fine if done well but it's not br br 3 lame characters that don't develop so much as either remain utterly static or drastically change for no good reason br br 4 big one horrible acting over the top from nearly every person br br the following are some of the best points from the movie 1 the lead is damn good looking br br as i see it there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie a people who can sit through 90 minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive br br b people who often think to themselves i like hollywood dreck rife with clichÃ©s and overacting but if only i could watch it in korean there's a lot of good korean cinema out there so why waste your time with garbage
<START> the deadly wake is the perfect movie for film students to learn how not to make a film br br let's see what did the crew mess up in this flick worst music mix worst editing worst script worst all time directing worst acting worst choreography worst cinematography worst props worst sets worst lighting etc let's face it if this film had been in ultra high contrast black and white and silent it still would have been awful all scenes are dark lighting people call it black often the music score drowned out the meandering dialogs which was ok because nobody ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect the evil robot was hilarious what was that jazz dancing oh i guess it was supposed to be walking tactically or something i'm sure it struck fear into the hearts of the poor editors and how do you edit so much footage of garbage not possible garbage is garbage no matter how you splice it how did anyone ever get this thru the dailys br br bottom line is i couldn't stand to watch more than 15 minute segments it was so bad but i did see the whole thing with lotsa breaks just to see if it had any good parts in it at all nope none br br a perfect example of how not to make a flick a must see for every serious film student
<START> everyone we meet influences our thinking modifies our ways a little bit of that person rubs off onto us the eighth day takes up this theme compare rainmaker in this film harry daniel auteuil a businessman expert in sales psychology meets up with georges pascal duquenne a down's syndrome child on the run winning performances from both these actors give this film its main strength the opening sequence is excellent where georges relates his theory on the creation of the world and in the closing scene we discover what god created on the eighth day there are some moments in the story that are very frustrating for harry for example georges who is completely uninhibited demands a pair of expensive shoes and hasn't enough money it's the kind of scene where you laugh through your tears i liked the scene where the down's syndrome group on a trip to the art gallery escape on a bus and gate crash the paradis fun park the most humorous of all the embarrassments is the scene where harry and georges pass a horse float on the highway and looking back georges gives the driver a rude salute but there are some gentle scenes as well especially the impressive use of close ups of hands hands feeling the sun wind and rain hands reaching up hands reaching out and clasping in love and friendship this is true cinema which touches the heart there are very moving scenes where georges proposes to nathalie where georges cradles harry's head in his arms where georges keeps calling for his dear mom where georges teaches harry to laugh i felt there was a profound message in the film that life is beautiful the very presence of grass did you know it cries when you cut it the trees overhead the song of birds the little insects all nature's miraculous creatures they are all there to be enjoyed if we but lie back like harry and georges look around us and listen a beautiful film
<START> zombie review 3 br br spoilers br br few films are actually so bad they're good and zombi 3 is not just bad it's wretchedly unforgivably bad in so many ways that a whole new language may be needed just to describe them all br br more than that it's a film credited to lucio fulci that even by his standards has absolutely no coherency sense or reason however we can't blame fulci as it wasn't really directed by him but by bruno mattei who doesn't even have fulci's sense of style to help carry the film mattei seems to have brought little to the film but staggering ineptitude br br so i'm ashamed to say how much i enjoyed every worthless minute of zombi 3 it has no redeeming features in a genre known for thin characters weak story and lack of film making skill zombi 3 pushes the boat out but in doing so it's even funnier than nightmare city br br the action starts when the death 1 gas is stolen from a military base and damaged in the escape who is the thief why did he steal it and why did the us military think that creating cannibalistic legions of the living dead would be a good idea all these questions and more will fail to be answered in zombi 3 br br after hiding out at a hotel the infected thief goes mad from all the green plastecine growing on his face before being tracked down by the army who somewhat foolishly decide the best way to dispose of his corpse will be to burn it sending death 1 up into the atmosphere resulting in zombie birds who then attack people and turn them into zombie people if zombies are cannibals why don't the zombie birds just attack other birds br br then we meet our heroes a trio of horny gis and a coachload of girls there's a couple of other guys with them too but they're not important no one is important here you'll be hard pressed to remember anyone's face let alone their name or find a reason to care about them they end up hiding out at the same hotel as the thief a week ago this place was buzzing with life now it's buzzing with flies but there's no escape from the undead br br by this point you'll either be completely sucked in or you'll have turned the damned thing off the script is so appalling even the greatest acting in the world couldn't save it so it's just as well they have some of the worst and not just the human characters the zombie acting here is an all time low there's no consistancy in how the zombies behave some shamble about in the time honored style others engage in full on fist fights or charge around with machettes not to mention the zombies who are still able to talk a gimmick that gives the film it's horrifying twist ending they die from gunshots to the chest rather than the head and even get knocked out by a good left hook how can you punch out a zombie in fact the emphasis on badly done 80s action often makes it resemble an episode of v br br the zombies also spend a lot of time hiding seemingly waiting for hours in ridiculous places on the chance some poor sap will pass by and get the fright of their life they hide in bushes in garages in huts on roofs in the water and even underneath pregnant women at one point a zombie follows a woman up the stairs to kill and eat her no to push her into the water those zombies and their wacky sense of humour br br there is plenty of gore though limbs are hacked wounds ooze green pus and there's much in the way of flesh eating and people getting their faces mushed in there's nothing to match the originals eyeball piercing but if bad make up effects are your bag you won't be let down br br all this and i've not even mentioned the awful music the inexplicable flying zombie head the scientist whose acting actually manages to stand out as really bad or the final chilling punchline in an ingenious twist on the originals radio station being overrun by zombies zombi 3 gives us an actual zombie dj he's gone over to their side our escaping hero's cry before vowing to continue fighting against the undead in a sequel that sadly never came br br zombi 3 is rubbish it would be no loss to the world if every single print was destroyed and all records of it's existence erased yet somehow i feel my life is richer for having seen it br br did i say richer i meant 88 minutes shorter
<START> this movie was not so much promoted here in greece even though it got good actors great script and rather good photograph was not a so called blockbuster movie in my country the movie itself is very powerful it's about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home village after been released from a 5yo prison time drugs the end is rather sad mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency 7 out of 10 because very few greek movies can make such an impression
<START> probably the most whimsical installment of the first season 'shore leave' has its ups and downs some parts drag on too long and others are unambitiously cut short but one can't deny they threw in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink to make this an entertaining episode kirk and crew seem to have found the perfect planet for shore leave after an extended tour of duty has left everyone on board in need of rest relaxation and so on it appears for all intents and purposes to be an uninhabited earth with beautiful scenery and an ideal climate the first indication that things might go just a little awry is when mccoy leading an advance team spots alice from wonderland following a large white rabbit wearing a vest kirk beams down and finds the others reporting similarly bizarre happenings and encounters the one thing they all have in common is that each crew member was thinking about the person place thing they discovered right before they discovered it this doesn't immediately sink in with kirk or anyone else more strangeness ensues including sightings of don juan a siberian tiger a ww2 fighter plane etc kirk meets up with ruth a gorgeous old girlfriend of course and a bully from his academy days finnegan the chase fight scene with finnegan goes on too long but at the same time mccoy is run through with a lance by a knight on horseback and apparently killed finally an elderly man appears and explains what has been happening the planet is a futuristic 'amusement park' where visitors have only to imagine something to have it appear nothing is permanent mccoy isn't really dead once this is explained kirk decides to order shore leave for everyone after all despite the 'it was all a dream' sort of ending 'shore leave' holds up as another first rate episode of star trek's first season
<START> once again canadian tv outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unwatched after its premiere episode br br last time i remember sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction we in the business call laughter how funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all muslims are terrorists ok maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses but not 30 minutes it's called beating a dead horse even snl would know to give up after a commercial break br br also let's have a little conflict in these scripts will she or won't she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast on ramadan when will ramadan start ohhhhh this is emmy winning stuff here br br and the characters what characters they are all cardboard cut outs without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next that's the point of the situation comedy we need to have strong interesting dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the tv set each week we have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble they're going to get into next week if i never see these characters it'll be too soon thankfully i can't remember any of their names note to cbc that's not a good sign br br and the acting is so bland it's more so a problem in casting than in the actors none of these people actually embody the characters they play they just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character make us fall in love with them where they become inseparable from the character the portray watch any american sitcom and you'll see how easily identifiable characters are part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next 8 years portraying that level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows but to be honest considering the lame concept and the horrible writing there's not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture as another commenter mentions this seems like a tv movie and not a sitcom br br and the directing or lack there of what can i say canada has so much talent look at what the comedy channel is doing with puppets who kill and punched up look at the trailer park boys not the movie cause it bit the big helium dog look at any american show to see the potentials our talent as that's where many of our stars go to find decent work br br give credit to the cbc they really know how to build publicity for a non event remember the one no well don't even try to learn any characters names in this show as it's sure to go the way of the dodo br br let's all hope for a full blown actra strike so that nothing like this emerges from the ceeb for a good long while
<START> should this be an american movie i'd rate it 7 we've seen this before being this an argentinean movie and being myself argentine i'd like to give it a 10 since it's the kind of quality i'd been hoping rather than expecting for it's superb quality is astonishing given all the limitations imposed by the 3rd world br br i can't forget the scene when dÃ­az forces silverstein's fiancÃ© to confess you know what i mean if you saw the movie i think that's the key moment of the movie not surprising maybe yet original that's when the real action begins br br before watching a movie i always try to gather some previous information being this a mainstream satyric commercial one i press play and make a suspension of reality and logic i'd say the best state of mind to enjoy movies like this it's impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot yet it's believable in a certain way as for me i couldn't stop laughing at every single joke and commentary sos malo you're mean put in the mouth of dÃ­az the greatest one br br i'm rather tired of seeing movies designed for peretti i know he's a superb actor but sometimes i feel his roles unfairly opaque the rest luis luque's role in this case i'm not very fond of argentine television so i haven't seen much work from luque but it's pretty obvious that he's an excellent performer his physical role his stares his content attitude in this movie made me fall in love with his performance i think his role should need some upgrading just to let him show us how great he can be br br i don't know whether szifrÃ³n is planning to make a sequel or not i know he won't make it if it's to follow the rule that second parts were never good so if he makes it i'll surely go see it and i hope that in the future takes into account the possibility to give peretti's counterparts the same chances to develop their roles br br great movie great performances and lots of laughs
<START> wow i love and respect pretty much anything that david lynch has done however this movie is akin to a first filmmaker's attempt at making a pseudo art video br br to give you a couple of examples br br 1 david lynch is typically a visual filmmaker however this had little visual artistic content blank walls up shots with ceiling in the background br br 2 david lynch typically takes great pride in audio however in this you could even hear the video camera's hum br br in fact it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie unless br br this is a joke on david's part to force fans search his website for hours only to find this drivel i hope so because at least that idea is funny
<START> gandhi the great br br greatness in the world is associated with people like alexanader the great ashoka the great for their greatness lied in being glorified as more than humans gandhi is called great for actually not being a great but being more human for i always believe bringing out the humanity in us is where the greatness of being human lies gandhi was a human with humanity and one who strived for humanity ready to sacrifice himself in the battle for humanity but not his enemies let me move to the movie review now br br about gandhi my father br br gandhi my father is a film not about gandhi but about his son harilal gandhi on telling the story of a son whose father was one of the greatest humans to walk this earth the director succeeds in portraying the tale the film succeeds in telling the story of a mislead son of a father who lead a nation to greatness the movie is termed as a criticism of gandhi's failure as a father to his son i would rather say it is of a sacrifice gandhi had made as a father of a son to do justice as a father of a nation br br i wish the essence of this movie prevails not just in india the gandhian land but through the hearts of all the people of this world br br gandhi the true human jaihind
<START> this movie is just like every other dutch movie so if you enjoy movies such as turks fruit and de kleine blonde dood then you might be okay with this one even though those two have much better stories and actors zomerhitte starts strong enough but even that one good scene ends up having nothing to do with the storyline there's a lot of nudity but me and others just could not find that girl attractive the dialog is laughable as we did a lot to the annoyance of other movie watchers and some of the scenes are so completely random that this is more of an unintentional comedy than anything else like a random scene in which an owl rips somebody's eye out it has nothing to do with anything and is only referenced once later in a sentence saying did you hear what happened i was there the only reason i gave it a 2 is because some of the places they are at look nice that's it and the reason i saw it was because we went to the sneak preview here in holland we have a strange system regarding sneak previews you pay less money then for a regular movie and you don't know what movie it is that you will be watching all you know is that it's a new movie that's not yet in the theaters my advice is to stay far away from this film if you really want to see a good dutch movie watch temmink or zwartboek

<START> this movie was awful in the worst way you just didn't care you didn't care what happened in the plot you didn't care about the characters everyone was devoid of heart i ended up walking out about an 45 minutes into it because i simply didn't want to subject my mind to it any more there is far too much sex in the film sex can be okay it can even make the movie hence karma sutra but the intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy it was just ugly don't see this film
