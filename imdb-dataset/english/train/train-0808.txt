<START> with the exception of about 10 sublime minutes with hb warner on the celestial train this was 94 minutes of jaw dropping horribleness the acting was atrocious but the story is what i really found appalling the acting was wooden and stilted even by early talkies standards the exceptions being lee tracy and hb warner neither of whom can do wrong rose hobart was absolutely horrid and lifeless as julie as she likewise was in 1932's dr jekyll and mr hyde an otherwise excellent flick and the rest of the cast was worse there being no words to describe their awfulness br br worse than the acting however was the story for some unknown reason julie loves liliom a cad and user of women with no redeeming qualities whatsoever he marries julie but doesn't support her instead lying in bed all day or hanging out with his low life criminal pal lee tracy and oh yeah he never has a kind word to say to julie and he regularly beats her julie loves him nonetheless and continually makes excuses for him which only seems to make him more abusive what's even sicker is that this movie presents this story to us as a love story somehow we are supposed to see julie as a noble character whose pure love redeems liliom wtf br br the last 1 3 of this movie takes place after liliom has killed himself a robbery plot goes awry and liliom plunges a knife into himself rather than being taken in by the police as he lay dying he tells julie i beat you all the time but i'm not sorry for it when he at last dies she finally tells him she loves him neither character ever said i love you to the other while they were alive after his death god's chief magistrate gives liliom one more day on earth so that he can do something good for his unborn daughter the price for this is 10 years in hell after 10 years liliom is allowed one day on earth to see his now 10 yr old daughter he approaches her in the front yard of her home and tries to cajole her into letting him do something good for her he tries to get her to play cards he tries to give her gabriel's horn but she's not interested and rebuffs him so he slaps her he slaps her and then he disappears back to the afterlife looking on we see his daughter tell julie about this the girl says the slap didn't hurt that it felt like a kiss this is supposed to be the movie's magical moment the girl asks her mother if such a thing is possible and julie replies that someone can be beat you and beat you and beat you and not hurt you at all then the music swells and liliom rides up to heaven in the celestial train blech br br there was one saving grace to this film and that is the interview between the chief magistrate hb warner was truly magnificent here and liliom on the celestial train the magistrate had some very profound things to say to liliom about life and second chances and death this scene alone made me bump this rating from 1 to 2 stars regarding liliom's suicide as a means for escaping his problems the magistrate says people suppose that when they die their difficulties are ended for them you thought that by killing yourself that you would cancel all your responsibilities it is not as simple as that on earth your name is still spoken your face is still remembered as long as one is left who remembers you so long is the matter unended until you have been completely forgotten you will not be finished with the earth even though you are dead some great sublime transcendental stuff amongst some of the most horrible trash i've ever seen br br by the way this story has apparently been filmed many times both as liliom and as the musical carousel
<START> this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that i've ever seen closely followed by none other than before sunset which technically isn't another movie at all since it's about the same two people and the same romance br br this is love in the real world ok that's only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie reading the other reviews it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog based movies as well and this is what makes before sunrise so good the dialog is perfect it's so real so engaging and funny it's hardly a surprise that jesse and celine fall in love 'coz you fall in love with them at the very same time br br my favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop where they pretend to phone their best friends with the other pretending to be said best friend it's perfect brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life br br i must say that if you have a choice do watch before sunrise before watching before sunset if like me you watched sunset first it's hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show br br once again the greatest romantic movie in my books wonderful acting excellent script and beautiful locations young love at it's best
<START> yes in 35 years of film going i have finally viewed the stinker that surpasses all other ghastly movies i have seen beating 'good will hunting' baise moi' and 'flirt' for sheer awfulness this is pretentious blige of the first order not even entertaining pretentious bilge the effects are cheap and worse pointless br br the script seems to have been written by a first year film student who doesn't get out much but wants to appear full of portent the acting is simply undescribably bad tilda swinton caps a career filled with vacuous woodeness with a performance which veers neurotically between comotose and laughable 'intensity' apparently some fool out there has allowed the director of this film to make another one be warned
<START> i gather from reading the previous comments that this film went straight to cable well i paid to see it in a theatre and i'm glad i did because visually it was a striking film most of the settings seem like they were made in the early 60s except for the shrink's office which was dated in a different way and if you leave the neve campbell sequences out the whole film has a washed out early 60s ambience and the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating for a first time director whose background i believe is in writing he has a great eye within the first ten minutes i felt the plot lacked plausibility so i just willingly suspended my disbelief and went along for the ride in terms of acting and the depiction of father son mother son husband wife parent child relationships the film was spot on william h macy a pleasure to watch seems to be filling the void left by the late tony perkins if this and magnolia are any indication tracey ullman as the neglected wife was quite moving to me it was a three dimensional depiction of a character too often viewed by society as two dimensional of course donald sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals the depiction of the parents bain sutherland reminded me in an indirect way of vincent gallo's buffalo '66 although toned down quite a bit i would definitely pay money to see a second film from this director he has the self discipline of a 50s b crimefilm director something p t anderson will never have yet he has a visual style and a way with actors that commands attention
<START> jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season late may and a good improvement on carrey's past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic tearfully somber moments elements of jim's real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy drama bruce almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good natured taste eight out of ten stars
<START> sarah silverman is really the flavor of the month comic right now is she really worth all the hype yes and no she is funny at times sometimes hilariously so her standup routine is actually quite interesting though not always funny other times you're feeling cheated by the media for overhyping yet another performer she is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to saying that they dig her intelligence and wit but if you corner them most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her and that's why they watch her she reminds me of why many men flocked to margaret cho and janeane garofalo even though neither of them are really hot now in terms of popularity sarah doesn't drink or smoke at least cigs so she should be hot when she's 60 so her fans especially the male ones can rejoice br br as for this show it's very much like her comedy when it works it's hilarious when it doesn't it's full blown tedium and very very boring the aids episode here is the best one it's consistently funny and has some really good satire in it brian poeshn's character has an unhealthy obsession with tab in one episode and it's hilarious seeing him in a tab t shirt but they never really go anywhere with it and it eventually wears out its welcome sarah's character in the series is rather annoying the gay couple brian poeshn and some other guy seems tacked on and never really does anything for the show as a whole and the supporting players including sarah's real life sister laura who doesn't look a thing like her are ok when the jokes hit they're brilliant when they don't they're awful and i mean really awful there's also an obsession with coprophilia here aka poop jokes which seems to have replaced actual wit and intelligence in comedy today so should you watch this show if you have a crush on sarah go for it you can gaze at her and pretend she's yours as for her show it's ranges from good to absolute zero
<START> the only kung fu epic worth watching the best training ever the main character spending a hundred day's on his knees outside the shaolin temple show how desperate he is to learn kung fu to fight the manchu dogs who have taken over china
<START> on the surface this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation that is how to become a true self by embracing the so called 'dark' side of human nature thus we have the darkling a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is recognition of men and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled more or less successfully br br however if we dig a little deeper we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from grace is collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl lesson 1 cars are persons embodied with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished just after that another character rubin buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once lost now found famous race car and is warned by the salesman lesson 2 just like any other person a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced in addition there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubin's own personal greed for more profit lesson 3 thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only but always as an end in itself then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and more importantly rubin's car the main character's assessment of the car's qualities is not just based on its outer appearance but also by a thorough look inside the engine room lesson 4 a car is not just to be judged by its looks it is what is inside that really counts there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collector's car this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson 3 br br there are numerous other examples in the movie of the 'car person' theme and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them but the point remains and i guess this is what i'm really trying to say that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or if you're a car devotee
<START> there is something about pet sematary that i never felt anywhere else maybe the fact i was a kid when i first watched it made this experience so memorable but as i keep watching it over and over again it never gets old and i never get bored from the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic ending there is something insane sad and scary at the same time and it keeps ringing in your head sometimes dead is better br br i don't think it would be useful to relate the whole story again all you need to know is it starts from point a the most perfect situation for a happy american family and step by step drowns to point b which is believe me the very end of all joy the music is perfect the story makes sense the special effects are cool and the pet sematary is the last place on earth i would be like i said sometimes dead is better
<START> i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie i guess i must have missed something the beginning is intriguing the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories that's the best part after the three go their separate ways the film splits into three threads that's when boredom sets in certainly the thread with the felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity unfortunately the director beat this one to death even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular bottom line a two hour plot thin listlessness if you suffer from insomnia view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep
<START> being a fan of movies like fire sale where's poppa airplane i saw this because it was mentioned favorably in the context of real comedies and satires like the aforementioned well wrong conclusion br br not only is this not funny it makes you angry because it isn't bad in a schlocky likable way but in a really bad way it's bad bad the script does not contain a single funny line which is rather in the way when you're trying to entertain your audience with humour br br adam arkin's speech impediment is probably the single most annoying thing in this movie still this cruelty of nature doesn't prevent him from being smug throughout the movie and he has a hard time not looking into the camera this amateur without charisma fits in nicely with the constant continuity errors and bumbling along of the story if you can find one br br ed mcmahon i had to think of jay leno another late night talk show person who always refuses to call himself an actor well i've seen a few leno movies and he's laurence olivier compared to mcmahon br br kenneth mars is good though in the few lines that he's given i'm not easily frightened by bad comedies so i kept watching and looking for all the quasi jokes every 5 minutes or so br br the movie actually becomes sort of a comedy as soon as alan arkin takes over he literally does starting 75 minutes into the movie he's in every scene but it's too little too late br br when movies try to fool you into believing their lack of professionalism is the reason you're supposed to like them because they have the right intentions they remind me of pupils that haven't prepared for an exam in those cases you have to remain strict and the grade has to be an 'f' but please don't assume i'm a teacher that is a profession with a respectability somewhere between politician and child molester br br if you actually look for a likable schlocky horror scifi movie that is fun to watch and does contain jokes try man with the screaming brain by bruce campbell or watch sunshine core if you prefer modern loud shallow scifi schlock those are equally funny albeit involuntarily
<START> i love memoirs of a geisha so i read the book twice it is one of the best book i've read last year i was looking forward to the movie and was afraid that reading the book would ruin the viewing pleasure of the movie i wasn't expecting the movie to be that bad some of the best part of the book was omitted from the movie and the characters were weak with hatsumomo li gong been the worst if i haven't read the book this movie would be a little confusing and inexplicable the plot outline of the movie states nitta sayuri reveals how she transcended her fishing did anyone see how or when sayuri became nitta sayuri forget the movie and read the book
<START> trawling through the sci fi weeklies section of the local video rentals store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i hadn't yet seen renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse my son is so jaded with current b science fiction that he hasn't bothered seeing this yet br br it must be noted i didn't see anything about cypher when it was released in australia it must have been very quiet or i just missed it br br well this was a really pleasant surprise this is also no b movie it's not a blockbuster of the epic variety and doesn't try to be more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it's plot to be fully savoured br br the special effects are powerfully presented when they are used my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view but they get it right at it's 2nd appearance that aside everything else is top notch in any case the affects are secondary br br i won't give anything away about the plot the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct though with very different content br br just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke the actor was born in cambridge england and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect it's a tad off key see the final twist of the plot and you'll see why that is such a brilliant choice and lucy liu is also just right with her will she kiss me will she shoot me edge br br i rarely watch movies several times within days this is one of them
<START> how can't you rate this movie with 10 10 i admit to say that this movie is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a story but history this is the first real' movie of cinema history le prince de galles' was first but it was not technically perfect enoughÂ and it has an undoubtedly huge international value these people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving and above all the shot is a beautiful shot and it's very moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that what a moment historic for science first because the lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons and for art later a movie to venerate
<START> definitely one of the most witty and twisted who dunnit i ever seen christopher reeve and micheal caine were brilliant and kept me going through the whole affair br br very classy set pieces and the props really lend a sense of atmosphere to the proceedings the minimalist feel works for the whole picture br br my only complain isn't with the film itself but the lack of a decent widescreen edition of the movie on dvd i own the fullscreen version which proves i love the film enough to endure fullscreen presentation but a awesome deluxe or 'special' edition would most surely get my cash
<START> and shot in vancouver with the 'mountains' of the low country of south carolina visible in the background for heaven's sake they should have reset the location there are no coastal mountains in south carolina period br br lame visuals they should have been beautiful and the story limped along br br i really don't understand why it was such a hit as a book although i have to admit it's one i haven't read as yet usually i read the book and give the film a miss there was nothing in this movie that made me want to buy the book or even borrow it from the library br br verdict the mermaid chair seemed pretty shallow to moi
<START> michael keaton is johnny dangerously in this take off on gangster movies done in 1984 maureen stapleton plays his sickly mother griffin dunne is his da brother peter boyle is his boss and marilu henner is his girlfriend other stars include danny devito and joe piscopo keaton plays a pet store owner in the 1930s who catches a kid stealing a puppy and then tells him in flashback how he came to own the pet store he turned to thievery at a young age to get his mother a pancreas operation 49 95 special this week and began working for a mob boss boyle johnny uses the last name dangerously in the mobster world br br there are some hilarious scenes in this film and stapleton is a riot as johnny's foul mouthed mother who needs ever organ in her body replaced peter boyle as johnny's boss gives a very funny performance as does griffin dunne a straight arrow da who won't play ball with crooked burr danny de vito as johnny's nemesis joe piscopo is great richard dimitri is a standout as moronie who tortures the english language but you have to hear him do it rather than read about it what makes it funny is that he does it all with an angry face br br the movie gets a little tired toward the end but it's well worth seeing and keaton is terrific as good boy bad boy johnny for some reason this film was underrated when it was released and like keaton's other gem night shift you don't hear much about it today with some performances and scenes that are real gems you'll find johnny dangerously immensely enjoyable
<START> unusual yes br br unusual setting for an american wartime movie new zealand br br unusual subject matter four sisters and their relationships with american soldiers from one bearing the illegitimate child of the dead son of a senator to another living with seven marines one at a time before being murdered by her returning pow new zealander husband br br unusual to see paul newman deliver such a poor performance so soon after his unforgettable role as rocky graziano in the brilliant somebody up there loves me br br unusual for two fine stars joan fontaine and jean simmons to leave so little of themselves on a movie br br unusual that i could be bothered to write a review of such a poor film give it a miss
<START> unlike many other films which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness man bites dog or their sheer violence most peckinpah films deliverance shocks by its plausibility certainly the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads both before and after everything starts to go wrong the moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with let alone show any sign of human affection towards them is among the most sinister in modern film the tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip and perseveres even after the final credits the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real the movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads particularly ned beatty and jon voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively burt reynolds too has never been better the film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' perhaps only get carter has done such an effective hatchet job on a region's tourist industry i can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished the oppressive atmosphere of se7en is the best comparison i can think of although so much of it is excellent of itself deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it it is unique
<START> paul verhoeven's predecessor to his breakout hit 'basic instinct' is a stylish and shocking neo noir thriller verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve played by jeroen krabbÃ© a gay alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes while there he meets the seductive christine halsslag renÃ©e soutendijk who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him even if it kills him br br paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on paul verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself and that is one of things i like best about him this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards and that doesn't happen very often i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work but you'll see what i mean when you see the film make sure you get the uncut version there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one i've mentioned but are lovely nonetheless a man gets eaten by lions another one has a pipe sent through his skull a boat is smashed in half lovely br br the acting in the fourth man isn't anything to write home about but it's solid throughout jeroen krabbÃ© holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer it is renÃ©e soutendijk that impresses the most though as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct but the original fatale did it best paul verhoeven's direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view all of which help to create the mystery of the story verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish but he obviously has talent and it's a shame that he doesn't put it to better use of all the verhoeven films i've seen this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across trust me it's worth the effort
