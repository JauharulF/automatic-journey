<START> within the first 17 minutes of director bradford may's darkman iii die darkman die we have already been subjected to a silly recap and accompanying voice over on the first two films hilarious over acting about three minutes of footage simply ripped from the second film and re edited slightly to seem like new footage and a lengthy advertisement the scarred and tormented title character watches about universal theme parks universal being the company that distributed this film yes darkman iii die darkman die is quite the handful when it comes to cheap cash ins on the success of a previous film br br this time around the disfigured anti hero peyton westlake aka darkman portrayed by mummy actor arnold vosloo locks horns with evil crime lord and lousy husband peter rooker played in a brilliantly over the top performance by jeff fahey and over the course of the 87 minute film grows to develop an affection for rooker's wife and daughter once again learning to care for another person br br blah blah blah br br this film is basically just a silly way for the studio to make some more money off of sam raimi's original film which i consider to be a great action suspense film br br oh yeah and there are also a number of silly sub plots including a villainess who supposedly was one of the original doctors to save darkman following his scarring and her seducing our hero into thinking she is an ally before revealing her nefarious plot to help rooker create more super human powered thugs like darkman apparently she can't just do the same procedure on the thugs that she performed on darkman why i can't really explain it because the movie certainly doesn't br br there's also an assassination sub plot involving a district attourney who is threatening to bring down rooker's organization and some other very silly things going on br br but it doesn't really add up this film feels like two or three episodes of a television show edited together more than an actual film the direction alternates between pretty good and downright sloppy a scene where darkman rides his train like vehicle and dodges a rocket launcher is just plain silly and the editing is a mixed bag the film just moves too quickly for anyone to really care what's going on and without spoiling it the final 15 minutes of this movie and indeed the entire series is just kinda i dunno another 15 minutes of mixed bag footage br br in fact commenting on the editing one of my favorite things in this film is watching for footage re used from the previous films and then looking for footage within this film that is repeated multiple times yes it's that cheap it's one thing to do a re cap at the beginning of the film and maybe repeat a shot or two but in the sheer volume they do it minutes of footage repeated from previous films it's just sloppy and amateurish br br also i have to say that darkman's psychedelic montage freak outs are a bit overdone in this film they are so stylized and overdone that they do work but only in light doses and in proper context as raimi did in the original film here there are at least four or five and they feel very abrupt and out of place br br that being said the film is not without some good points a few action scenes are well done the clichÃ© story of darkman yearning for a real life works suitably for a direct to dvd feature some of the acting is nice particularly from rooker's wife portrayed by the beautiful roxann dawson also while no danny elfman composer randy miller composes some nice music that builds off of elfman's original themes br br but overall the film is too quick cheap and silly to be taken seriously arnold vosloo seems alternatively bored and exuberant from scene to scene and fahey while a joy to watch as an over the top villain just doesn't quite fit in with the series br br like darkman ii i would recommend this to fans of the original who will surely get a laugh otherwise you need not apply a four out of ten
<START> pandro s berman was in charge of production but that made him the so called line producer but who produced this epic filmed not in arizona but in california's mohave desert where scavengers have made off with all of the remnants of the gold temple the thuggee huts the british outpost at muri the village of tantrapur etc the minor technical faults can and must be forgiven what's unforgivable is the lack of an oscar for best music although maybe the academy didn't offer such at the time a single theme was played in various tempos including waltz march and sweet mood setting brilliant one of the curious aspects of the production was the widow kipling's demands an actor playing kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes in the initial release his scenes were cut per mrs kipling's demands later they were included and lent a connection of kipling's immortal poem to ben hecht's screenplay interestingly this very typically and pro british story was by a great screenwriter who himself hated the british
<START> i ran across this movie at the local video store during their yearly sidewalk sale while scanning thousands of videos hoping to find a few cartoon movies for sale i came across this movie i read the back of the movie and knew it was god's hand at work for me to purchase this movie you see i have a sibling group of three foster and soon to be adopted children living with my family immediately my foster children made a connection with the three children starring in the movie the movie helped them better understand their own circumstances for the first time also the oldest of the sibling group 7 year old female decided to open up to me a little bit about her past and the trauma she had experienced she has been fighting the entire trust issue this is also the first time i had seen her cry after watching the film i asked her what it meant for a child to be adopted she replied it means to be happy a must see for families who are fostering children and are considering adoption it certainly opened the lines of communication with us
<START> cq is incredibly slow and i'm a david mamet fan the movie follows around a young filmmaker who is making a very barbarella esque film after that the movie started to lose me deep and profound not really the movie dragonfly being made in cq has the problem of having no ending this greatly parallels cq which also lacks an ending in my opinion br br i was lucky enough to catch this movie at the sxsw film festival i had fairly high expectations having just watched y tu mama tambien and several other great movies i was also looking forward to jason schwartzman's performance but it was not an easy film to get into if you're not into 60's sci fi or slow movies that go no where skip it br br cq feels like a student film if you want a recent sci fi esque indie film rent donnie darko it won't put you to sleep
<START> how is it possible that a movie this bad can be made bad acting bad script just an embarrassment all around this is just one bad clichÃ© after another br br this movie actually has some big name stars in it unfortunately they're singers and not actors br br this movie made hardly any money for a good reason the appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there it's a shame they didn't have a good story to tell br br this movie actually has some big name stars in it unfortunately they're singers and not actors br br this movie made hardly any money for a good reason the appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there it's a shame they didn't have a good story to tell
<START> richard chamberlain is david burton a tax lawyer living in sydney australia who is drawn into a murder trial defending five aboriginal men accused of murdering a fellow native in peter weir's apocalyptic 1977 thriller the last wave taking up where picnic at hanging rock left off the film goes deeper into exploring the unknown and in the process shows the gulf between two cultures who live side by side but lack understanding of each others culture and traditions weir shows how white society considers the native beliefs to be primitive superstitions and believes that since they are living in the cities and have been domesticated their tribal laws and culture no longer apply br br from the start burton is drawn deeper and deeper into a strange web of visions and symbols where the line between real time and dream time evaporates water plays an important symbolic role in the film from the opening sequence in which a sudden thunder and hailstorm interrupts a peaceful school recess to burton's discovery that his bathtub is overflowing and water is pouring down his steps as violent and unusual weather continue with episodes of black rain and mud falling from the sky the contrast between the facile scientific explanations of the phenomenon and the intuitive understanding of the natives is made clear burton and his wife annie olivia hamnet study books about the aborigines and learn about the role of dreams in the tribal traditions when he invites one of his clients chris lee david gulpilil to his home for dinner he is disturbed to find that he is the subject of an inquiry by chris and his friend charlie nadjiwarra amagula an enigmatic aborigine sorcerer involved with the defendants as burton's investigation continues his clients make his work difficult by refusing to disclose the true events surrounding the murder br br after chris starts to appear in his dreams burton is convinced that the aborigine was killed in a tribal ritual because he saw too much though chris refuses to acknowledge this in court burton becoming more and more troubled by a mystery he cannot unravel says to his stepfather priest why didn't you tell me there were mysteries this is a legitimate question but according to the reverend the church answers all mysteries burton knows now that he must discover the truth for himself and enters the tribal underground caves though we do not know for certain what is real and what is a dream he comes face to face with his deepest fears in a haunting climax that will leave you pondering its meaning into the wee hours of the morning br br in this period of history in which native hopi and mayan prophecies predict the end of history and the purification of man leading to the fifth world the last wave though 25 years old is still timely the aborigines are portrayed as a vibrant culture not one completely subjugated by the white man yet i am troubled by the gnawing feeling that we are looking in but not quite seeing weir has opened our eyes to the mystery that lies beyond our consensual view of reality but he perpetuates the doom orientation that sees possibility only in terms of fear showing nature as a dark and uncontrollable power without a hint of the spiritual beauty that lives on both sides of time
<START> on his birthday a small boys tells his mother he is not her son and that he wants to go home to his real mother br br in some ways comedy de l'innocence feels like it comes from a different time of movie making perhaps the 60's or 70's certainly it reminded me of losey's secret ceremony 1968 and richard loncraine's full circle 1977 both of which deal with loss grief and relationships between parents and 'lost' children curiously both films star mia farrow br br all three films are populated with unsympathetic characters who behave in strange and unexplained ways all three films have a chilly feel both emotionally and literally all three films focus on mother child relationships and ultimately all three films pose the question 'what is real what is imagined ' br br beautiful but flawed it offers no easy answers and leaves much hanging unexplained and strange
<START> the movie is wonderful it shows the man's work for the wilderness and a natural understanding of the harmony of nature without being an extreme naturalist i definitely plan to look for the book this is a rare treasure br br
<START> my life is about saving animals i do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization i am a vegetarian because i couldn't kill an animal even to sustain my life i can't even kill a spider i put it outdoors the scene where the children throw rocks at the bird until it dies with sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children made me sick and has haunted me ever since it simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance the ending the foster parents adopt sooner does not redeem the depiction of animal cruelty why would anyone want their child to see this film
<START> a demented scientist girlfriend is decapitated so he brings her head back to life honest this is the plot of the movie he try's to get her another body he searches through the sleaze area of town for that perfect body for some reason he has ugly looking monster in a closet at his cabin the sleaze style of the movie is laughable no one in the movie can actually act including the head the closet monster is a man with a mask tie on and you can really tell the plot is slow weak and the ending is so badly done watch the mystery science theater 3000 version of this move believe me folks i wouldn't watch this movie on its own
<START> this for lack of a better term movie is lousy where do i start br br cinemaphotography this was perhaps the worst i've seen this year it looked like the camera was being tossed from camera man to camera man maybe they only had one camera it gives you the sensation of being a volleyball br br there are a bunch of scenes haphazardly thrown in with no continuity at all when they did the 'split screen' it was absurd everything was squished flat it looked ridiculous br br the color tones were way off these people need to learn how to balance a camera this 'movie' is poorly made and poorly done br br the plot you got to be kidding if i was an ss agent i'd sue the producers looked like the marks brothers with radios and guns sutherland was in his '24' mode i can see this for free eva longoria would have been better with a little less on and a lot more showing as an action bimbo she wasn't much br br i couldn't see a real plot other than douglas boinking the presidents wife never did say why the mercenaries were trying to kill the pres i just don't see the president of the united states running for his life in the utility tunnels of a building like a rat in a maze p l e a s e br br hollywood is dead this movie is the proof i like 'the big screen' have since i was a kid many more 'movies' like this and i'll quit going whats the matter hollywood made so many chick flicks forget how to make a real movie if i owned a theater i'd start running the old movies the one with real actors good story lines and good cinemaphotography br br this 'movie' is a dog don't waste your time or money on it i rate this 'movie' a zero douglas isn't suited for this role i can over look his age but his just is to much of a wimp to carry this off
<START> still crazy has been compared to the spinal tap since both are comedies about wash up r r groups actually here the similarity ends because still crazy is much better written and acted out whereas spinal tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes beavis and butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison still crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie people who expect spinal tap like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light hearted nature of the movie but i'd take a successful self ironic romp of still crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is spinal tap
<START> this is one of the dumbest films i've ever seen it rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all br br there's not a single good line or character in the whole mess if there was a plot it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes there's nothing good to say so ill say nothing i honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released does somebody somewhere not at some stage think 'oh my god this really is a load of shite' and call it a day its crap like this that has people downloading illegally the trailer looks like a completely different film at least if you have download it you haven't wasted your time or money don't waste your time this is painful
<START> i first saw this movie back in the 1980's and now in 2006 this movie still is one of the best movies i have ever seen i would recommend anyone to look at this movie you will not be sorry it is well acted out so real and never a dull moment the acting is superb and the location makes the movie seem like you are there from the beginning right up to the end this movie is the type that makes you lose your attention the actress does an excellent job of portraying the girl who survived this horrific plane crash in the amazon and it shows how she managed to survive in the amazon all alone it is unbelievable that anyone could survive under such conditions this is why this movie is so appealing the fact that this is a true story makes the movie even more interesting and to think that a young girl could survive from this ordeal is overwhelming i find this movie one that i can watch over and over again and one that i never get tired of this is indeed quite a compliment as i have hundreds of movies i would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best i have ever seen
<START> superb comic farce from paul mazursky richard dreyfuss plays jack noah a fairly successful actor who is on location shooting a film in a fictitious latin american banana republic parador ruled by the fascist alfonse sims who unfortunately has succumbed of a heart attack after indulging in too many local cocktails raul julia plays the oily chief of police who forces the reluctant noah to impersonate the just deceased dictator who noah bears a remarkable resemblance sonia braga plays the dictator's glamorously lusty mistress who gives noah a few lessons in how to 'act' like a dictator jonathan winter's literally rounds off the cast as a cia man in parador posing as a hammock salesman can noah win over the people of parador and hold off the rebels and give the performance of a lifetime without losing his in the process sammy davis jnr has a cameo as himself who amusingly croons the national anthem of parador as well as begin the beguine frog number one fernando rey pops up as a kindly servant charo is also on hand as a busty maid the score by maurice jarre is excellent
<START> i searched out this one after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging clueless 1995 perhaps alicia silverstone's best known effort from early in her film career true crime has kevin dillon which should be helpful in improving most film projects in fact everyone in the cast does a good job the only disappointment i think the movie has for me is an awkward feel to some of the scenes coming from the need to run a quite uncompromising grown up theme as part of what in tone starts out as a schoolgirl adventure br br alicia silverstone is pretty good in this one she carries off well the naive enthusiasm and growing unease that affects mary giordano as she manoeuvres towards the truth behind the serial murders i reckon her characterization of mg has some mileage in it too the inference of the story line is that she goes on to a career in law enforcement it could be really interesting for an older silverstone to revisit giordano at a time of crisis later in the officer's life just a thought br br true crime shows its director in a good light pat verducci also has the writing credit i don't know of any other film work pv has done i can only wonder what happened after such a promising start br br like most productions this one has a largely unknown supporting cast although bill nunn detective jerry guinn is hardly that over the past decade he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances i recall seeing him recently in carriers 1998 a made for tv presentation with a military theme bill nunn played captain arends fans of the classic us tv comedy show who's the boss may also have an interest in carriers because the leading player is judith light remembered with affection by many because of her lengthy involvement with the show br br true crime could easily not have worked but it does ok i think it is an entertaining story worth seeing
<START> while not as bad as his game to movie adaptations this hunk of crud doesn't fare much better br br boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he doesn't make good movies one of these days he'll run out of money and stop inflicting the world with his bombs br br the acting was sub par the dialog sounded like they were reading teleprompters and boll's special little 'touches' were seen throughout the whole thing br br like all uwe boll movies this one just shouldn't exist br br plain and simple br br just like uwe boll himself shouldn't exist
<START> yes mtv there really is a way to market daria what started as a clever teenage angst comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life sitcom now mutated into a how you should deal with your problems charade i used to watch daria all the time and loved it now sitting here after watching the so called movie i can only wonder what the point of this all was daria tells us how to lead out life in college excuse me didn't the point daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it this entire thing reminded me of the scene in reality bites the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time
<START> oh dear lord how on earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone it reeks of cheese from start to finish but it's not even good cheese it's the scummiest moldiest most tasteless cheese there is and i cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually truly enjoyed it yes if you saw it with a load of drunk stoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen i watched it with an up for a few laughs guy having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film's expected crapness we got the crapness plenty of it but not the chuckles it doesn't even qualify as a so bad it's good movie it's just plain bad very very bad here's why look away if you're spoilerphobic the movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death ok i was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was but i think i grasped the 'this guy is a bit of a badass who you don't want to mess with' message behind the ingenious scene oh and a guy witnesses it so we already have our ultra evil bad guy and wussy but cute apparently good guy cue hero big sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish i e hero is immune to bullets everyone else falls over rather clumsily cue first plot hole how the bloody hell did sammy know where this guy was or that he'd watched the murder perhaps this and the answers to all my plot hole related questions was explained in the 2 minutes before i got into the cinema but i doubt it in fact i'm going to stop poking holes in the plot right here lest i turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese so the 'plot' a very generous word to use good guy must get to la evil guy would rather he didn't hero sam stands between the two cue scenery for the next vomit inducing hour the passenger plane as i said no more poking at plot holes i'll just leave it there passenger plane next the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie and what makes it everything it is snakes yay oh pause first we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have hot horny couple see if you can guess how they die dead before any snakes even appear british guy those pesky brits eh cute kids and jo brand for all you americans that's an english comic famous for her size and unattractiveness now that we've met the cast let's watch all of them die except of course the cute kids don't expect anything original it's just snake bites on various and ever increasingly hilarious really not parts of the body use your imagination since the film makers obviously didn't use theirs br br so that's most of the film wrapped up so now for the best bit the ending as expected everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face yep ice cool sammy included but wait we're not all off the plane yet the last guy to get off is good guy but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things clearly this one had been hiding in mr jackson's hair the whole time since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier despite the 200ft constrictor the one that ate that pesky british bugger being unable to so sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop at this point i prayed that the movie was about to make a much needed u turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort but no in a kind of icing on the cake way but with stale cheese remember it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest how anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me but it did well in summing up the film br br actually we're not quite done yet after everyone has sucked face uncle sam with leading actress good guy with tiffany token black guy with token white girl and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia it's time for good guy and hero to get it on in bali nope it wasn't at all exciting the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll yes the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times that's it this is the first time i've ever posted a movie review but i felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography if you like planes snakes samuel l jackson air hostesses bad guys surfing dogs in bags or english people then please please don't see this movie it will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you'll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again go see united 93 instead that was good
<START> any screen adaptation of a john grisham story deserves a mainstream hollywood approach and robert altman is about the last director i would go to for a mainstream take on anything but this southern fried pot boiler is pretty good while it's not among altman's best it certainly isn't among the films he's made that leave you scratching your head and wondering what he was thinking br br altman had tipped his hat to the mystery thriller with noir overtones before in his 1973 film the long goodbye the gingerbread man is nowhere near as good as that film but it holds up fairly well on its own kenneth branagh is a cocky attorney who finds himself framed for murder after he gets involved with a client embeth davidtz who has enlisted his help in protecting her from her cuckoo father robert duvall the film is set in savannah georgia during the approach of a tropical storm which lends the film an oppressive atmosphere that i very much liked the twists and turns toward the film's end become clunkier and clunkier and altman proves himself to be not all that adept at staging shootouts but overall the film is not a bad addition to altman's canon br br also starring robert downey jr daryl hannah tom berenger and famke janssen br br grade b
