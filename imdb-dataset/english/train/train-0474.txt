<START> robert wuhl is teaching a class of film students at new york university in manhattan new york br br he covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer generally known i would like to see much more of this show it is very entertaining mr wuhl uses examples and show and tell to get his points across he explained that the person who actually rode the midnight ride of paul revere was not paul revere henry wadsworth longfellow used revere's name because it sounded better br br i've watched robert wuhl for many years from the time he was doing stand up comedy and all the way through arli on hbo he's a good actor and a good stand up comedian but he's an excellent teacher i highly recommend that you watch an episode of this show it is well worth your time
<START> i have screened this movie several times here at college and every time i show it the number of people watching with me grows exponentially in addition to the virgins anyone i've already shown it to needs to see it again it takes a little while to get into it but by the end the whole room is screaming shouting yelling rewinding scenes repeatedly repeating dialogue and just totally and completely engrossed in the moviegoing experience that is pia zadora in the lonely lady scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed poorly written horribly acted trash is thrown at you in an all out assault that ranks as the campiest thing i own no small statement friends for me nothing compares 2 u pia and i don't suppose i'm the only one who's ever felt this way
<START> this film is shockingly underrated on imdb like so many films this isn't shawshank but it's a reasonably good if predictable dance competition personal growth film if you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 mile for a female step dancer than i think you'll like it br br judging from the imdb ratings my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250 and was vote bombed with many 1s as happens to so many films that aren't about the mob don't have special effects or include non white or non straight characters br br it's an american film but it's not a us film set mostly in toronto the cues are subtle and some audiences may think it's set entirely in the us just because the final competition is in the border city of detroit br br i liked the music i liked the dance but not convinced it's worth 50 000 but what do i know the characters were easy on the eyes br br i do agree the title sucks i don't remember anyone in the film saying those words and it should have an s no it's not a foreign language br br there's not a lot to hate about this film and let's be honest a vote of 1 means you hated it so i can only assume that it's an expression of hate for the kind of people in it and that's sad
<START> disney the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years films like tarzan and the emperor's new groove have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song driven routine of disney's past and into new uncharted territory atlantis is the boldest step yet but we have to remember this is still disney the first ever serious film to come out of disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them in fact it's so serious it makes it into pg territory perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer br br but despite the more mature subject matter this is still a film that disney wanted to draw in the families with not just mature audiences so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of the little mermaid et al br br so what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96 minute movie ultimately this is an action film about atlantis not about the exposition preceding it so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point a to point b so quickly you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of hollywood if you want epic levels of detail in the plot turn to james cameron's titanic both films feature a boat in some manner br br and let's talk about love shall we yes as with a lot of films the lead male one milo thatch a bumbling archaeologist and lead female kida the clichÃ©d atlantian princess are set to fall in love with each other but what i found was not as clichÃ©d as i was expecting by film's end for once the characters touching feeling kissing sequence was far more subdued there's various points in the film where the attraction grows but it's just not in the ballpark of say the little mermaid a good thing br br you may have grasped that this is a rather clichÃ©d film correct you have your leading hero and heroine backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition all being given their moments during the film numerous other characters appear take up the few minutes of screentime then disappear it doesn't take a genius to do the maths Â a 96 minute film with a focus on action and visuals and with a considerable cast has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent so what does it rely on clichÃ©s and lots of them every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before you have the bumbling scientist the attractive princess the square jawed colonel the rich eccentric the maniacal sleazebag the russian femme fatale Â need i go on br br i don't know why this got to anyone Â i found the tongue in cheek nature of this film quite amusing alright this is meant to be a serious flick but do you really expect disney to give up every single trait of their history at least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue and sometimes it even is a little inspired br br but in the end it's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake the cgi animation is truly amazing in places and doesn't dwarf the characters which was a flaw that let the recent titan a e down speaking of characters disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs bringing an anime style to the film infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime much more so than any previous disney outing this resulted in a conflict with fans of the japanese anime nadia for the film's overall similarities with said cartoon series having not seen this anime i can't comment br br with picture there is sound gary rydstrom heads up the sound team and what a soundtrack from the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat james newton howard treats us to a dynamic musical score which compliments the film in every way never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it br br perhaps i missed the point of what the creators intended to me the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride albeit with a more serious tone than any disney film before it if you don't like the clichÃ©d tongue in cheek attitude then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight heck at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other disney efforts cough hercules cough br br this is a positive 10 out of 10 review from someone who was blown away by this film i always suspend my disbelief with any animated film Â after all the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium so sit back enjoy the ride and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film
<START> to make a film straddling the prequels and the real star wars trilogy would tax even a great film maker mr lucas is not that film maker br br to portray the fall of a good man into darkness needs a good actor mr christensen is not that actor br br the first 60 80 minutes are overwhelmingly boring with only a few pockets of yet more light sabre fights but there is a lack of edge because you already know which main characters survive to the original star wars br br count dooku christopher lee has a very fleeting role here and about the best idea is to have jar jar binks silent br br no the film only picks up with the chancellor turning on the jedi and has one great overlong sequence at the lava falls
<START> some people don't like the animation personally i think the animation was quite remarkable given when this movie was done there are lots of older cartoons that i just love my problems with this movie are not the animation but basically the way it was constructed the characters are all just well goofy and for this movie they shouldn't be apparently everyone in lotr has a limping problem for starters just the way they acted in general annoyed me my two sisters and i were laughing through most of this movie i think that if many people had seen this before seeing the newer ones they wouldn't have gone i'm glad i rented this and didn't buy it there are few movies that give me a headache this was one of them however this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen although it ranks up there or down there depending on your view
<START> i bought this dvd after seeing it highly ranked here it's just a short 20 minutes zombie film nothing special about it except for the music perhaps br br don't buy it not even really worth spending 20 minutes to see it only if you're really bored
<START> if it wasn't for the bad dialogues and script i mean the direction was really in touch with it's subject the actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life but in the end the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together i would highly suggest not to watch this unless you're a al pacino enthusiast like i am and will watch everything he is playing in even if the result lately are rather poor this is after s1m0ne a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles
<START> i enjoyed the night listener very much it's one of the better movies of the summer br br robin williams gives one of his best performances in fact the entire cast was very good all played just the right notes for their characters not too much and not too little sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch toni collette is great as the mom and never goes over the top everyone is very believable br br it's a short movie just under an hour and a half i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie br br the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well br br do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads it is not a hitchcockian thriller see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed br br my only complaint with the movie was the ending the director could have left a little more to the audience's imagination but this is a minor quibble
<START> though i saw this movie years ago its impact has never left me stephen rea's depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving his anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable everyone in the cast is amazing from sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts to the troubled citizen x each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers i think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers
<START> well our standards have gone into the toilet the direction was poor the acting was mediocre and the writing was amateurish and those are the good points hopefully there won't be a sequel otherwise i might have to leave the country
<START> william russ is the main character throughout this made for tv movie he left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts but he tries to keep away from his family thats where peter falk colombo comes in playing several different roles to convince him to come home br br the story is average and they actually managed to get a former star peter falk and use him to a fairly nice degree but william russ wasn't truly a star however it appears his acting is still ok br br i found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable in fact the last 20 minutes i could almost dictate word for word before it happened a good movie should never be like that br br overall it was a sub par movie in a letter grading system it would receive a d
<START> positively awful george sanders vehicle where he goes from being a thief to police czar br br while sanders was an excellent character actor he was certainly no leading man and this film proves it br br it is absolutely beyond stupidity gene lockhart did provide some comic relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his gun with tragedy resulting br br sadly george sanders and co star carol landis committed suicide in real life after making a film as deplorable as this it is not shocking br br the usual appealing signe hasso is really nothing here
<START> a friend and i went through a phase some alot of years ago of selecting the crappest horror films in the video shop for an evening's entertainment for some reason i ended up buying this one probably v v cheap br br the cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre there's also a few very amusing scenes among them is a scene where a man's being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects it made me laugh at the time doesn't seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you go br br apart from that it's total crap mind you but probably worth a watch if you like films like chopping mall yes i've seen that too
<START> it breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be its very underrated people forgot what movies are really about nowadays they only think about bum bum movies which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends like transformers movies which are oriented with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline its the kind of a movie what i despite most of course it is fun watching greatly made cgis but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of movies br br i honestly think that performance was excellent especially busy philipps alongside with erika christensen and victor garber whom i respect made this movie an oscar worth emotional performance by busy philipps was astonishing its such a shame we wont see oscar in her hands which she deserves
<START> as a forty something urban explorer photography and longtime fan of the original kolchak night stalker series since my early childhood one aspect that hasn't really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration carl's character undertook during the series he always managed to get himself in to one great abandonment sewer or tunnel after another armed with only his trusty penlight okay so he had some flares in the primal ape episode tunnel and his camera he never carried any other gear to either protect himself or make the exploration easier br br like many here i recently purchased the dvd box set of the two pilot movies and subsequent tv episodes and have been slowly revisiting all the shows and although i remember watching them back in the early 70s when they first aired its been over 30 years passed so many of them seem new all over again campy dated and cheesy but charming and highly entertaining they just don't make stuff like this these days now its all regurgitated spin offs with predictable characters and plots br br thankfully my 16 yr old daughter has been sitting down to watch the episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them she enjoys the genre it gives me hope and faith the series will carry on to new generations of fans for years to come
<START> in my mind the best of the ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time the theme of workers v management with lots of talk of unions and rights perhaps dates the film a bit now as it's no longer a subject discussed all that much but that doesn't stop white suit from being a show stopping classic br br the plot about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil doesn't sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true ealing comedy the fabric repels dirt and can never wear out the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences such as guinness being able to use his indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall the script itself is full of dry wit is he all right yes pity and characterisation is first rate i'm always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well comedies of later eras would adopt a point the camera at the actors and let it roll mentality but the ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations this film is no exception br br of course it's the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance with eyes that convey wonder joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it stratton is a man oblivious to everything except his work such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating but guinness effortlessly makes him likable so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything he's ever worked for joan greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual as are befuddled cecil parker and slimy michael gough everybody gets laughs without even trying to it's comical british understatement at its finest br br the man in the white suit is 81 minutes of sheer brilliance with a great plot great cast sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism absolutely top notch
<START> complete waste of time this movie is not comedy it's not drama it's not romance not even teenage comedy at least story it should be some turn over one end but it's so disappointing when movie has a turn over on end i expect that turn over to make movie even better exp fight club but this turn over makes movie even worse when i watch teenage comedy and i don't do that very often i expect lousy jokes and bunch of nudeness jokes are too lousy and there is no nudity you got only one very good looking i must admit girl and that's that and she's fully dressed whole movie acting is bad like soap series don't waste your time there are porns with better story and acting br br sorry on my bad english
<START> when i spotted that noah wyle and ricky schroder were in the same movie i was like score i admit i was eager to see the movie and i have to say the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way then it went all down hill i didn't expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo they took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story i was appalled that noah was involved in anything of the sort especially his role nobody with a fully functional brain would actually accept all that crap about the vietnam war if anyone really wants to know how communism was like sit down and read a book on it and not one that praises it or is against it just the cold hard facts br br i only watched a few scenes here and there only because i wanted to see ricky's body but that was all that interested me everything else about this movie irritated me
<START> spoilers although none that aren't revealed in the first two minutes of the movie br br robin williams is actually quite good in this as the friendly lonely emotionally stunted loser sy he makes a very human even sympathetic psycho and really disappears into the character no small feat for such a recognizable performer br br too bad the rest of the movie is such a waste the supporting performances and performers wouldn't look out of place in a soft core porno it doesn't help that every character but sy is made of 100 cardboard at times the director actually seems to be trying to frustrate suspense we know from the very first moments a that sy is a complete whack job b that he survives and c that he gets nabbed by the cops at the end so all we're left to ponder is the hows and the whys and the answers provided aren't all that interesting br br the plot is plodding and contrived and features some nonsensical moments for instance the husband berates his wife for her expensive tastes even though she seems to spend all her free time at the local discount superstore about two thirds of the way through sy does something so irredeemably stupid that it makes one wonder how much he actually cares about his grand revenge scheme and the final clichÃ©d explanation of his psychosis right out of peeping tom ' is a terrible copout br br the dialogue is of the absolute worst sort it's not overwritten or awkward or unbelievable or bad in any other way that could be considered fun even for bad movie lovers instead every line is purely hideously functional it's as if the director handed a plot outline to a newspaper copywriter and said hey i need a workable script on this in an hour ' it made me want to scream honestly br br this movie seems to be a throwback to the suburban beware the help thrillers of the eighties and nineties the hand that rocks the cradle ' e g and while it's certainly unpleasant it's never really scary sy's fetishism occasionally makes you feel uncomfortable but on its own that's not enough to make the film work in the end lack of craftsmanship from everyone involved except robin williams sinks this one 3 out of 10
