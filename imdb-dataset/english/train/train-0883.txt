<START> oh my bad clothing worse synth music and the worst david hasselhoff the 80's are back with vengeance in witchery an american italian co production helmed by infamous joe 'd'amato on the production side and short careered director thank heavens for small miracles fabrizio laurenti directing marketed as a kind of sequel to sam raimi's evil dead series in italy that was dubbed la casa in there witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting br br a mix of ghost story possessions and witchcraft the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix ups slow it's progress to expectable ending topped with some serious wtf surprise climax i just love the look on her face surprisingly laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few very few scenes unluckily for him these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively br br the plus sides are experienced when the gore hits the fan this department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80's italo gore when things were made 100 hand made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow i could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over the top ways that obnoxious characters and actors got mangled and misused one by one i only felt sorry for linda blair who apparently haven't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl woman role ever in his career or so it looks like when checking out his filmography br br well folks not much more to tell and even less to tell home about don't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this and probably you'll experience at least some mild fun it also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80's euro gore horror and speaking of hearts every movie that has david hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors must have it's one on the right place br br this is my truth what is yours
<START> a wonderful early musical film from rene clair as fun and witty as his silent the italian straw hat using sound in a expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects clair influenced early musicals in america the opera scene from a night at the opera is strongly influenced by le million for example should but won't be seen by all cinephiles and the dvd from criterion is exactly as good as you'd expect there's not a ton of extras but most dvd extras i've seen are useless fluff and the clair interview on disc is one i hadn't ever seen get it while it's still around
<START> i just saw this movie mainly because brady corbet is in it and i must say that i was not pleased br br of course the computer graphics were amazing but the story line needed a little touch up also i think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood as well if it were rated pg 13 br br that would definitely attract more people to see it teens what would also attract more teens particularly teen girls would be a large close up of brady corbet on the thunderbirds poster br br even though the movie had it's down points i still saw it and thought it was okay
<START> we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books while not particularly accurate adaptations these movies were nonetheless excellent films some great examples are the harry potter series the lord of the rings trilogy and to a lesser extent almost every disney film ever made however i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine l'engle's fan base it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting acting special effects and ultimately respect for the audience mind you i'm not trying to be mean on the contrary i went into this affair with an open mind i figured that a made for t v movie would make up for its lack of razzle dazzle in its script after all the star wars spin off ewoks was decent if a little silly come to think of it the original star wars was made on a lunch money budget and look where it took george lucas however from the first scene onward disappointment started enveloping me as if i'd gotten too close to the black thing while tessering br br the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of 1997 a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic mrs whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard star trek first contact and radio as our favorite star turned mentor the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow that's right a crow moreover the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight year old the majestic half man half horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle had i been five this would have psychologically traumatized me for life the worst part is the fact that when it spoke it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single unmoving cheek thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than e t br br having gotten the most painful part out of the way i must go on to the tear inducing one the characters the acting and the story i personally had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films plain hair glasses and a figure most supermodels would find laughable she was always a slightly anxious humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua in the film she is an unpleasant know it all for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever in fact she makes me feel sorry for poor mr jenkins her school principal who continuously has to deal with her calvin the kind intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomeÂa jock the irony is horrible as for the memorable happy medium they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is above gender and likes to look at funny things such as girls falling off of swings the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace mrs whatsit and the man with red eyes nicknamed the dude with red eyes due to his complete reinvention as a character br br the story is a mess a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban which didn't do a good job of retelling the story found in the book yet kept the sole of the original work here the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with hades down in the underworld apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed as the dark lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen the flat nosed wookies of ixchel who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks tear the spine up as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earth like camazotz was the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil br br i am very sorry that this film exists i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad it's the way the characters are written that ruins it a wrinkle in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence kasdan directed by george lucas or steven spielberg enhanced at industrial light and magic scored by john williams given its sound at skywalker sound edited by thx and marketed by twentieth century fox in its current state the film is unworthy to be shown to self respecting people even madeleine l'engle thought it was bad the book was good the film was bad and mrs whatsit was ugly br br score 0 1 10 if i could br br pros br br they got the names right br br cons br br it had horrible problems with the cliffs notes level of adaptation script acting and special effects not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book oh and the main cover poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle some might say that this symbolizes high adventure i say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn't even bother to photoshop meg's arm on properly
<START> it could have been a marvelous story based on the ancient races of cat people but it wasn't br br this work could have been just that marvelous and replete with mythological references which kept my fascination fueled the lead characters charles brady played by brian krause and his mother mary played by alice krige were shallowly done had no depth of personality and were hardly likable or drawing not even mÃ¤dchen amick who played tanya robertson 's character fit into that description br br however as i've said many times before when you adapt a stephen king novel for tv you simply must take into account the fact that his books aren't written for tv and his screenplay talent sadly lacks the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist br br this is another botched attempt to take the magick of stephen king writing whether that is of his novels or an original screenplay to simply cut and paste his work onto the small screen his novels get completely bastardized in the process and all you end up creating is a nice movie nothing less but certainly nothing more his screenplays are hit and miss unfortunately this screenplay translation was a miss br br sorry sorry sorry movie br br this movie gets a 1 0 10 from br br the fiend
<START> rosenstrasse is more an intimate film than one of epic proportions which could have kept away many film goers looking for a pianist similar plot fortunately von trotta a good screenwriter opts for a feminist peep to an era too much illustrated on its colorful exterior but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of ordinary aryan german rather from a jewish standpoint rosentrasse finds its strength in these unsung burdens of people trapped within historical circumstances of which they emerge as victims the pace of the film is introspective poignantly slow meditative besides the characters are so vivid while transitions between generations and the passing of time has been deftly crafted rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece and some narrative flaws are well discerned another fault lies on a trivial cinematography unable to capture the intensity of the internal drama lived by the characters nevertheless this film is worth seeing finally rosenstrasse is part of the last trend in german films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmarish past trend that includes such excellent films as nowhere in africa and recently the controversial downfall i would recommend this film to those who know how to read beyond the images
<START> a cry in the dark is a masterful piece of cinema haunting and incredibly though provoking the true story of lindy chamberland who in 1980 witnessed a horrific sight seeing her 3 month old baby being brutally taken from their family's tent while camping on the austrailian outback azaria the baby was never seen again and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy as she always does but the one thing that helps a cry in the dark never fall flat is the brilliant direction a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case tears are brought to the eyes the concept is nothing less then terrifying and afterwards you are left haunted but also inspired
<START> there is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by reese witherspoon that her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed robert mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work every frame of the man in the moon is evidence of film making at its best
<START> if you ever have the chance to see sandra bernhard live in person you better move on it sweetie i saw her last year in los angeles at the opening of her everything bad and beautiful tour and i still can't believe that i was in the first row and lucky enough to experience such a phenomenal show she is now in new york with the show and it coincides with the release of her groundbreaking stunner without you i'm nothing we have lost richard pryor lenny bruce nina simone but sandra is still with us patti smith is missing in action but not sandra barbara streisand continues to peep her head out once in awhile but sandra more than makes up for where babs leaves off okay i want it known ms bernhard is a little of these influential entertainers and more i really wanted to push this film because of its truth honesty humor eclectic songs ranging from laura nyro sylvester nina simone prince and a script that defines the decadence joy sadness ups and downs of the 70's and 80's it is my opinion that many and i mean many comics have lifted okay outright stolen so much from this show if not from sandra herself i won't name names but come on people you and i know who they are see the thing is bernhard plays by her own rules this movie shows as does her live performances that she is a performer who has stayed true to the old school of show business as well as pushing forward her performances are reminiscent of smoky jazz clubs during the time of miles davis coltrane monk 70's tv shows intimate cabaret acts and concerts that are reminiscent of everyone from judy garland to joan jett most comedians couldn't even touch where sandra is coming from or going to so here i was a year ago watching sandra at the silent movie theater in total awe and joy i wanted to meet her after the show give her something that meant something to me that hopefully would mean something to her but i listen to my copy of giving til it hurts and just thank her in a prayer of sorts for making me laugh making me think making me feel you can't deny this lady's presence and you certainly cannot deny the talent that just rushes from the stage she's still here damn it even after the release of without you i'm nothing some 15 years ago and she looks great by the way i know this firsthand walking from the theater one audience member said to another she is so funny and she still looks incredible if you can't experience her live yet please see this movie as for me i do hope that sandra will see this you've meant a heck of a lot to me gotten me through some tough crazy times if you can send me an email please do if not knowing that you are still kicking it out and will continue to do so is enough for me come on people give it up for the lady
<START> i saw this movie when mystery science theater ran it in 1993 it is the worst thing i've ever seen so bad in fact that by sheer freakiness this movie must get a ten rating because it has to be seen to be believed br br whoever wrote this script with children in mind should be beaten i mean really the devil vs santa visions of hell creepy laughing wind up reindeer forced child labor with racial stereotypes it ain't sesame street that's for sure as crow exclaims during the mst3k showing this is good ol' fashioned nightmare fuel br br there's plenty of weird innuendo and screwed up theology merlin presumably the arthurian merlin hangs out with santa in his crazy castle in the clouds i e heaven santa talks about baby jesus and sends letters to mr stork for children who ask for siblings there are symbols around the castle that either look like pentagrams or raf stars br br my best friend and i have watch it every year since 1993 and we subject anybody we can hold down for 2 hours to watch it with us
<START> this is not a good film the acting is remarkably stiff and unconvincing the film doesn't seem to know whether it is going for a real horror approach or to go down the camp and kitsch route i never saw the first film but this one doesn't stand up on its own merits there are several unconvincing plot twists and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the lead female vampire not worth the effort of watching
<START> anyone who visited drive ins in the 1950s 60s and 70s must have seen a film or two by american international pictures a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films wherever movie goers ventured aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles in the 50s came horror movies like 'voodoo woman' and 'the undead ' in the 60s were frankie avalon annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like 'the glory stompers ' and into the 70s aip churned out grindhouse level trash like 'cannibal girls' and 'sugar hill ' br br 'dillinger ' released in 1973 is one of the more 'highbrow' aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive in film making it is one of those uneven over the top flicks that satisfied the masses' thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned on the whole 'dillinger' is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact 'dillinger' was a fair effort by screenwriter director john milius 'magnum force' but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career br br the 109 minute 'dillinger' epic for aip's scope follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber john dillinger warren oates pretty boy floyd steve kanaly and psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson taking along homer van meter harry dean stanton and harry pierpont geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with billie frechette michelle phillips a prostitute of french and indian extraction while taking place over several months in 1933 4 'dillinger' is basically a chase film with purvis's entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hoover br br 'dillinger' has a documentary feel listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also sprinkles around black and white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts the film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace the action scenes are dillinger's strongpoint edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives this film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life br br this film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isn't there john milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes mostly blood filled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including 1967's 'bonnie and clyde ' but we simply don't get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling all too often the film takes on a shoot 'em up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail br br aside from this the picture's main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that 'dillinger' is just a film it's films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as milius's screenplay and the film's documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why milius couldn't have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them br br warren oates's performance as dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger than life image in the american press however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it's really too bad that milius's screenplay didn't flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a cold blooded killer other than the stereotype of an easy going girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with kanaly dreyfuss stanton lewis and a briefly appearing cloris leachman are acceptable for such talent br br as a piece of 1970s exploitation 'dillinger' appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where i picked up mgm's dvd release for 4 99 the film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drive in flicks with subtitles in french and spanish dillinger's theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive in enthusiasts the film doesn't really call for much else in way of supplementary material for fans of the genre it's certainly worth checking out br br out of 4 br br roving reviewer www geocities com paul johnr
<START> man some of you people have got to chill this movie was artistic genius instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality why can't you understand that it is a work of fiction a story entertainment for god's sake no pun intended it seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie critics and they're not doing to well i'm so impressed by the movie and bill paxton's job at directing that i'm going to contact him personally to tell him ya know if you weren't trying to analyze the heck out of the possibility of the story line you might just enjoy the film me and all of my friends did
<START> visually cluttered plot less incredibly mind numbing rubbish not even close to greenaway's better work avoid at all costs br br the overlapping 'split screen' effects do nothing more than confuse the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the 'artistic' composing of images is pretentious in the extreme br br there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film even the nudity is incredibly unerotic which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring br br plus how anyone can say that the acting of ewen macgregor is brilliant is beyond me he showed more ability in the star wars series and that's saying something br br i've not been so unimpressed with a film since i saw 'darby o'gill and the little people'
<START> you don't need to read this review br br an earlier review by pninson of seattle has already identified all the main shortcomings of this production i can only amplify its basic arguments br br bleak house was a relatively late dickens novel and is much darker than his earlier work this is taken too literally by the director ross devenish who piles on the gloom and fog too much when ada rick and esther appear half an hour into the opening episode it is a relief just to be in daylight for the first time in some of the murkier scenes it was hard to see what was actually on my tv screen i watched the whole thing in one day starting in mid afternoon as daylight faded this became less of an issue but i have a pretty good tv and i have never encountered this problem before at any time of day br br the pacing is very deliberate i e slow i am sure this was intensional but it is overdone there are numerous shots of people trudging though the muck and gloom of victorian london that are held longer than is necessary to establish the mood and atmosphere a good editor could probably take several minutes out of each fifty minute episode without losing a line of dialogue just by trimming each of these scenes slightly br br i don't want to overstate these two problems you soon adjust to the look and pace of this production the more important issue is that it doesn't always tell the story very effectively earlier dickens novels are as long as bleak house but are not nearly so intricately plotted for example i recently re read nicholas nickleby because i was intrigued to see how douglas mcgrath crammed an 800 page book into his two hour movie the answer is simple the book is full of padding mcgrath cut great swathes of the novel while still retaining all the essential story elements this would not be possible with bleak house br br this production needs its seven hours probably it needs even longer because many elements of its convoluted plot are not sufficiently clear or as well handled as they need to be a few random examples will illustrate the problems br br the maid rosa appears from nowhere with no background so lady dedlock's attachment to her is largely unmotivated br br sergeant george's acquiescence in tulkinhorn's demand for a sample of horton's handwriting is somewhat fudged br br it is not made clear enough that esther is actually in love with woodcourt when she agrees to marry john jarndyce neither is it clear that they have agreed not to announce their engagement or why br br ada and rick's secret marriage is omitted in one episode they are merely lovers in the next people are suddenly referring to them as husband and wife br br mrs rouncewell is only introduced at a late stage in the story and sargeant george's estrangement from his family is left unexplained as is the means by which she is discovered br br tulkinhorn's dedication to maintaining the honour and respectability of the dedlock family is understated so his motive for persecuting lady dedlock is more obscure than it need be br br the involvement of the brick makers with both tom and later lady dedlock is somewhat opaque br br it is not obvious that guppy renews his offer to esther because her smallpox scars have all but vanished br br this is only a selection there are others they are not major problems and the main thrust of the story is clear enough nonetheless they are minor irritations that detract from its power you shouldn't have to puzzle over little plot points however there are more important structural problems that do weaken the story in its later stages br br the whole business of tulkinhorn's murder is somewhat thrown away bucket immediately pinpoints hortense as a suspect which undermines the suspense of sergeant george's predicament and the importance of finding mrs rouncewell it also diminishes the impact of the sub plot in which suspicion is thrown on lady dedlock and weakens the scene in which hortense is unmasked in front of sir lester br br a more serious problem is that the murder its investigation and the subsequent search for lady dedlock dominate the story for over an hour during which time we completely lose sight of the other main plot strand the legal case and its effect on rick his failing finances his gouging by vholes and skimpole ada's despair his declining health and so on are all put on hold for an entire episode this may be how dickens wrote the book i haven't read it for years but a good screenplay should keep the different plot strands moving forward together br br finally smallweed's role in the story is so diminished that he is almost superfluous his discovery of the new will that triggers the final phase of the story is also thrown away it happens off screen br br despite all of this it is still a very good production many of the performances are outstanding individual scenes are beautifully realised its accumulating sense of tragedy is very powerful i would still be recommending it as a superb adaptation of a great book had it not been for the 2005 production in fact i probably wouldn't be fully aware of its defects if i hadn't seen how andrew davies did it better i have been critical of davies's jane austen adaptations but i have to admit that he really knows how to tame dickens's sprawling books br br this is an impressive and gripping drama and well worth seven hours of anybody's time nonetheless its probable fate is to be viewed mainly as a cross reference to the near definitive 2005 version
<START> how can this movie have a 5 5 this movie was a piece of skunk s t first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw charlie was so retarded because in the very beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden hut that happened to be about oh 1 quarter of an inch thick that really cheap as flimsy piece of wood and he did not even think he could cut threw it second the person who did the set sucks as at supplying things for them to build with the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this t v show bottom line do not waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of s t they call a movie br br rating 0 3
<START> after viewing the film i was truly shocked to see such a high rating on imdb br br 'the fantastic mr fox' is an adaption of a beloved children's classic portraying the story of the smooth slick protagonist mr fox or 'foxy' as he attempts one 'last' heist to steal from the dreaded boggins bunce and bean that's right one short one fat one lean or however it goes br br i don't quite know where to start with my criticism br br well i'm in my late teens and was never a fan of roald dahl but i like his material well enough having read a few of his books as a child and seen matilda and charlie and the chocolate factory over and over again this film however struggles for an audience is it aimed at children adults i'm still unsure many of the 'jokes' would bore a child especially as mr fox visits a lawyer for example or complains about being poor also an audience of i'm assuming children is expected to sympathise with a character who steals and kills chickens i'm all for the food chain but you practically see mr fox biting down on their necks surely that's a bit much and also the plot well it's kind of boring i stayed only with the hope of it getting better but instead i just got more and more annoyed at mr fox and his son ash for making stupid decisions br br the humour meanwhile falls flat i laughed only once or twice even though i specifically recognised attempts at jokes i think part of it is that the voice acting is so incredibly flat and monotoned the voice actors have no sense of comic timing instead aiming for the subtlety of humour that only works with certain mediums george clooney aims to portray mr fox as charming and sleek but his voice has no character meryl streep shows no emotion i didn't even realise bill murray had a role until the end credits and ash twelve years old in fox years sounds like he's about 30 br br i love animation particularly stop motion but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit characters are tall spindly and lacking any warmth of design they move with very little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange there is also a distinctive 'mixed medium' feel as 2d components are added in sporadically and unsuccessfully characters look straight at the camera and talked it was very awkward there was one or two moments when kylie looked straight at the camera didn't move and had swirls on his eyeballs it actually freaked me out br br fantastic mr fox had so much potential lots of people still seem to like it look at the reviews maybe it just wasn't for me
<START> i caught this movie by accident on cable in the middle of it and had to rent it to see it's entirety and i'm glad i did i was immediately drawn by the storyline and cared about the girls involved naive high school graduates best friends since childhood take a high school trip and are taken in by a con man named nick who get them into serious trouble they are used as sacrificial mules in a heroin smuggling ring taken in to custody the girls learn to cope with their incarceration while trying to find a way out of their trouble everything that they try to help themselves falls short when the thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings and the girls end up in more trouble and lose the trust of their american lawyer yankee hank hank gives up trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by alice claire dane however the thai native wife of hank smells a rat in the case and does some further foot work of investigation and finds out the girls really were victimized the end of the movie when alice does a selfless act to save darlene beckinsale had me in tears i really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it
<START> i've been a fan of all things bill maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting of course i am catholic come from a well educated family and go to church of my own volition which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of bill's opinions br br bill's problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative he's correct to document the sociological aspects of it i e one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion or more accurately by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of god but that said he never looks at its positive side quite frankly i think that hell would freeze over before bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of calcutta where mother theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor she's dead now of course but he could easily visit the jesuit priest in east la who runs homeboy industries which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills get their tattoos removed and to become responsible members of society or he could visit usc's institute for advanced catholic studies which has brought together some of the world's finest theologians diplomats and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world's poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world's people who live on less than 1 a day of course he won't do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion and it's so much easier to continue to make snide superficial jokes br br that fits into the other large problem with bill's movie which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is in this movie you have maher the cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational christian truck stop service in a night club with a dutch guy who smokes pot all the time with the minister of a storefront church in miami who claims to be the reincarnation of christ and with an actor playing jesus at a holy land theme park br br what you won't see in bill's film beyond some superficial speculation alongside a ph d in grand central station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like notre dame byu or wheaton college who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter you won't see any serious discussion of any of the writings of c s lewis g k chesterton or any papal encyclicals and of course you also won't find any discussion whatsoever of any of the non abrahamic judaism christianity and islam faiths whatsoever all you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending snobby elitist from the west side of la who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gut level understanding whatsoever of how the other half of america that elected george w bush twice lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it br br i get a lot of what bill's saying but for someone possessing his intellect and influence this film was nothing less than pathetic anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the teletubbies
<START> it is of course very nice to see improvements on turkish movie industry however i would have expected something more creative from togan gokbakar starting from the script which i believe it was not a wise written one as some may think especially the cheesiness of the dialogs which were putting the audience in a position that as if they were not smart enough to understand the situations which most of the times makes the movie unbearable it also has an obvious ending you can easily guess the murderer from the beginning the weakest part of the scenario is that the impossibility of seriously mentally ill patients to act like normal people like professionals right away did they ever search for the possibility of patients who are on heavy medicals to act like professionals and use all the medical terms that even normal people cannot use also in the scene where staff was searching for the most dangerous patient with out any weapon to protect themselves was another weird point of the film and that scene was so suitable for dikkat sahan cikabilir title those are not the only weak parts of the movie there were also a lot of preciosities in the film the depiction of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy from hannibal also appearance of togan in the very end is obviously the worst mistake that he could have done in his first movie the fuss about the greatness of the movie and the interviews that actor's gave just made people to be curious and force them to see it gen is a total disappointment i would have wonder if sahan was not this famous would togan be able to shoot this movie with this much of budget amount i hope togan would realize that it is not fashionable to play in a role as a director as he said in an interview it was hitchcock who did it wisely and night shyamalan continued it successfully he should be aware of the fact that he is not hitchcock nor shyamalan yet hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this big industry
