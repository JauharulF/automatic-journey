<START> though this movie is cheesiness at its best it is pulled off perfectly this movie without a doubt has to be considered a modern classic there are basically two kinds of movies i like movies with depth chick flicks if you must i blame my wife for this and mindless comedies where i can sit back and relax this movie is a perfect example of the latter br br a friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release considering me to somewhat shallow he said to me you've got to see this movie it's just your type of movie foregoing the insult i started watching i know they mentioned the ramones a million times but when you actually see them i said hey it is the ramones my friend replied i don't know they were a real band i had my moment of glory br br this movie though now somewhat dated is a must see for ramones fans or anyone else for that matter
<START> i don't see how you can say that freddy's nightmares is cheesy and a rip off you obviously don't know good tv when you see it the episodes are packed with drama and blood freddy is creative in the way he kills people i love freddy's nightmares and i hope to get all 44 episodes on dvd the best episodes are saturday night special school daze and love stinks if you think this series sucked then you're entitled to your opinion but remember it's only your opinion and it means nothing freddy's nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and you'll come to accept that fact soon enough if you don't like it then don't watch it but don't deny it's brilliance
<START> i really liked the movie i remember reading it several times as a kid and was glad to see a movie had been made about the book br br i was kid sitting for a boy and a girl ages 11 and 8 and had to talk the girl in to seeing the movie but happily at the end she was glad she saw it and even said that she wanted to buy it on dvd as soon as it came out br br there were some great laugh out loud moments and the movie was not as gross as i expected it would be tho it did rank pretty high up there on the gross o meter br br the only thing i cannot figure out is why they had to have the dilly line in there that was done by woody in reference to his private part that to me was the only shocker moment and you could hear the adults in the audience audibly gasp at that moment in the movie i have no clue why that was put in the movie it added nothing to the actual movie except for that shock gasp factor other than that a pretty good movie nice to see the pepsi girl all grown up
<START> in the glory days of the 90s god rest its soul you could turn on the great comedy central at any hour of the day and see the greatest sketch comedy show of all time saturday night live whpat a glorious show that was whether it was the original not ready for primetime players or the second golden age of snl featuring the greats chris farley adam sandler david spade and then it all went to hell i was first exposed to madtv about a year and a half ago and i think i must've passed out from shock how could a show so terrible prevail for so long there are so many horrible flaws i suppose i'll start with the writing the writing for most part is terrible it is nothing more than kindergarten bathroom humor the cast for the most part is talentless there are a few sketches i have enjoyed such as some of ms swan and stuart and there are a few talents on the show such as the magnificent alex borstein phil lamarr is a talented actor just not as a comedian although there a few sparse ha ha moments they are not enough to redeem this endless line of horrible drivel populated by babbling idiots miss this one
<START> frankly i'm rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to steven smith i wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering have they all been written by his pals the action clunks along the music is irritating and over used the script is simply dire and the actors with the exception of the gardener mediocre at best i do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying it's brilliant when it's not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i e continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture yes it's his first film low budget etc i get it but it's also out there for members of the public to purchase and it's just not up to scratch
<START> i initially bought this dvd because it had srk and aishwarya rai on the cover and i thought hey another film starring aishu and shah rukh little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just 15 minutes shakti is a film about a mother's love and endurance it's a film about transformations ignorance coming of age stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie it's actually a dream sequence that occurs while srk's drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day dressed scantily and begins to seduce him the title of the song is 'ishq kamina' loosely translated as love's a bitch and it is just plain smoking hot don't miss it
<START> as for many on here i can't help but praise the cast and crew who developed talespin and others they made throughout my childhood i as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters br br to class this work of art as a cartoon could never do talespin justice in fact it's an insult to class it as a cartoon talespin is an animation and nothing less it is evidently the greatest work of genius to be produced at disney to date when disney pulled it from the air little did they realise what they did and i'm sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since br br i'll take a moment to explain from the first which is ducktales to the last which i think is darkwing duck disney has been plagued with failures due to political correctness and have taken a quantum leap backwards since they prefer quantity over quality now not to mention the room full of monkey's for the story's i couldn't have my children watching the mind numbing cartoons they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer simpson some time in the future and 50 of the blame would be on me for permitting them to watch it i couldn't let that happen which is why i have all of the shows from the late 80's to the mid 90's on a harddrive so one day my children couldn't be corrupted by the cartoon crap of today and to savour the last piece of childhood i have and to hold on to and i owe that all to talespin br br talespin to me is without a doubt the best animation ever produced in the world on account of it's depth charm wit compassion emotion and lack of truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today do you see any of that content in say ed edd and eddie or anything else you can think of the rubbish produced today can be likened to some 3 year old's undecipherable hyroglyph depicting a picasso br br the next time you watch an episode of talespin take a look at the woodgrain on any wooden object or building such as higher for hire and salivate over the quality of workmanship and effort put into this animation even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again the buildings look true to the art deco movement which was popular in the time period depicted even the vehicles are true to life ok not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it evened it all out by the end of the episode and you'd probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detail br br the one thing i love about this is what i like to call the deliberate mistakes or intended mistakes in each episode and some have two for example in sheepskin deep where rebecca say's you're up to something baloo and baloo replies who me i'm as innocent as a schoolboy take a look into rebecca's eyes i won't spoil the rest of the baloopers but just keep an eye out next time br br everyone elses comment's are bang on and 100 correct i have nothing else to add that others haven't said already on here disney wake up and smell the coffee you have been asleep for over a decade stop producing rubbish and bring back quality into animations and stop producing cartoons we have seen the proof of what you can do and we want it back as rapidly as possible
<START> if in the 90's you're adapting a book written in the 50's set the bloody thing in the 50's and not the '90's see 40 year old mores and values tend not to play as well or ring as true that far down the road it's a simple rule that hollywood habitually keeps violating and that's the problem with this film it should have been set in the era it was written in you'd think that would be a no brainer but nooo i'd elaborate but bmacv's comment spells it out quite well i'll limit my commentary to rachel ward she looks like she dieted her ass completely out of existence for this role as a result she looks like a crack ho' on chemotherapy and is about as sexy as a gay leather couch in drag i found her i could die at any moment look quite disconcerting and it greatly detracted from her supposed hotness and the sexual tension the film intended to create other than that the film was quite good a 7 out of 10
<START> the christmas secret was touted as a wonderful film but i was truly disappointed they even sold vhs and dvd copies of the film when it was over which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project as a screen actor myself i felt most of the performances were phoned in although beau bridges as nick did have a moment or two if i were richard thomas i would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume it was an embarrassment i had been a fan since his waltons days but have found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent work so poor was this offering br br in defence of the actors the directing was stilted mechanical and thoroughly amateurish br br i hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic i turned the movie on because it had a good cast and i was prepared to enjoy the film however i would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back even though it was on t v
<START> i am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has haven't said that friends was at best an 'average' sitcom and not as great as others have made out let's face it if it wasn't for the casting of courtney cox arquette david schwimmer matthew perry lisa kudrow jennifer aniston and matt le blanc then who knows whether this show would've lasted as long as it has done i very much doubt that although as the series progressed friends got more progressively predictable lame and boring that i couldn't care less about the characters of whom are the most overrated in tv history or of their plight nor of who was sleeping with whom and it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny and even when it had all these a list hollywood actors from the movie world i still didn't bother to tune in the writing in friends became stale that i lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending well it was predictable to say the least br br what was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good the show should've came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries in truth as much as the series waned it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves not the other way round br br when it ended in 2004 i was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom now there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our tv screens very soon and yet i for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever
<START> this is one of the worst films ever i like cheesy movies but this is simply awful where are the images in the film that are on the box i think more money was spent on the dvd box illustrations than on the entire film br br why would a company release a dvd that the cover is so misleading i feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store i have no one to blame except myself i want my money and time back br br do not watch this movie br br even if curiosity is motivating you stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead it will be much more enjoyable you have been warned
<START> first let me say that before sunrise like all movies is not a movie for all tastes it appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people for me like most folks here before sunrise struck a deep chord in me i was truly stunned moved inspired by it this is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing it creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine it is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings i got from it br br the movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other it is very intelligent and inspiring not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of jesse and celine's discussions but rather the little nuances the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other it captures an honest romantic yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime viennese milieu it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world and what happens after that night is open for debate but i never doubt that they won't each other again br br the facile comments by rockythebear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie br br see it and it may change your way of life
<START> attention spoilers br br first of all let me say that rob roy is one of the best films of the 90's it was an amazing achievement for all those involved especially the acting of liam neeson jessica lange john hurt brian cox and tim roth michael canton jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves but alas br br it constantly and unfairly gets compared to braveheart these are two entirely different films probably only similar in the fact that they are both about scots in historical scotland yet this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that braveheart is a better film than rob roy i like braveheart a lot but the idea of comparing it to rob roy is a little insulting to me to put quite simply i love braveheart but it is a pale shadow to how much i love rob roy here are my particular reasons br br rob roy is about real people br br let's face it the william wallace in braveheart is not a real person he's a legend a martyr a larger than life figurehead because of this depiction he is also a perfect person never doing wrong and basically showing his scot countrymen to the promised land when he finally does fail it is not to his fault like jesus he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most he even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much br br the depiction of wallace is very well done and effective but it really doesn't inspire or intrigue me i find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection that is why the last temptation of christ is a better film than king of kings and that is also one of the reasons why i think rob roy is better than braveheart rob roy may be heroic and brave but he is far from perfect he makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones now sure not bearing false claim against the duke of argyll was an act of nobility and courage but it was also an act of egoism and self centeredness let us not forget that the kinfolk that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act but rob did the best he could and that was all you could ask of him br br rob's wife mary is also a normal ambigious person let us start though with how she looks in this film sure she's beautiful but she doesn't wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show compare this with the two loves or one depending on your point of view of william wallace in braveheart now these two ladies are hot but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time especially the lay persons maybe not a fair comparison but just another example of how rob roy's attempts for accuracy are far more effective br br throughout rob roy mary has to live with her vicious rape by the dastardly carrion cunningham she feels compelled to tell rob of her struggle but doesn't because she knows that rob must seek revenge for her rape such revenge would surely mean the death of rob and mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice br br the villains in rob roy are equally as compelling although the enemies in braveheart are well written they are hardly original robert the bruce a man both brave and cowardly is plagued by moral decisions that are all to familar in the fictional realm should he take his claim as the king of scotland or should he betray wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name bruce is the most ambigious character in braveheart but from brutus in julius ceasar to fredo in the godfather part ii these types of characters are hardly original longshanks although a compelling villain in his own right is very one dimensional he is the epidemy of evil and his tyrant ways stand in direct contrast to wallace's heroism br br rob roy has three villains that are wonderful in their chicanery first of all let's start with marquis of montrose he is a man who is so obsessed with his self image that he's willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it see to it that i am not mocked are his favorite words to his factor he is a man obsessed with power upset that a man of great noble bearing as the duke of argyll can be considered of greater providency then him he is shamefully self obsessed and insecure he is an evil aristocrat but in ways that make him unique br br cunningham and callarn are the conspirators in rob roy and are also roy's direct assailants callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical he will do anything to maintain the good will of the marquis which includes backstabbing and trickery cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the marquis he needs a father little does he know that the marquis is his real father therefore when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from callarn he grabs it without even questioning it he is very much like the evil of modern man so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others br br many have criticized tim roth's performance in this film as overacting hogwash i say it is clear that cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film in a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for amusement is cunningham too much of an unbelievable character we live in a society where people seem to have decreased the value of human life rob roy simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decreased value has changed it is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion rob roy and mary give us hope that goodness will prevail but snakes will always exist in our world br br another character that i find fascinating is the duke of argyll he is a true nobleman and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the marquis he appreciates the bravery of rob roy and mary and has a direct vexation for the marquis and his factor he gives the world hope for the people of power hopefully people like the marquis are an exception and not the rule br br the final duel in rob roy is more exciting then 10 of the battle scenes in braveheart br br one thing i get tired of is people telling me that braveheart is a better film because of the battle scenes first of all battle scenes are hardly original from spartacus to gladiator hollywood has had a long tradition of historical european battle scenes braveheart has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film but they suffer from one important problem these battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom br br now don't get me wrong duels are hardly original either in fact there are probably 10 times as many films with duels as there are with battle scenes but the context of the duel between cunningham and rob roy is a beauty to behold it is one of the greatest scenes in film history let me explain why br br first of all the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly cunningham is effette and dangerous rob roy is strong and courageous cunningham uses a fencing sword while rob uses a broadsword cunningham fights with quick tricky movements while roy's fighting style is more obvious br br the whole film from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half is leading up to this moment it is powerful stuff and it is clear that rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world when rob finally gets the upper hand literally and figuratively it is one of the greatest moments in film history rob wins because he has more to live for and his honor is more powerful than 10 cunningham's the use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get disemboweled just so he can yell freedom but hey maybe that's just me br br rob roy is more realistic than braveheart br br i don't know that people in the aristocracy or scotsmen talked like the people in rob roy but i do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns i feel that many people are bored by rob roy simply because they can't understand what the characters are saying if this is the case then read some shakesphere or put on the close captioning rob roy is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90's many of the dialogue in this film is clever but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it br br by contrast the dialogue in braveheart is hardly very interesting of course what do you expect when the main character is a scotsman played by an australian this is a legend and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times this film takes place several centuries before rob roy and yet they talk like the people today thus the reason that many people like it better audiences today have become increasingly lazy and they don't want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex therefore as with many epic films they expect to see the villians speak a recognizable english accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far away from our american language sure it is clear that the wallace is scotish but other than sounding like scotty from star trek and a couple of aye s for acknowledgement the scots in this film fit into the hollywood tradition of how we believe scots should sound br br so do these descriptions prove that rob roy is a better film than braveheart hardly but if it proves one thing it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that braveheart is a better film than rob roy to put simply rob roy is a film that has themes that are very apropos in today's world braveheart is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic you can make a decision on what you think is better br br grade a score 9
<START> also known in a different form as house of exorcism this messy br br little film takes itself so seriously as to kill any entertainment value br br whatsoever br br the spare plot involves european tourist elke sommer who has a br br chance run in with telly savalas who looks just like the devil she br br saw on a fresco in the square sommer is given a ride to a br br mysterious house in the country where savalas happens to be br br butler there she is mistaken for a long dead woman and the real br br soap opera theatrics begin the house's blind matriarch's br br husband had an affair with the dead woman who was the br br matriarch's son's fiancee the couple who gave sommer the ride br br well the woman is giving the chauffeur uh back seat driving br br lessons and the husband knows and does not care eventually br br most of the cast is killed sommer is drugged and raped br br escapes and the viewer is taken to a climax on board an empty br br airplane which must have resembled the empty theaters this br br thing played in br br the alternate version of this house of exorcism has scenes br br added involving a priest br br the vhs copy of this from elite entertainment is crystal clear and br br letterboxed there are extras after the end credits deleted sex br br and gore scenes br br mario bava's direction is fast and furious but his screenplay is br br awful there are half baked ideas abandoned plotlines and br br stunning conveniences that do nothing more than propel this thing br br in some sort of forward direction you have life like dummies for br br practice funerals the blind matriarch does not act all that blind br br and savalas is given the same lollipops he had in kojak who br br haunts ya baby br br the project seems like they had two name stars then wrote the br br script quickly something that happens in hollywood on a daily br br occurrence now savalas looks completely lost delivering his br br lines haltingly and wishing his character had not died in the dirty br br dozen sommer runs around and screams and gasps a lot but br br her character is a blank i use the term character loosely the br br only thing we know about her is her name br br this is a real weird film and your reaction to it might depend on br br how heavily you are into eurohorror and kojak i for one cannot br br recomment lisa and the devil br br this is unrated and including all the extras at the end of the vhs br br copy contains strong physical violence sexual violence strong br br gore strong female nudity male nudity sexual content and adult br br situations
<START> ok even if you can't stand liza this movie is truly hilarious the scenes with john gielgud make up for liza one of the true romantic comedy classics from the 20th century dudley moore makes being drunk and irresponsible look cute and amusing and it is damn fun to watch the one liners are the best
<START> ok so i hear about this new justin timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names i mean great actors like the freeman aka morgan freeman an asset to hollywood however completely wasted in this film then we got kevin spacey who i've been a great fan of ever since i watched american beauty and the usual suspects both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as i did when i heard the story then enter a fresh faced justin timberlake i say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven't hit him yet well the reason for that i might add is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review the movie is so terrible that when i got into the first 15 minutes of it the characters were so one dimensional that it makes some bible characters look like the don corleone they got the one liners and sound bite worthy stuff the token troubled black guy ll cool j who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life the captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone and what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience oh and lots of gun fire i mean a whole lot spoiler not the kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who's crooked dead and the hero prevails they got flame throwers and rocket launchers really no kidding br br bottom line if you want to see edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors or a great fan of justin timberlake to all the 13 year old girls out there enjoy i wish i had more hands because then i would have more thumbs because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening br br may g d have mercy on us all and save us from these terrible movies well it could be worst another rnb terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher hehe check out in the mix lol or even get rich or die trying' now the special thing about that movie is that its got 30 year old men playing 16 or even younger teens i could go on with these
<START> i saw this movie once on late night t v and knew it was the best movie ever this is one of the few kung fu movies with a decent plot the progression of the main character is seamless the whole movie is great
<START> steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse br br this one starts with seagal getting picked up by the fbi because he killed a few people 'in self defence' he's active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the clichÃ© 'evil english villain' that hollywood is so obsessed with including these days br br suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent the story isn't interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story characters of movie as a whole such as the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isn't even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn't need to br br in short a terrible script with bad dialog delivered by sub par actors boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes and non relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near impossible and make the movie even worse br br save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss even if you are seagal's most ardent fan
<START> batman mystery of the batwoman is in a word stale br br the plot goes that a mysterious female vigilante batwoman is intruding on batman's turf and while batman is trying to combat a penguin bane rupert thorne threesome he's trying to figure out who the mysterious batwoman is br br there is nothing strikingly wrong about this but there is nothing really special about it either noting really made it stick out br br mask of the phantasm had bruce's long lost love re surface and mess with his head br br subzero was a major event in the life of mr freeze br br even the batman beyond movie spin off return of the joker dug deep with the characters involved br br but mystery of the batwoman had some minor subplots a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat frankly this thing is more scooby doo than dark knight lacking the punch and bite that the animated series had in it's prime
<START> i rarely write reviews for imdb com but i feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible just terrible i like shaw bros movies i'm not a hater and i had high expectations for this one since i found it listed on many 10 best kung fu martial arts movies websites i'm now convinced that those 10 best lists are all cut and paste jobs first of all there's barely any action in the film most of the movie consists of talking about the plot which is an amazing feat because it's thin at best and the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978 but it's routine by today's standards a special warning to netflix users the dvd they ship is terrible the picture is horrendous and it's not even 16 9 enhanced
