<START> young mr lincoln marks the first film of the director star collaboration of john ford and henry fonda i recall years ago fonda telling that as a young actor he was understandably nervous about playing abraham lincoln and scared he wouldn't live up to the challenge br br john ford before the shooting starts put him at ease by saying he wasn't going to be playing the great emancipator but just a jack leg prairie lawyer that being settled fonda headed a cast that john ford directed into a classic film br br this is not a biographical film of lincoln that had come before in the sound era with walter huston and a year after young mr lincoln raymond massey did the pulitzer prize winning play by robert sherwood abe lincoln in illinois massey still remains the definitive lincoln br br but as ford said fonda wasn't playing the great emancipator just a small town lawyer in illinois the film encompasses about 10 years of lincoln's early life we see him clerking in a general store getting some law books from an immigrant pioneer family whose path he would cross again later in the story and his romance with ann rutledge with her early death leaving lincoln a most melancholy being br br fast forward about 10 years and lincoln is now a practicing attorney beginning to get some notice he's served a couple of terms in the legislature but he's back in private practice not really sure if politics is for him br br this is where the bulk of the action takes place the two sons of that family he'd gotten the law books from way back when are accused of murder he offers to defend them and not an ordinary murder but one of a deputy sheriff br br the trial itself is fiction but the gambit used in the defense of richard cromwell and eddie quillan who played the two sons is based on a real case lincoln defended i'll say no more br br other than the performances the great strength of young mr lincoln is the way john ford captures the mood and atmosphere and setting of a small illinois prairie town in a fourth of july celebration it's almost like you're watching a newsreel and it was the mood of the country itself young vibrant and growing br br fans of john ford films will recognize two musical themes here that were repeated in later films during the romantic interlude at the beginning with fonda and pauline moore who played ann rutledge the music in the background is the same theme used in the man who shot liberty valance for vera miles and at a dance the tune lovely susan brown that fonda and marjorie weaver who plays mary todd is the same one fonda danced with cathy downs to in my darling clementine at the dance for the raising of a church in tombstone br br lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographers and dramatists because of two reasons i believe the first is he's the living embodiment of our own american mythology about people rising from the very bottom to the pinnacle of power through their own efforts in fact young mr lincoln very graphically shows the background lincoln came from and secondly the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in american history and that he made a singularly good and moral decision to free slaves during the civil war albeit for some necessary political reasons his assassination assured his place in history br br besides fonda and others i've mentioned special praise should also go to fred kohler jr and ward bond the two town louts kohler being the murder victim and bond the chief accuser also donald meek as the prosecuting attorney and alice brady in what turned out to be her last film as the pioneer mother of cromwell and quillan and a very nice performance by spencer charters who specialized in rustic characters as the judge br br for a film that captures the drama and romance of the time it's set in you can't do better than young mr lincoln
<START> if you like mech war games it's pretty good some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing i've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie i've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs if you like the genera then games you like are mech warrior three and four and if you have an xbox and 350 to spare steel battalion the movie is worth seeing at least once there really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there less remakes and more original works br br enjoy
<START> this is truly terrible painfully irritating stylised performers screech and mug gratingly incoherent dialogues which take place in scenes which seem to have no purpose no beginning middle or end cut together without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intention all in the service of some entirely uninteresting and almost undetectable story what makes it worse is the film's pretentions to style suddenly a remote head crane shot spirals downwards and without any apparent reason there are sudden whip pans or wobblyhand held sections all this style merely serves to magnify the almost unbelievably huge misconception of the project and the almost offensive vacuity of the material definitely a candidate for the worst film ever made
<START> saw this on cable back in the early 90's and loved it never saw it again until it showed up on cable again recently still find it a great vietnam movie not sure why its not higher rated i found everything about this film compelling as a vet not from vietnam i can relate to the situations brought by both harris and de niro i can only imagine this film being more poignant now with our situation in iraq i wish this would be offered on cable more often for people to see the human toll on our soldiers isn't left on the battlefield its brought home for the rest of there lives and this film is one of many that brings that home in a very hard way excellent film
<START> i always wrote this series off as being a complete stink fest because jim belushi was involved in it and heavily but then one day a tragic happenstance occurred after a white sox game ended i realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow now i could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote or even to the tv to turn the channel but then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch tv in another state nuts to that i said so i decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever fate had in store for me what fate had in store was an episode of this show an episode about which i remember very little except that i had once again made a very broad general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with and once again i was completely right this show is a total crud pie belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn the women are physically attractive but too stepford is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer there is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local tv station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell br br except br br except for the wonderful comic sty lings of larry joe campbell america's greatest comic character actor this guy plays belushi's brother in law andy and he is gold how good is he really well aside from being funny his job is to make belushi look good that's like trying to make butt warts look good but campbell pulls it off with style someone should invent a nobel prize in comic buffoonery so he can win it every year without larry joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking courtney thorne smith smacking belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage 5 stars for larry joe campbell designated comedic bacon because he improves the flavor of everything he's in
<START> this is paul f ryan's first and only full length feature he hasn't done anything since however he managed to get an amazing ensemble cast to portray the characters of his story i don't know when or why the idea emerged in his head but ryan wrote a screenplay which later became his own directed movie home room br br busy philipps carries the movie on her shoulders as alicia a troubled girl the ones we always see in television series with dark hair and black clothes a package of cigarettes in the pocket weird look and disturbing eyes with makeup of course an event has occurred at her school a shooting some students have died and she saw everything now detective martin van zandt victor garber is investigating the case and as expected alicia is a suspect but the shooting is just the genesis the movie is not about the shooting br br lying in bed in a hospital room is deanna cartwright erika christensen she is one of the survivors of the hospital the script establishes a bond between them by the school principal james pickens jr he is helping all the students to recover from the event but alicia doesn't seem to care she's isolated so the principal punishes her she needs to visit deanna every day until five o' clock then the movie starts br br i can't even describe how wonderfully written i think the movie is i can identify with the characters and the situations they live i like reality these things could happen to anyone and the things they say are totally understandable they're growing up and trying to deal with things they haven't experienced they're doing their best without knowing it alicia when she visits deanna for the first time and deanna when she sees alicia standing in front of her are commencing a journey of that will define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life after high school br br the director leads christensen and philipps through their roles very well look the contrast between them deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts no complexity inside of her mind when alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers she asks who has brought them many people deanna answers although some days later we learn they're from her parents who come every week the parental figures are all well represented but are not as important as their sons' characters deanna is lonely alicia seems mature and violent smoking cigarettes and talking roughly but after two days of visiting she finds herself coming back to the hospital every day even sleeping in deanna's room all night when they both have a fight afterwards i believe deanna says why do you keep coming back alicia is lonely too br br the ending of the movie without ruining it comes a bit disappointing it's something i wasn't waiting for it eliminates some of the strength the movie has the revelation comes totally unnecessary ruining the logical climax the movie could have had it was an excellent script anyway and an excellent direction a damn fine movie br br when it comes to erika christensen this was the role she needed to fly higher her role in traffic was impressing but this was the big step the main role maybe not many had the chance to see her in this film and that's a pity she hasn't made one false move since then she has even come out with good performances in awful movies on the other hand busy philipps who proved to be very promising in this movie what a transformation hasn't got many opportunities for other roles br br the same i say about paul f ryan in directing of curse and i expect he is sitting now in his computer finishing his new script i'm waiting for his next movie i'm hoping the best for all of them

<START> sniffing girl's panties kills a guy and a stupid freaky puppet says a lot of stupid freaky things my eyes could not leave the screen my finger could not leave the fast forward button i had to rewatch this spectacle to see if i had really experienced what i thought i did god help us all
<START> this is arguably john thaw's finest performance where he successfully shakes off any traits of his inspector morse character and brings a perfect adaptation of tom from the pages of the book to the tv screen this is a well made production which maintains its family viewing vibe despite some very mature themes like the outbreak of the second world war and the physical abuse suffered by the child br br however it is the relationship between tom and young willie that is the heart and soul of this story it is touching and beautiful to see this bond between the young boy evacuated from london and the grumpy old man he is left with develop a real grandfather grandson connection br br it is a pity that this story wasn't made with a bigger budget with a more established director as it belongs on the big screen not shown once or twice every ten years on a sunday afternoon given the right guidance john thaw would be celebrated the world over and bestowed with many awards for his brilliant performance in this movie a great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was at the time
<START> this sword sorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous hero vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail the acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles the leering gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause since he is as bad as the people he's fighting z movie editing is abundant including a scene where a character dies from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely br br the movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads barbi benton and lana clarkson who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie as a 20 something male i will not pretend that female flesh on the screen doesn't attract me but the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless that i couldn't enjoy even this aspect of the movie br br most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light hearted tongue in cheek feel the sequel is better in this regard but deathstalker seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy no way avoid at all costs br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> the first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts the thematic conflict between the soldier todd and his suppressed humanity and the physical conflict between todd and his bio engineered replacement both sequences are quite gripping in different ways br br peoples' screenplay falters somewhat by resolving the first of these arcs half way through the movie which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp br br nonetheless kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to kurt russell who conveys much with very little br br not a great film but one worth seeing
<START> creep is a straight up serious horror film set in real time that wants nothing more than to just show people get attacked in a empty subway platform by a mutant for 85 minutes and it does just that nothing more nothing less director christopher smith draws out the drama a far as he plausibly can by introducing a series of characters that would actually have a reason to be in the subway after it is locked he also leaves the origins of the titular creep deliberately vague unlawful experiments happening in the 60s underground are hinted at and that little bit of mystery works for the most part sadly he undermines himself toward the end by actually holding back from a twist ending where more genetic malformations would appear they are hinted at as well yes you heard me right i wanted a clichÃ©d twist ending franka run lola run potente is good as the terrorized female lead and the rest of the cast is fine
<START> this movie could have been very good but comes up way short cheesy special effects and so so acting i could have looked past that if the story wasn't so lousy if there was more of a background story it would have been better the plot centers around an evil druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines the movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything it just keeps plodding on christopher walken has a part but it is completely senseless as is most of the movie this movie had potential but it looks like some really bad made for tv movie i would avoid this movie
<START> trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality but these scenes are just rare fragments picked out to attract audience they are of course showing the main message of the movie br br people who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives using power which they may have somewhere else to notoriously oppress others and at the low end of the oppression chain mostly women br br a movie showing this as brutally as hundstage is surely tough to face but having to endure such lives is even tougher br br technically the film is much like short cuts but consisting of documentary style episodes featuring people like your neighbour playing just the way they are without any glitter and most disturbingly without any hope its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing because you realize such people are out there and there are many of them although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks somewhere the porn industry has to do its business somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place somewhere hopes have to shatter i sure do know such people br br if you want to see a movie without any funny scenes some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny but this happens for real and without any melodramatic go watch this movie however it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles i fear as subtitles canÂ´t transport accentuation
<START> what is the most harrowing movie ever made the gynaecological nightmare of 'cries and whispers' the acid psychodramas of fassbinder the discomfiting black comedy of 'last house on the left i'm sure for that portion of the film loving public that tie their masts to the good ship buster keaton there is only one answer any one of his sound films br br i don't know what flayed my soul more poignantly in this movie the grounding of keaton's intricate and expansive physical art to humdrum slapstick the painful hesitation of this master filmmaker with dialogue not that he hasn't a lovely comic voice or that he can't make dialogue funny it's just that the studio don't seem to have given him enough takes and so he seems to be trying to remember his lines before he delivers which only makes him keaton not his character look silly or is it the humiliation of seeing keaton caught up in a tawdry sex farce when he has given us some of the richest accounts of romantic frustration in film br br no i know what was most disturbing having to watch buster keaton cinema's greatest comedian sit aside to observe jimmy durante doing his schtick it is horrors such as this that get yer dantes composing yer infernos br br mgm seem to have got the curious idea that the best way to adapt keaton to sound was to turn him into a marx brother complete with verbal pedantry elaborate tedious 'clowning' shambolic slapstick theatrical setting triumph through chaos and thelma todd keaton was just not that sort of comic and where groucho's malicious tongue and gleeful opportunism might just have made this plot work buster's socially inept professor can't he is too studied and predictable br br what buster needed was to be allowed experiment like lang in 'm' or rene clair he would never have tried to hold back the tide like chaplin when a film like 'the general' is alluded to messing about with trains the loss becomes even more apparent br br and the thing is in patches amid the flat direction the film isn't all that bad there is an excellent jolt when a camera on the bus leaves keaton alone at a railway station and the denouement if hardly original is at least livelier than what went before there is something almost endearing about the way keaton slows down a plot that needs all the zip it can get br br there is a film in here about loneliness emotionally paralysing order the numbing effects of education etc struggling to get out the best way to appreciate this film is to watch not the narrative of professor tz post but of emasculated genius buster keaton trapped in a prison of mediocrity confounded by new technology mocked by a malevolent fate in this case the studio retaining a stoical grace looked at like that it becomes a kind of masterpiece
<START> if dick tracy was in black and white the pope wouldn't be religious giving a new sense to the concept of color in a movie we are offered an unique experience throughout a comic strip world and it's one of the few movies which succeeded in doing so thanks to a serious script good direction great performances al pacino is astonishing and most importantly a powerful mix of cinematography art direction and costume design using only primary colors the experience is quite different from anything we have seen before and there is also a quite successful hommage to all the gangster movie genre pratically extinct from modern cinema overall i see this movie as a fresh attempt and a touch of originality to a cinema which relies more and more on the old and already seen formulas 7 out of 10
<START> bacall does well here especially considering this is only her 2nd film this one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes to have and to have not 1944 and the big sleep 1945 both of which paired her with humphrey bogart granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but i think through no fault of her own i think there was some miscasting in having her portray a british upper crust lady no accent whatsoever i think all the strange accents were distracting boyer was certainly no spaniard it was hard to keep straight which country people were from br br i really liked the black and white cinematography mood is used to great affect i especially liked the fog scene the lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tension br br bacall is just gorgeous boyer just doesn't fit the romantic leading man role for me so he and bacall together was a little strange not great chemistry and certainly no bogie and bacall magic but i still really liked this picture there is great tension and it moves along well enough i must say i found the murder of the little girl quite bold for this period film br br katina paxinou and peter lorre stand out as supporting cast paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely villainous and evil in her portrayal her one scene where she laughs maniacally as mr muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the child's murderer is quite disturbing lorre also does quite well in his slimy snake portrayal of conteras a sleazy coward to the end wanda bendrix also does quite well in portraying the child else especially considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time though she appears much younger turns out she later married auie murphy which proved to be a short lived tempestuous marriage
