<START> gung ho is one of those movies that i never get tired of watching michael keaton has always been a favorite of mine he is absolutely hilarious in this movie matching him step for step is gedde watanabe the two of them work wonderfully together although this movie is a comedy i also like how it shows hunt keaton kazihiro watanabe struggling in their roles as the leaders of their respective groups they both try so hard to keep the peace then they finally get into a fight which is hysterical to watch first they're both on the floor then hunt jumps on a chair kazihiro jumps on the desk hunt jumps on the desk with him the fight then spills out from the office into the factory i love that after they are separated by the workers you can tell that they both feel bad for letting things get so out of hand also there is a scene where you can see the influence that hunt has had on kazihiro he is at his house his boss from japan arrives says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow br br kazihiro tomorrow not good day sakamoto why not kazihiro factory is locked we can't find key br br tell me you can't picture michael keaton saying something like that br br i guess i really like this movie because it is genuinely funny also shows how people that are radically different can not only learn from each other but become good friends as well
<START> i was expecting a very funny movie instead i got a movie with a few funny jokes and many that just didn't work i didn't like the idea of bringing in sherlock holmes' and moriarty's descendants it was confusing it would have been more funny if they just had someone new instead of moriarty resurrected some of the things were funny burt kwouk was very funny as always mccloud on the horse was funny the mcgarrett from hawaii 5 0 was not even mcgarrett like connie booth obviously is very good with accents she is from indiana but played english and a new yorker pretty well unfortunately she was not presented much into the script i was expecting a more funny film instead i got a rather confusing movie with a poor script rather ironic since both booth and cleese were together on this one maybe they were about to break up in 77
<START> as it is generally known anthology films don't fare very well with american audiences i guess they prefer one standard plot line new york i love you is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities the people who live love in them the first was 'paris j'taime' which i really enjoyed the film was made up of several segments each written and or directed by a different director most of which were french but there is a very funny segment directed by joel ethan coen like 'paris' this one is also an anthology directed by several different directors fatih akin mira nair natalie portman shakher kapur etc and also like 'paris'deals with new yorkers and why they love the city they live in it features a top notch cast featuring the likes of natalie portman shia labeouf christina ricci orlando bloom ethan hawki and also features such seasoned veterans as james caan cloris leachman eli wallach and julie christie some of the stories really fly and others don't although i suppose it will depend on individual tastes i won't ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me which ones didn't word is that the next entry in the series will be shanghai china is rome italy berlin germany or athens greece out of the question spoken mainly in english but does have bits of yiddish russian with english subtitles rated 'r'by the mpaa for strong language sexual content
<START> hi i'm a friend of werewolf movies and when i saw the title of darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like hmm simple and nice name to it at least althou i wonder why i haven't heard of it before br br first of all the movie starts with tits lots of tits tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to who cares about a werewolf effect just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots br br so about the mysterious darkwolf character a little spoilers ahead but who really cares he's your average everyday biker not even super tough looking but like the old wise woman says in the movie he is far more powerful and dangerous than you've ever faced before just by describing her a tattooed biker type of a guy pretty original i even had look twice when they first used the red glowing eyes special effect i mean my god that lets plant red dots on eyes with computer effect has been used since the seventies it looks plain ugly here and don't get me started with the werewolf 3d cgi as said before like an bad and old video game br br and finally as i do like werewolf films like i said they prettymuch always build a werewolf legend of their own darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well about some silly legends of hybrid werewolves and the ancient bloodline but it almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched starts random slashing which just doesn't make any sense why even bother telling us the rules of killing when they aren't even gonna play by them aplus the wolf point of view shots are made with a sony handycam or something filming mostly the floor and walls just add growling noises and you've got a super werewolf effect the gore is partially ok but when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims it just doesn't do the trick for me br br truly who gives money to make these heaps of junk straight to video horrortitles they aren't even funny kind of bad movies just sad
<START> i must confess to not having read the original m r james story although i have read many of his other supernatural tales i've also seen most of the previous bbc christmas ghost stories and this one in my opinion surpasses most of them only equalling the signalman br br i can't really fault a view from a hill the direction and 'mood' is perfect as is the acting lighting and of course the story and writing i thoroughly enjoyed this and can only hope for more of this quality from the same director and production team i understand that the bbc plan to make some more not necessarily based on m r james stories so that's promising br br 10 10
<START> someones at the door ohhh how i miss this show so bad but we are lucky to now have invasion thank you shawn cassidy american gothic had it all if i had to pick one thing that i liked best about the show it has to be its not predictable plot lines favorite actor was lucas black i adore that southern accent i bought the dvd asap and my kids are fans too there is some hot n steamy scenes some devilish ones too so if kiddos will be watching you may want to edit fastforward skip it has humour on a joss wheedon level which so many shows lack adult wit and adult situation that are handled with finese the dvd has some extras but i wish it has many more if you want to get thrilled and enjoy a great show come watch american gothic
<START> when thinking about captivity many words come to mind among them are uninteresting unentertaining unsuspensful unsexy unfathomable and unwatchable br br i used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of scream but these new saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics they still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they're aimed at feel like they're hardcore and hip br br this movie is a load of boring crap what the hell has happened to larry cohen his name hasn't been attached to anything good since 1993 even so i was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something this bad was anyone surprised when the movie's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths did anyone not know it when they first saw him only someone who has never before in his or her life ever seen another movie
<START> this film is underrated i loved it it was truly sweet and heartfelt a family who struggles but isn't made into a dysfunctional family which is so typical of films today the film didn't make it an issue that they have little money or are dominican republican the way hollywood have br br instead the issue is victor is immature and needs to grow up he does slowly by the film's end he has a ways to go but it was a heartfelt attempt to move forward his grandmother is very cute and the scene where the little boy throws up had me laughing for the longest time a truly heartfelt indie
<START> go igor go you are the proof that slovenian films may should and must be different there's soul in it and this is rare don't let anybody put you down
<START> one thing i always liked about robert ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out it goes in a completely different direction there are so many twists and turns in this film that i have a sore neck from watching br br one thing i also like about director john dahl kill me again rounders unforgettable is that he can be depended upon to direct and in this case write with his brother rick a good story br br now add nick cage dennis hopper lara flynn boyle and j t walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they are playing characters that all of them have perfected dahl seems to bring out the best in folks and this will keep you interested and guessing until the very end
<START> early heavy war time propaganda short urging people to be careful with their spending practices in effort to prevent any runaway inflation br br using scare guilt and patriotic jingoistic rhetoric which was normal for the time the government was concern that the sudden war time production and therefore wage increase and subsequent spending practices if not checked could cause serious problems during and after the war br br it truly is a window into the past historically and culturally
<START> this film looked interesting i'd read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty tightly br br started watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations in fact i didn't bother watching the whole thing utter drivel bad performances bad acting and instantly dislikeable characters that was the point of the film i guess br br watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the remainder of my weekend br br do not bother with this feature
<START> having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the slavic village broadway area i couldn't wait to see it's final copy br br viewing this film at the cleveland premier last friday i haven't laughed out loud at a comedy in a long time it is great slapstick the russo brothers did a fine job directing the entire cast performs their best comedic acting no slow or dry segments george clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's great as the crippled safe breaker in this flick i was most imprest by william h macy as crook riley and michael jeter's as toto they keep you in stitches i believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie
<START> yes it may be goofy and may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies out there but this movie is truly hilarious if you really watch it tim meadows has always struck me as being funny off of the saturday night live show whenever he would do this character on the show i would crack up laughing so after i saw this was going to be playing on comedy central one night i decided to check it out all in all i was farily impressed with this movie because it wasn't meant to win any oscars or become comedy of the year but it did entertain the saturday night live fans that love the ladies man character this movie is also packed with some highly quotable lines that can be recited for years to come
<START> interesting film about an actual event that took place during the civil war in vermont it kept my attention to the end and i don't regret viewing it i haven't ever read any on this raid incident so i was curious to see if the rebels pulled it off i enjoy historical films from that era br br my major complaint is with the confederate uniforms they look too good the acting was a little stiff at times i like the old man eating the mashed potatoes because he didn't have any teeth the wounded soldier playing fetch with a hound was a little strange overall it was a descent film
<START> this is just as good as the original 101 if not better of course cruella steals the show with her outrageous behaviour and outfits and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of cruella we see a lot more of her this time round i also like ioan gruffudd as kevin the rather bumbling male lead to use paris as the climax of the movie was a clever idea the movie is well worth watching whatever your age provided you like animals
<START> this is a film that had a lot to live down to on the year of its release legendary film critic barry norman considered it the worst film of the year and i'd heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated br br to be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word plot is used because as far as i can see there is no plot as such there's something involving russian gangsters a character called pete thompson who's trying to get his wife sarah pregnant and an irish bloke called sean how they all fit into something called a plot i'm not sure it's difficult to explain the plots of guy ritchie films but if you watch any of his films i'm sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing likewise a james bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes you will have a serious problem believing rancid aluminium has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained br br taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film you'll be watching sadie frost has appeared in some of the worst british films made in the last 15 years and she's doing nothing to become inconsistent steven berkoff gives acting a bad name and he plays a character called kant which sums up the wit of this movie while one of the supporting characters is played by a tv presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this br br the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it's utterly forgettable i saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching i was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching but by now i've mainly forgotten why but this doesn't alter the fact that i remember disliking this piece of crap immensely
<START> i enjoy all the versions of this story but this one is my all time favorite george c scott gives a depth to the scrooge character that the others do not give the movie shows more about why he becomes so bitter the changes in scrooge appear gradually as he encounters the different ghosts and the incidents that they show him br br this movie has the best tiny tim by far he is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager as in the other films anthony walters still has all or most of his baby teeth br br david warner is wonderful as bob cratchit he is such a versatile actor he portrays a man who clearly loves his family he plays the role with dignity neither as a wimpy man cowering under scrooges'thumb but as a man who gracefully puts up with it because he has a family to provide for susannah york and the other actors do a fine job of bringing the characters to life edward woodward is the best ghost of christmas present i've ever seen most often he is played as a jolly santa type character in this he shows anger at scrooges attitudes and really makes scrooge reconsider br br the costumes and the sets really bring the london of dickens time to life a wonderful movie
<START> i may not have the longest of attention spans but this is the second movie i have refused to see all the way through and i even bought it on dvd because of its classic status br br at first i thought that the director was playing a big joke so i kept waiting for a resolution something to laugh at something to keep my interest but this resolution never came rather the writing was laughably amateurish the movie dragged on and felt disjointed like someone cut a tv series to feature length the academy must have been on drugs when they nominated this movie for no less than eight oscars br br once again i repeat myself this is the second movie i have refused to watch all the way through the first was exterminator i hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is 1 10
<START> eddie izzard is a one in a million comic genius he goes from squirrels to wwii to stonehenge to religion to englebert humperdink and it's absolutely hilarious and it all makes sense get a copy of this now you won't regret it i give this an 11 out of 10
