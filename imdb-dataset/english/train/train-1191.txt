<START> this is one of the best reunion specials ever with adam west and burt ward parodying themselves and having fun while doing it it's amazing the amount of effort that went into the detail particularly recapturing the feel of the 1960's era the batcave set wayne manor the costumes and the actors selected to play the younger versions of west ward burgess meredith cesar romero and frank gorshin this 90 minutes is well worth your time and is a delight to all fans of the classic 1960's batman television series i note that clips from batman were from the movie and not the series itself probably because of legal restrictions let's hope the three seasons of the show are forthcoming on dvd
<START> i am sorry to fans of this film but it is the worst thing i have ever seen slow badly cast and badly acted it is a film trying to escape the deadbeat romcoms of the recent years and failing mcdonald and parker seem unable to convey real emotion and are lifeless they seem to be in this one for any pay checks they are getting for it and not because they thought it was a good idea the plot is dull i love great chick films as much as the next girl and this is not one if you avoid one film this year let it be
<START> shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect certainly much more true to the peter o'donnell books and comic strip than the previous two films you can read the strip currently in the reprints from titan books or in comics revue monthly it is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time the movie isn't great but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got and it holds your interest on the dvd extras the interview with quentin tarentino who is obviously stoned is a gas some people have faulted tarentino for associating his name with the film but without him it would never have been made he is a modesty blaise fan and picked a good writer and director all things considered worth 8 stars
<START> starlift is a pleasant and interesting throwback to those all star musical pictures that every studio was putting out during the world war ii years when you've got such stars as gary cooper james cagney doris day gordon macrae and randolph scott etc in the film and with such people as the gershwin brothers cole porter jule styne and sammy cahn supplying the music it's an easy to take film and the plot isn't even in the way br br what plot there is involves two air force enlisted men dick wesson and ron hagerthy trying to meet warner brothers starlet janice rule using as a gimmick the fact that both come from youngstown ohio and hagerthy's father was rule's dentist as well as half of the town's the scheme works too well as louella parsons is soon putting them as an item in her column yes louella's in the film as well she must have liked warner brothers or jack warner catered to her more than the other studio bosses because she also used this studio to publicize her hollywood hotel radio program back in the day br br but the rest of the plot also touched on the real life efforts of ruth roman also playing herself to get her studio and others to do shows at the air force bases for the servicemen and women going to korea some of the names i've mentioned and others sing and perform in a show at travis air force base where a lot of this film was shot br br one specialty number was shot for the talents of phil harris who sing narrates a ballad look out stranger i'm a texas ranger aided and assisted by virginia gibson frank lovejoy and gary cooper yup cooper looked like he was having a great old time kidding his image br br this is the oldest of clichÃ©s when you say they don't make them like this any more but they really don't because you don't have a studio system that has all this talent under contract that's one thing about the demise of the old studio system we can mourn
<START> syriana swept the critics upon release and everything seemed to be raving about it i suppose it's one of those films that is intensely intelligent so intelligent that i think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind i don't consider myself unintelligent i've been studying politics since my early teens and i enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it's a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away i would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it's a 10 10 are lying because they think they look better this film was the most confusing senseless mindless dribble i have seen in awhile especially considering the critical acclaim the oscar nods and the cast screenplay writer stephen gaghan has disappointed me yet again his horribly written havoc preceded this film and i think he's just trying way too hard i can't believe he was offered the opportunity to write the da vinci code screenplay on top of that gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess i had no idea who anyone was why things were happening who was who and what was what it was a disaster br br because i don't really know who anyone was i can only mention the actors and what i thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright george clooney plays c i a field agent and assassin i think bob barnes clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he's managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if i knew what was going on with him i would have really enjoyed his character matt damon plays bryan woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which i can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it amanda peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given christopher plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something i like plummer and love seeing him show up even if he doesn't get top billing anymore br br the cast is intense if only the story made sense i'd like to exact quote the description of plot on imdb a missile disappears in iran but the cia has other problems the heir to an emirate gives an oil contract to china cutting out a us company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a kazakhstani oil contract the department of justice suspects bribery and the oil company's law firm finds a scapegoat the cia also needs one when its plot to kill the emir apparent fails agent bob barnes the fall guy sorts out the double cross an american economist parlays the death of his son into a contract to advise the sheik the cia wants dead the jobless pakistanis join a fundamentalist group all roads start and end in the oil fields what say who now syriana might be the thinking man's movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard i tried to stay with it i eventually surrendered and turned it off after an hour and a half and you couldn't have bribed me enough to get me to finish it i suppose if you want to form an opinion than by all means watch it but i promise you someone looking for entertainment or an enjoyable film will be asleep in the first half hour 1 10
<START> the third and last part of the bourne trilogy duh is lacking a bit in the story department but covers it with extensive action scenes twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better br br the director and star damon themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part because the end of the second movie was quite advanced story wise how they got around that the action scenes for once but they did another thing too which i can't reveal because that would be a spoiler but if you watch the movie than you'll notice it funnily enough i read that this adaptation of the bourne books is the least accurate of all three films if that means anything to you o
<START> i won't go into too much detail about the plot of this movie as other reviewers have covered pretty much the same ground br br just wanted to say that i really enjoyed the film very much peter falk's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film br br a small scale 'road trip' movie with falk paul reiser in upstate ny in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the film br br very well written with an adult target audience in mind plenty of reality based humor some well played drama give the film a feeling that it could be your own family br br really can't say enough about this film except that it's a damn shame that a lovely movie like this doesn't get more exposure while other trashy junk out there does br br it's great to see falk with a big leading man role again he makes the most of it it proves that his famous friend writer director john casavettes was right in casting falk in many of his ground breaking films of the 60s 70s
<START> reading a wide variety of scoop reviews over the past few days i walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from woody happily i couldn't have been more wrong granted woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two but woody the writer director is in fine form and found a credible way to integrate his 70 year old self into the story judging from the laughter and guffaws the audience ate up allen's one liners and dialogue in a way that i haven't seen in several years br br in a movie landscape dominated by software approved story arcs twentysomething tastes and assembly line formula fare for kiddies it's a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see allen pursuing his highly personal and still rewarding path
<START> this movie has everything emotion power affection stephane rideau's adorable naked beach dance it exposes the need for real inner communion and outer communication in any relationship just because cedric and mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay doesn't mean there isn't quite useful insight for anybody in it i would probably classify it as a gay movie but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people mathieu's incapacity to handle his emotions divulges the way our society doesn't encourage us to act any differently and that is what engenders the discord between him and cedric this is definitely a must see
<START> picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyper stylized black and white visuals of frank miller's sin city then picture a dystopian science fiction thriller such as steven spielberg's minority report or richard linklater's a scanner darkly an amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director christian volckman's bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut but although volckman's work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them such a simplistic hybrid does not do renaissance volckman's end result justice the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than that br br genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair especially in a contemporary context with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted as such renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci fi drama which serve to compliment each other's storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion the screenplay is a clever and intriguing one although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the english translation the film's title also becomes far more poignant managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes making for a truly compelling work br br volckman's film truly excels in its visual component and the stunning black and white animation is easily the film's highlight superbly moody and stylish it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have with tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene the film appears straight out of a frank miller comic but with a twist the end result being consistently visually sumptuous br br the film's english rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting the gruff voice of daniel craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim stoic policeman karas and catherine mccormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sister's disappearance he is investigating despite a wavering english accent romola garai does great work as the frantic sister in question and jonathan pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega corporation avalon ian holm's reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist and holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes br br all together renaissance boasts a visually stunning unique and compelling futuristic thriller just as intelligent as it is entertaining though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms for fans of either of the film's intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of frank miller or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller the film is without question worth a watch br br 8 10
<START> but it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on weird al like i did it's a mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins it's uneven in places but some of the segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to japan although it's not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation and he doesn't find love however fleeting he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street life br br perhaps weird al isn't recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet still this is a funny movie
<START> a girl's folly is a sort of half comedy half mockumentary look at the motion picture business of the mid 1910's we get a glimpse of life at an early movie studio where we experience assembly of a set running through a scene handling of adoring movie fanatics even lunch at the commissary we are also privy to little known cinematic facts for example did you know that frequently 'movie' actors do not know the plot of the picture in which they are working br br the plot of this film in essence is movie star kenneth driscoll's discovery and romancing of a budding young starlet whom he discovers while shooting on location in the country i believe the 30 minute version i watched was abridged included on the same tape with cecil b de mille's the cheat it is a very credible film an easy watch with a large cast of extras as a bonus it includes some of best illustrated captions i have ever seen accompanying a silent movie
<START> definitely one of the lesser of the astaire rogers musicals it's just very poorly plotted and paced it only runs a few minutes longer than swing time for example but it feels a heck of a lot longer this is partly due to the secondary romance between randolph scott and harriet hilliard scott is rarely ever interesting i like hilliard she's sweet and i love at least one of her songs but where are you get thee behind me satan her other number is a weak leftover from top hat thankfully cut from that masterpiece follow the fleet would actually be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between astaire and rogers the dancing contest vies for the top spot of any of their numbers the dance is just fantastic i'm putting all my eggs in one basket presents the two rehearsing a dance that they don't quite have perfected yet its imperfections make it all the more perfect and let's face the music and dance is easily one of irving berlin's best songs so the film is well worth watching for its great moments
<START> ah the 1970's a time when it was in to be a swinger to be honest today is also a good time to be a swinger but it just felt more daring then br br joe sarno offers up a pretty good soft core film in fact just like today some of the actors are famous hardcore actors unlike today these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character development br br it's pretty much what you would expect out of a swinger's movie two couples with open relationships re ignite the wanderlust out of the milf of one of the women who has come for a visit not much more to it br br of course when the milf is jennifer welles then it is a different story not too many 40 somethings look as delicious undressed as ms welles it's worth the price alone to see ms welles look at herself in the mirror as if she's aphrodite she's no stifler's mom she's way sexier br br i also digged chris jordan's anna jordan looks and sounds so much like elaine joyce that i thought she might be her separated at birth twin or even elaine herself anna is always eating but must have incredible metabolism br br unlike 1990's soft core porn 70's softie porn retained the hardcore film's realism something that 2000's soft core has brought back on occasion instead of the 90's music and canned orgasms and it is here in full force it's not real but it feels real br br for those who enjoyed the quebec produced deux femmes en or you'll enjoy this one another classic film only on drive in classics the best 2 50 can a month you can spend
<START> one can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as morgan freeman can take the time to assist someone who needs help br br it all comes down to loving people as will rogers said i never met a man i didn't like of course if you meet paz vega what's not to like that smile of hers can melt diamonds she is just so fantastic that i can watch anything she is in the same goes for freeman he is just magic on the screen br br the two of them gave us a film that was funny from start to finish from the mexican supermarket to lorraine bobby to packy it was tender charming and just plain funny br br you have to check this out
<START> ok the cons first the obligatory '70's alligator all right correction caiman with nonmoving limbs is made the worse for scale miniature underwater shots with the full length of reptile comparative to the size of the boat utilizing a toy alligator being swirled around the toy boat in broadly lit water even for nighttime shots br br unlike most primitives killing exploitative westerners films the superstitious natives going bat and start massacring the vacationers seems unjustified this time no one really abused the natives exploited yes but far from abusive treatment after all it was one of the natives canoodling with a spoiled supermodel during a taboo full moon that brought the curse of the river demon on them right br br the vacationers are easily annoying with the notable exception of the token old soul mildly blasphemous little girl who takes a shine to the heroes that you often see in 70's euroflicks but far from from deserving violent death unless they were your next door neighbors mind you a couple actually get killed being heroic notable in that none of them fill the role of sidekick there are only two straight villains in the entire film so the demises feel more arbitrary than cathartic br br the sequence where the giant caiman crunches down and scarfs thirty tourists in under five minutes will probably strike you as unintentionally hilarious br br the point at which the natives decide not to wipe the surviving westerners and practically saying hey you aren't so bad after all sorry about that fuss last night because they blew up the monster lizard has you shaking your head as the corny music kicks in you know the local military dictatorship will wipe out the village for ing with the tourist trade after the credits roll br br the pros barbara bach barbara bach barbara bach barbara bach you all know why you're interested in this film in the first place right i thought so if you're a bach completist get the dvd reissued by noshame films earlier this year digitally remastered with no real extras to speak of aside from the director bemoaning the current state of international film distribution br br the hero isn't half bad being far from an idiot always a plus in b films and the cynical little kid provides most of the comic relief br br worth a look but get it cheaply
<START> an enthralling wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent martin scorsese many of the films he speaks of are easy to relate to his works particularly the earlier ones the silent era very enjoyable despite being a bit long i found this to be one of the best documentaries on film yet required viewing if you admire martin scorsese and his work
<START> as predictable as a hallmark card but not without merit the rookie makes for a solid outing dennis quaid the most reasonable jock actor working today is absolutely perfect as the science teacher turned baseball player jimmy morris the film is never dumbed down for the children as would be expected from a g rated film as a sports film the rookie is one of the best i have seen since any given sunday
<START> bizarre tobe hooper exercise regarding an unfortunate young man brad dourif with the ability to set people on fire this ability stems from parents who partook in atomic experiments in the 50's they die of spontaneous human combustion and it seems that what sam is beginning to suffer from derives by these pills his girlfriend lisa cynthia bain gives him to take for rough migraines in actuality lisa was told to manipulate sam into taking the pills by lew orlander william prince pretty much the young man's father who raised him from a child lew has benevolent plans he sees sam as the first atomic man a pure killing machine in human form sam never wanted this and will do whatever it takes to silence those responsible for his condition as the film goes sam's blood is slowly growing toxic green in color instead of red it seems that water and other substances which often put out fire react right the opposite when sam's uncontrollable outbursts of flame ignite come to find out lisa has sam's condition whose parents also dies from shc dr marsh jon cypher someone who sam has known for quite some time as his physician is to insert toxic green fluid into their bodies i'm guessing to increase their levels of flame nina melinda dillon sporting an accent that fades in and out was sam's parents' friend and associate on the experiments in the 50's who tries to talk things over with him regarding what is happening and rachel dey young is sam's ex wife who may be working against her former husband with lew and marsh to harm him and lisa br br quite a strange little horror flick filled with some pretty awful flame effects dourif tries to bring a tragic element and intensity to his character whose plight we continue to watch as his body slowly becomes toxic waste with fire often igniting from his orifices there's this large hole in his arm that spits out flame like a volcano and a massive burn spot on his hand which increases in size over time best scene is probably when director john landis who portrays a rude electrical engineer trying to inform sam to hang up because the radio program he's calling has sounded off for the night becomes a victim of shc the flick never quite works because it's so wildly uneven with an abrupt ridiculous finale where sam offers to free lisa of her fire by taking it from her
<START> i'm a true fan of the original cracker series and own all of them on dvd cracker had a tendency to be over the top on occasion but robbie coltrane and the other cast members as well as the writers always seemed to carry it off despite themselves i count the original cracker among the great brit tv crime series of that time and there's some stiff competition prime suspect inspector frost inspector morse jeremy brett's sherlock homes and a host of others cracker along with prime suspect was on the top of my list br br which makes a new terror all the more sad br br ultimately this was a very pale imitation of cracker's former glory i forced myself to sit through the whole thing convinced that it couldn't actually be this bad and that some spark would eventually ignite i was wrong it was bad from beginning to end br br a few criticisms first just to get any potential bias up front right off i was offended by the anti american anti war screed that droned on and on throughout most of the show the topper the murder of two american's innocent of any crime and a british junkie is in fitz's words understandable but not justified i thought i waded through two hours of crap just to hear this disgusting bit of drivel so i had a negative reaction to the anti war american tone brought on by my beliefs beyond the politics i had the distinct sense that this cracker was merely a prop for the propaganda and it actually helped to undermine an already terribly weak script br br second just how much air time did robbie coltrane get fitz was almost a bit player in this one as if he was an afterthought plugged into some story originally written without any thought of fitz's role coltrane could have carried the show on his own broad and still suitably flabby shoulders but the writer was apparently thinking of other things and missed the chance and by a wide margin br br third what an abysmal script there was some sparkle and a couple of bits of actual character development fitz's son ranting that fitz couldn't stay at his house if he missed his plane to australia the detective that liked to beat his poor performers over the backs of their heads and some of the old sparks between fitz and his missus but not nearly enough to carry the tedious storyline br br fourth where the hell was panhallagan now that would have been interesting it was manchester after all and 10 years on she'd be up in the ranks another wasted opportunity or perhaps the actress wasn't interested br br well there's much more that's bad to say but i'll close with a curiosity at the end of the show as it aired on bbca when the advertisement announced that the director's cut was available on bbc on demand i thought ah ha the director's cut which presumably one has to pay for might have all of the goodies i expected to see tonight but never did like a coherent interesting storyline unfortunately after convincing myself to sit through the horrible free version of a new terror with the hope of seeing something anything worth watching only to be disappointed i have no hope left to motivate me to actually pay for a second potentially longer and more tedious version besides it angered me to think that bbca sliced and diced and sacrificed show time to accommodate the endless every ten minutes or so stream of commercials and then turned around and asked me to pay for what probably should have been version aired tonight br br to close i quote the first paragraph of variety's review of a new terror it really says it all initial excitement about robbie coltrane reprising his role as the bbc's flawed boozing womanizing criminal psychologist is snowed under by the heavy handed political statement writer jimmy mcgovern is determined to deliver within this revival vidpic jolting at first in its message namely that americans are a bunch of whiny namby pambies who didn't care a whit about terrorism before it came crashing onto our doorstep mcgovern's chest clearing rant overwhelms the narrative and mutes the pleasure of seeing fitz back on the case
