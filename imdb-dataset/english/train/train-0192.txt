<START> this insipid mini operetta featuring a eddy mcdonald prototype in a valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes it's silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers in under a minute he is packed off to morrocco where he lives a double life as the red shadow the leader of an arab tribe that would rather sing than fight br br alexander gray and bernice clare possess fine light opera voices with little acting ability and there's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along br br this two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers with more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation
<START> i saw this movie as a very young girl i'm 27 now and it scared me witless for years i had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to obviously the violence my parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie i think they only say that knowing that i have such strong feelings about it 0 i am currently reading the book out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it's a classic and it is really a great story however i don't think that it should have been made into a cartoon ever well maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and i still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way gives me a little heart palpitation every time yah i am a wuss but i strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content not everyone finds it as disturbing as i did but we are out there 0
<START> when ritchie first burst on to movie scene his films were hailed as funny witty well directed and original if one could compare the hype he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal loathing his last two outings have created one should consider has ritchie been found out is he really that talented does he really have any genuine original ideas or is he simply a pretentious and egotistical director who really wants to be fincher tarantino and leone all rolled into one colossal and disorganised heap after watching revolver one could be excused for thinking were did it all go wrong what happened to his great sense of humour where did he get all these mixed and convoluted ideas from revolver tries to be clever philosophical and succinct it tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis it tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller ritchie does make a gargantuan effort to fulfil all these many objectives and invests great chunks of a script into existential musings and numerous plot twists however in the end all it serves is to construct a severely disjointed unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film to the audience its plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although ritchie does at least attempt to give his own spin he should be punished for even trying to pass it off as his own work so what the audience gets ultimately is a terrible screenplay intertwined with many pretentious oneliners and clumsy setpieces br br revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and bland movie that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces like fight club usual suspects and pulp fiction it aims high but inevitably shots blanks aplenty br br revolver deserves to be lambasted it is a truly poor film masquerading as a wannabe masterpiece from a wannabe auteur however it falls flat on its farcical face and just fails at everything it wants to be and achieve
<START> don't see this this was one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen its hard to be mormon sometimes when there are movies like this out there what a sad view of mormon life i can tell you if you did see this movie that it is not all like this at all in a singles ward if it was i don't think i would have made it through it its too bad that most mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do the acting was so bad that my wife and i barely made it through i guess you could say that it had all the signs of a b movie or are there c movies anyway i just thought this movie sucked and was full of cheese i wish some mormons would start making some quality movies
<START> way back in 1967 a certain director had no idea about a galaxy far away or near he was trying to complete a movie with the title thx etc this short is a remanufactured history of a certain george i am sorry it has only cuteness to defend it this is merely an advertising promo for the director actors et al it has little intrinsic artistic value it is a brochure the lead playing george is very fine as is the leia character and the ersatz darth character all else is plain commercial dross what a waste still it got the job done i guess the rest of the movie is merely treading water to kill time i guess a brochure only
<START> i'm not a big fan of the stooges' slapstick but i find their history interesting i've recently tried to check out stuff from each stooge era but the opportunity to see joe shorts doesn't seem to come easy this is the only one i've seen so far br br some say the quality problems with joe era shorts are really not joe's fault and i suspect that's the case joe as a performer is far from the worst thing about this the thing that bothers me the most about it has been pointed out in another comment the pitting of the other guys against the third violates the whole comedy team stooges ethos perhaps joe's style was perceived by those in charge as not really fitting in though there were no real off camera conflicts between him the others and this was their way of working around that br br and what's with the titles of this and some of the other late stooges shorts definitely a lack of creativity going on there was that sort of thing the cause or the effect of the shorts market drying up
<START> this movie answers the question how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is codependent clinging needy jealous and has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal women br br without spoiling the movie i can safely assure you it does not but there's great fun to be had along the way uma thurman is perfect as the mercurial super heroine an uber babe mysteriously named g girl who unlike most in her sisterhood is not always dedicated to truth justice and the american way br br thurman is also believable as the thoroughly daft yet somehow still fetching curator jenny when she is dumped for a less endowed but more emotionally secure and well adjusted rival g girl goes ballistic and what follows is not pretty it's funny but it's not pretty br br it's a delightful premise hell hath no fury like a super heroine scorned and those involved don't altogether carry it off but it has its moments and i think i'll get the dvd br br i liked this movie
<START> one question that must be asked immediately is would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of jacqueline lee bouvier kennedy onassis br br the answer is probably not br br but thankfully they are or were the cousin and aunt of jackie br br this documentary by the maysles brothers on the existence one could hardly call it a life of edith b beale jr and her daughter edith bouvier beale edie has the same appeal of a train wreck you don't want to look but you have to br br big edith and little edie live in a once magnificent mansion in east hampton new york that is slowly decaying around them the once beautiful gardens are now a jungle br br magnificent oil painting lean against the wall with cat feces on the floor behind them and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines br br living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others br br clothing is seems to be optional edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head br br as edith says edie is still beautiful at 56 and indeed she is there are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there br br there is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension br br their eating habits are to be polite strange ice cream spread on crackers a dinner party for edith's birthday of wonder bread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensils br br time is irrelevant in their world as edie says i don't have any clocks br br their relationships with men are oh so strange br br edie feels like edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness she says if you can't get a man to propose to you you might as well be dead to which edith replies i'll take a dog any day br br it is obvious that edith doesn't see her role in edie's lack of male companionship early in the film she states france fell but edie didn't br br sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other br br there is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with wonder bread and cat food the cats and there are many of them are everywhere br br at one point edie declares the hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility but they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselves br br this is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort
<START> the literary genius of vladimir navokov is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice the director puts us in check mate with the story of alexander an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted she meets alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket a magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day the mother alarmed telegrams the husband he arrives and questioning alexander we get these fades to the past ala' godfather ii where we see young alexander a child prodigy he is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums thinking alexander reached his peak abandons him but becomes legend the old teacher returns causing harm trying to give victory to an old rival of alexander in a serious chess game where world chess champion victory is one way to immortality the chess clock ticks match time ends to conclude the next day that day is nastasya's wedding the old teacher interferes and alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown nastasya holding her stomach and looking thru her love's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves though the film unfortunately sways from its russian roots its low back cut dresses are lovely alexander plays his role sublimely the director underestimated her audience we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of the luzhin defense is after trading queens isolate the opponents king with your 3 paws king sacrificing the castle for mate nastasya is a great match but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her the luzhin defense elegantly gives navokov honor the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed
<START> buster absolutely shines in this episode which is the only vehicle i've seen towards the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical and silent comedy that made him famous it's still a shock to hear his gravelly voice in the talkie sequences his voice is about the only thing i don't care for as far as buster is concerned but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled he even repeats some of the gags used in his early two reelers with roscoe arbuckle br br my deepest gratitude to rod serling for presenting us with this episode and for giving buster's genius full scope he didn't have much time one episode to do it in but this is a touching tribute to hollywood's greatest genius
<START> i've seen this film literally over 100 times it's absolutely jam packed with entertainment powers boothe gives a stellar performance as a fan of actors such as william shatner impulse 1974 and ron liebmann up the academy 1981 i never thought an actor could capture the intensity like shatner and liebmann in those roles until i saw boothe as jim jones as far as i'm concerned powers boothe is jim jones this film captures his best performance
<START> perfect movies are rare even my favorite films tend to have flaws rear window looks a little stagey at times chris elliot's character in groundhog day doesn't work the music score in best years of our lives is too cheesy the beginning of nights of cabiria is a little too slow but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish br br the script is brilliant the acting is superb all around although reese witherspoon and sam waterston are amazing the whole cast shines the directing and the photography are inspired and the music score is touching without being intrusive like some miramax scores that are too manipulative every sad moment is truly moving every light moment makes me smile this truly is one of the best films i have ever seen and i wish there were more films like it br br i am glad that reese witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film but i am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people real feelings and real problems brilliant a must see
<START> this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine moronic idiots the men get stoned drunk and then they yell beat each other up in almost every scene the women are superfluous to the story Â i do not understand what they are there for Â they spend every scene causing a ruckus or worse milling around like mesmerized cattle apparently canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks it's the standard knocked up girlfriend her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before br br every character here is a carping infantile stereotype not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower and the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with george wendt Â shudder Â is enough to make anyone gag i watched the movie because samuel west was in it Â but i cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this maybe he needed the money ian tracey is a superb actor the only one with a vague redeeming moment but his talent is wasted here br br as for the rest of the plot Â the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back Â yawn or karl Â who is dead but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcock's masterpiece Â although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films why even bother karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying br br by the end of this wretched movie i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat
<START> first of all i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema which is because the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos as the director and marketing ads imply in my mere opinion the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what i meant br br however the acting is near perfect in fact most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what altioklar lacked talent all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job even the less experienced ones like janset at least altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation just because he knows well how to choose the cast other than that he is just a media monkey who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent come on art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked half naked women and just because media boasts off no director becomes a milestone in the history of turkish cinema just close your ears and o something real artistic i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work hope this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach br br in short pros good acting hot women just kidding cons each and every single thing other than the cast

<START> i had such high hopes for this film because i loved the original so much it seems that disney however is trying to perfect the art of crappy straight to dvd sequels they deserve a razzie several in fact i thought the idea had merit but the music was absolutely awful and the story wasn't much better what happened to the great music disney used to have in their films mary poppins aladdin beauty and the beast the lion king even hercules and the hunchback of notre dame they've made so many great movies over the years that it's really sad that they've sunk to point of making sequels that aren't even good enough to put in theatres br br i hope this movie is not an indication of things to come for the walt disney corporation
<START> with movies like this you know you are going to get the usual jokes concerning ghosts eva as a ghost is pretty funny and the other actors also do a good job it is the direction and the story that is lacking that could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better the problem only is that there aren't many jokes sure i laughed a couple of times apart from the talking parrot there wasn't an ounce of creativity to be noticed in the movie i blame the director not using the premise to it's full potential eva certainly has the comedic skill to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so overall this movie is ideal for a sunday afternoon other than that it can be skipped completely
<START> this movie is soooo funny the acting is wonderful the ramones are sexy the jokes are subtle and the plot is just what every high schooler dreams of doing to his her school i absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism if you like monty python you will love this film this movie is a tad bit grease esk without all the annoying songs the songs that are sung are likable you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through this musical ranks number two in musicals to me second next to the blues brothers but please do not think of it as a musical per say seeing as how the songs are so likable it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place i think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance you will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager needless to say you will be reminiscing of your old high school days after seeing this film highly recommended for both the family since it is a very youthful but also for adults since there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience
<START> this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that i've ever seen on screen andy goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it's primitive in a good sense his purity honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art i was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end sometimes prematurely but his scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that goldsworthy's art has it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself fred frith's score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect it has no boundaries as far as age goes
