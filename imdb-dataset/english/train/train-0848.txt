<START> how truly friendly charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial i rejoiced in seeing old lugosi it is disarmingly friendly and lively it's the document of a longÂlost craft the best tv series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials chandu is deeply deeply optimistic and hedonistic it refreshes the mind it's not stupid stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work chandu has an irresistible sense of simple unpretentious and friendly fun br br without giving away too muchÂchandu is an occidental sorcerer who goes also by this eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers br br chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way br br as to the quite sexy niece nadji she is kidnapped by the priest of ubasti the sordid vindhyan the poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnappedÂin a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower almost kidnapped from a boat by a phony policeman the temple of lemuria and its strange creepy ceremonies resemble the king kong imageryÂand are a barbaric mockery of the rcc ceremonies and rituals br br would you protect a girl as bravely as chandu does br br lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless mean drunk and this only contributed to his performances he is the prototypical mean drunk uncle mischievous and cunning and oblique this might sound like a rather crooked homage to lugosiÂyet burton's biopic of wood left me this impression about lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor i enjoy lugosi' fancy performances br br this serial is unjustly bashed
<START> raising victor vargas is just a bad film no amount of denial or ad dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact br br maybe peter sollett saw he didn't have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current edgy film making maybe he just doesn't know any better it's hard to tell br br what's not hard to tell is the result except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film making into an attempt at pseudo realism few will enjoy it br br i know i didn't br br do yourselves a favor and pass on this film
<START> mel gibson's braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film but it left a sour taste in the mouth rob roy by contrast is slightly less polished but a better film by far this is a historical film which combines timeless themes with truly historical values whereas braveheart put a gross and unpleasant comtemporary gloss on an ancient tale what makes this film is the cast liam neeson plays the hero in a role he basically reprised in a watered down fashion in the phantom menace the character is heroic but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover admirable yet human he commands the screen against him are set a selection of equally human adversaries including tim roth's cunningham obnoxious but brilliant and john hurt's morally bankrupt laird also to praise is jessica lange as rob's pragmatic wife also strong and noble but 300 years away from a modern heroine which is only as it should be this is not the most original film you will see but it has the courage of its own convictions and the strong performances make you care
<START> 'how to lose friends alienate people' is a superb film a hilarious film from start to end a lovely entertainer enjoyed it thumps up br br performances jason is fantastic he's a treat to watch him from start to end jeff bridges is excellent as the boss he's a legend megan fox looks amazingly hot and deliver a good performance but dude she's so hot man anderson is delightful she doesn't look old at all still hot indeed kristan dunst looks lovely and does a pretty good job others are also pretty good br br 'how to lose friends alienate people' is a excellent entertainer don't miss this flick
<START> once in a while a movie will sweep along that stuns you draws you in awes you and in the end leaves you with a renewed belief in the human race from the artistry form this is not it this is an action movie that lacks convincing action it stinks rent something else
<START> bromwell high is a cartoon comedy it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life such as teachers my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high's satire is much closer to reality than is teachers the scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools i knew and their students when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately recalled at high a classic line inspector i'm here to sack one of your teachers student welcome to bromwell high i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched what a pity that it isn't
<START> now let me tell you about this movie this movie is my favorite movie this movie has excellent combat fighting this movie does sound like a silly story line about how jet li plays a super hero like spider man or etc but once you've seen this movie you would probably want to see it again and again i rate this movie 10 10
<START> deeply emotional it can't leave you neutral br br yes it's a love story between 2 18 years old boys but it's only the body of this movie and it's been removed you only feel what happened with these boys you feel the soul of the movie with of course some action some sex but this is no pornography too many feelings br br it was only a summer story and it became from love to hate almost to death the most important time of their lives i loved it you will too whatever your feelings are
<START> i came across an insomniac's nightmare while looking for offbeat independent films and glad to say it did not disappoint this crazy half hour ride had me wondering all the way through and the ending was excellent one of those nooooo moments that really stays with you i've shown it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree hands down the little ghostie girl was very talented and i think her performance stole the show she creeped the heck out of me i can say that much nanavati did a great job putting this short together all the pieces just fell into place and you can tell that she's a great writer from what she did with this script so well written it's undoubtedly the strongest part of the film the directing was great and the acting was enjoyable but the most important factor here is the strength of the screenplay good job to this girl i can't wait to see more
<START> this film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment promising to develop into something worth hanging on for but it doesn't it's flat self conscious unimaginative and tedious br br a series of set images and backdrops don't make a film they make a calendar this kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary it's true it really happened not only fails to entertain it fails to convince so it doesn't even function as social history clichÃ©s co mingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly the characters are one dimensional never developing to the extent that one feels for them the director's ego is the largest character in this film
<START> what you were not aware that scooby doo battled zombies well you might also not be aware of this little film that was directed by victor halperin who had also directed white zombie four years earlier that would probably make it the second zombie film made br br no don't go looking for dorothy stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie films and don't even look for any brains being eaten this is 1936 you know br br so what you will see is typical of the period lots of talking br br you do get to see dean jagger twelve o'clock high and bela lugosi's eyes but that is about it zombies in cambodia indeed
<START> when i was a kid i totally loved both bill ted movies the other night bogus journey was on and since it was at least 5 years since i last saw it i decided to tune in and i loved it all over again this film is still funny after all those years 'excellent adventure' is better but this one rocks just the same sure some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy but hey this entire film is cheesy in a cool way plus it features the coolest personation of death ever in a movie concluding totally like non bogus movie dude way excellent station
<START> i don't understand your objections to this movie it is a taut thrilling extension of the character created in basic instinct the only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic is the fact that sharon stone's character is still alive and not in jail at this late date br br spoiler alert as the movie progresses we are presented with three theories of what is going on 1 sharon stone's character is killing all these people because she's crazy risk addicted 2 david thewlis' crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame sharon stone's character 3 david morrissey's analyst is killing these people for revenge what upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the real story although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop the only killing that occurs on screen br br i think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of 2001 a space odyssey who cares what is real the blonde really is crazy the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge what's important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story like real life everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie get over it
<START> big s isn't playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like say mencia or chapelle though i like them both she states the obvious in subtle near subliminal remarks her show won't change the world nor is it meant to but along with the hilarious brian posehn and paget brewster's ex boyfriend jay johnston of mr show fame this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction my side's were thoroughly wrecked by the first episode look i love this woman and like her famed boyfriend jimmy kimmel she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run with it the best kind of comedy around spoofing anything and anyone like mary poppins in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense this one is highly recommended but only for those who still have a funny bone and didn't lose it in their most recent lippo suction treatment or boob job
<START> this extremely low budget movie is compared to the great classic silent night deadly night since it is labeled as a slasher flick first let me say that i think that even silent night part 2 is better than this that one was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie christmas evil tries to get psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes insane a strong word slowly very slowly he is irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of christmas and at work he can't stand how the fabricated toys are made with such lack of quality and love dressed up as santa he finally goes on a killing spree also a strong word since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects no tension no thrills no gore no cast for one exception that is jeffrey demunn is in it he is best known for playing aside tom hanks as one of the guards in the classic the green mile he still must be kicking himself these days for ever accepting the role he truly is the only one who really can act his supporting role is better than the main lead who also isn't that bad but if you're overshadowed by a little supporting character you're not great either and what about that strange ending you have to see it to believe it christmas evil is downright boring nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading this is not a slasher you wanna see a real christmas slasher check out the all time greatest silent night deadly night
<START> this movie was the worst i've ever seen br br it doesn't seem to have a plot but the time you realize this is far beyond the beginning of the movie so you have to watch the shut for a long time to recognize the total incompetence of the director aka the sloth that plays the tampon chick in the movie and we do not believe the willem dafoe in this movie he's a clone because the real dafoe like we know from apocalypse now and the boon dock saints would never agreed to such a script br br duh da foe wrote this bill shut together with his twenty years minus baby this movie starts with the credits of the two main characters dafoe and colagrande and then the two script writers dafoe and colagrande and then the director colagrande br br bottomline the story widow meets guy guy bangs widow widow smashes windscreen with guy who banged her br br title in netherlands the black widow different title same bullshit br br do not watch this movie it's a total waist of time
<START> this film is one giant pant load paul schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay and his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process br br the worst though is woody harrelson whom i ordinarily like when he's properly cast he plays the walker a homosexual man in d c who plays social companion to the bored wives of the washington elite he couldn't have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick his southern accent is that off the rack version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers as though the heat and humidity of the south is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has it is monotonous but his is not the worst accent in the movie his boyfriend played by moritz bleibtreau attempts to affect some kind of a mid east accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him he is incapable of rolling his r's in spite of the fact that in real life he is german and speaks several languages one of them being italian that's kind of a good reason to cast someone else don't ya think br br from the story to the screenplay to the directing to the camera work to the performances by the leads this movie is bad from beginning to end the only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses lily tomlin lauren bacall and kristin scott thomas only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact in fact all three are excellent in spite of being trapped in a really bad film ufortunately no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws if you like these three actresses watch them in something else this movie is not worth your time
<START> spoiler alert this movie zero day gives an inside to the lives of two students andre and calvin who feel resentment and hatred for anyone and anything associated with there school br br they go on a series of self thought out missions all leading up to the huge mission which is zero day zero days contents are not specified until the middle to the end of the movie the viewer knows its serious and filled with hate but is never quite sure until the end br br now we all know if the movie is based on the columbine massacre the ending is pretty obvious and the ending is no different than any other movie about the attack they go and kill many of their fellow students in the end br br i have seen a lot of movies on this attack and this movie by far is my favorite and most respected it gives the viewer and inside look to the lives of these two teens who hate life and honestly it gives the viewer some what of an understanding and a closure on the horrible event br br being only 7 when the events played out i never knew the seriousness of the shootings until my english class was assigned an essay or story on a defining moment in our generation well i knew everyone was going to pick the twin towers but i wanted to be different because of course the twin towers was tragic and very defining but i didn't think it was the right choice for me because there was really no way of relating to that because i was only in the 3rd grade and i had no idea what it all meant but the shootings did leave and effect i remember the interviews the sky views of the school and the hurt and terror in the eyes of thousands of people br br this movie is a compelling down to earth and horrific masterpiece and i would reccomened it to anyone
<START> nothin' there ain't nothing' in room 237 but you ain't got no business going' in there anyway so stay out you understand stay out br br never has there been such a feat of psychological horror as this film achieves this is the highest rated horror film of all and rightly so jack nicholson is a superb actor and this is one of the greatest performances in cinema br br its about a family moving to an isolated and deserted hotel for 5 months over the winter then the father jack becomes almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel br br kubricks direction is nothing short then perfect the tense tracking shots agonising music mystical messages and perplexing plot makes this the best horror film ever made br br throughout the film there is constant references to danger death and horror red is used in every scene is the red purposely put in by kubrick of course br br this is a definitive kubrick classic and this is the third of his films i have given 10 10 he is a perfectionist in his direction and you can see it in all his films he loves to perplex his watchers in everyone of his films br br i will be talking about this film for months to come it has infinite depth br br in conclusion this is the cornerstone of horror and tension a masterpiece of terror 10 10
<START> after watching two of his silent shorts 'elena and her men 1956 ' is my first feature length film from french director jean renoir and i quite enjoyed it however i didn't watch the film for renoir but for star ingrid bergman who Â at age 41 Â still radiated unsurpassed beauty elegance and charm throughout the early 1950s following her scandalous marriage to italian roberto rossellini bergman temporarily fell out of public favour her next five films directed by her husband were unsuccessful in the united states and i suspect that renoir's latest release did little to enhance bergman's popularity with english speaking audiences however she did regain her former success with an oscar in the same year's 'anastasia 1956 ' she stars as elena sokorowska a polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere before promptly abandoning them while working her lucky charms to aid the political aspirations of the distinguished general francois rollan jean marais she finds herself falling into a love that she won't be able to walk away from this vaguely political film works well as either a satire or a romantic comedy as long as you don't take it too seriously it's purely lighthearted romantic fluff br br filmed in vibrant technicolor 'elena and her men' looks terrific as well a flurry of bright colours characters and costumes bergman's polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self absorbed not in an unlikable way but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions she is persuaded by a team of bumbling government conspirators to convince general rollan to stage a coup d'Ã©tat knowingly exploiting his love for her in order to satisfy her own delusions as a guardian angel perhaps the film's only legitimately virtuous character is henri de chevincourt mel ferrer then audrey hepburn's husband who ignores everybody else's selfish secondary motives and pursues elena for love and love alone this renoir proudly suggests is what the true french do best 'elena and her men' also attempts with moderate success to expose the superficiality of upper class french liaisons through the clumsy philandering of eugÃ¨ne jacques jouanneau who can't make love to his servant mistress without his fiancÃ¨ walking in on them for these sequences renoir was obviously trying for the madcap sort of humour that you might find in a marx brothers film but the film itself is so relaxed and laid back that the energy just isn't there
