<START> i have nothing to comment on this movie it is so bad that i had to put my first comment on imdb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting instead of watching this movie anything will do even stare at the walls is better br br and because i have to write minimum 10 lines of text i tell you also is a low budget movie bad acting no name actors a stupid mutt as the wolf and so on also the story brings nothing new the special effects are made in the 80's style br br the movie is almost as bad as the movie megalodon br br so have fun not watching this movie
<START> man with the gun is pretty much forgotten now but caused a minor storm of media interest back in 1955 when robert mitchum turned down both jett rink in giant which had actually been written for him and which was subsequently substantially reworked and charles laughton's intended version of the naked and the dead to make it instead despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that occasionally renders both mitch and jan sterling in unflattering tones it's a terrific dark western that more than stands comparison with his earlier blood on the moon as his 'town tamer' sets to work on a town that never had the chance to grow up before getting run down by the local badmen before turning out to Â possibly Â be almost as bad as the men he dispatches certainly his way of dealing with news of a death in the family Â burning a saloon to the ground and goading its manager into trying to kill him Â doesn't inspire much confidence in his stability as well as a good script and a surprisingly good supporting turn from the usually irritating but here well cast henry hull it also boasts a strikingly good early alex north score which even includes an early workout for one of his tormented emotional cues that would later turn up in spartacus
<START> blood castle aka scream of the demon lover altar of blood ivanna the best but least exploitation cinema sounding title and so on is a very traditional gothic romance film that means that it has big creepy castles a headstrong young woman a mysterious older man hints of horror and the supernatural and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term it also means that it is very deliberately paced and that the film will work best for horror mavens who are big fans of understatement if you love films like robert wise's the haunting 1963 but you also have a taste for late 1960s early 1970s spanish and italian horror you may love blood castle as well br br baron janos dalmar carlos quiney lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional unspecified european village the locals fear him because legend has it that whenever he beds a woman she soon after ends up dead the consensus is that he sets his ferocious dogs on them this is quite a problem because the baron has a very healthy appetite for women at the beginning of the film yet another woman has turned up dead and mutilated br br meanwhile dr ivanna rakowsky erna schÃ¼rer has appeared in the center of the village asking to be taken to baron dalmar's castle she's an out of towner who has been hired by the baron for her expertise in chemistry of course no one wants to go near the castle finally ivanna finds a shady individual who becomes even shadier to take her once there an odd woman who lives in the castle olga cristiana galloni rejects ivanna and says that she shouldn't be there since she's a woman baron dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay she ends up staying but somewhat reluctantly the baron has hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns which the baron's brother igor is suffering from br br unfortunately the baron's brother appears to be just a lump of decomposing flesh in a vat of bizarre blackish liquid and furthermore ivanna is having bizarre hallucinatory dreams just what is going on at the castle is the baron responsible for the crimes is he insane br br i wanted to like blood castle more than i did as i mentioned the film is very deliberate in its pacing and most of it is very understated i can go either way on material like that i don't care for the haunting yes i'm in a very small minority there but i'm a big fan of 1960s and 1970s european horror one of my favorite directors is mario bava i also love dario argento's work from that period but occasionally blood castle moved a bit too slow for me at times there are large chunks that amount to scenes of not very exciting talking alternated with scenes of ivanna slowly walking the corridors of the castle br br but the atmosphere of the film is decent director josÃ© luis merino managed more than passable sets and locations and they're shot fairly well by emanuele di cola however blood castle feels relatively low budget and this is a roger corman produced film after all which usually means a low budget though often surprisingly high quality quickie so while there is a hint of the lushness of bava's colors and complex set decoration everything is much more minimalist of course it doesn't help that the retromedia print i watched looks like a 30 year old photograph that's been left out in the sun too long it appears washed out with compromised contrast br br still merino and di cola occasionally set up fantastic visuals for example a scene of ivanna walking in a darkened hallway that's shot from an exaggerated angle and where an important plot element is revealed through shadows on a wall only there are also a couple ingmar bergmanesque shots where actors are exquisitely blocked to imply complex relationships besides just being visually attractive and pulling your eye deep into the frame br br the performances are fairly good and the women especially schÃ¼rer are very attractive merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity schÃ¼rer went on to do a number of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were other genres with english titles such as sex life in a woman's prison 1974 naked and lustful 1974 strip nude for your killer 1975 and erotic exploits of a sexy seducer 1977 blood castle is much tamer but in addition to the nudity there are still mild scenes suggesting rape and bondage and of course the scenes mixing sex and death br br the primary attraction here though is probably the story which is much a slow burning romance as anything else the horror elements the mystery elements and a somewhat unexpected twist near the end are bonuses but in the end blood castle is a love story about a couple overcoming various difficulties and antagonisms often with physical threats or harms to be together
<START> look it's the third one so you already know it's bad and maniac cop wasn't good enough to warrant the second installment so you know it's even worse but how much worse awful approaching god awful br br when maniac cop goes on a killing spree a reporter exclaims what happened here can only be described as a black rainbow of death br br 1 rainbows are not black and can never be 2 rainbows are harmless and can never inflict pain or death 3 a news reporter one valuable to his agency might find another way to describe the aftermath of a killing spree a black rainbow of death is not the only way to describe the given situation br br this is what you're in for
<START> having seen the peter o'toole version recently i was ready to be awed by the smart writing in this version little time is spent on the fighting which i prefer instead we are shown all the many motives underlying both the french and english who held normandy politicos and priests who put her to death even the worst hypocrite of them all the archbishop leaves us with the thought that of course she was innocent the innocent have always had to suffer for the ambitions of the mighty she had no idea what she was saying no idea of the implications of blasphemy or going against the church unschooled she had no idea of what the church's stand on such matters even was br br preminger was true to the myths surrounding her death and i appreciated the preview on the tape that showed the flames reaching up and burning her why they used gas jets in the movie and 2 of them were stopped up suddenly the air pressure blew out the stoppage and the flames leaped up right on her thankfully for her they didn't have to repeat the shot as it was so realistic she was being burned pretty traumatic introduction for an iowa girl to her new career of acting br br john gielgud performed outstandingly he is the english politico who is orchestrating the show he also makes the point that once you condemn someone to death you don't want to be around to watch them die you might shrink from your 'duty' the next time not that such delicacies bother the soul of our would be president we christians even the most anti semitic have no problem with falling back on the old testament when it comes to capital punishment even though it was overridden by jesus' words bring on public executions like this little girl's smelling burnt flesh might bring us respectable folks to our souls' senses br br the only little 'pick' i have about this film is that we are not shown why the priest who has been so adamantly urging her burning becomes so suddenly so contrite even to the point of madness there should have been more expansion of his character more dialogue as the sudden 'coming to his senses' doesn't make sense br br and whether graham greene does this deliberately or not st joan is such a self assured little upstart you almost but not quite are glad she meets her come uppance and when she turned down life in prison for some reason i thought of anne sexton the poet who accused sylvia plath of 'stealing her death' when she committed suicide knowing such an action guarantees immortality you gotta wonder br br if ever there was a good example of obsessive thought and logic tight compartments this is one st joan should have turned buddhist and quieted the 'voices in her mind'
<START> i remember seeing this years ago when it first came out and i was floored by parker posey's performance and the movie was pretty good also for anyone who's spent a little too much time in the nightclub after hours scene this movie will have a special charm for you not too serious mostly funny and parker posey definitely blazes her talented way through this indie gem br br i especially liked the diaz character reminded me of every single struggling dj i've ever known and many other movies could take a cue from this movie on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and bland about it br br babaganoosh
<START> this third pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain older kids the message of the film about dealing with loss is subverted by the return of the young girl's father during the film's credits team rocket provide some amusement but they're not really part of the small plot so they don't appear very often
<START> tis is a farly typical tom and jerry short a situation is designed conflict arises and mayhem ensues the characters behave in appropriate ways the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos the best and funniest part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes a word of warning it is most unwise to allow tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine highly recommended
<START> this film has special effects which for it's time are very impressive some if it is easily explainable with the scenes played backwards but the overlay of moving images on an object on film is surprisingly well done given that this film was made more than 94 years ago
<START> there is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn't help with the major downsides to the movie i never understand why directors ask actors actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can't convince fiennes just can't do irish and fitzgerald isn't much better at russian when the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing as the for the major problem the plot was there one i guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that i just couldn't wait for the film to end it was ridiculous save 90 minutes of your life and don't watch this movie
<START> i am starting this review with a big giant spoiler about this film do not read further here it comes avert your eyes the main heroine the girl who always survives in other slasher films is murdered here there i just saved you 79 minutes of your life br br this is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the '80's despite killing the heroine off this is just substandard junk br br both priests and college students get a bad rap here they are pictured as oversexed sociopathic morons who have way too many internal problems to deal with what looks like junior college campus life and the college students come off even worse br br splatter university is just gunk to put in your vcr when you have nothing better to do although i suggest watching your head cleaner tape that would be more entertaining br br this is rated r for strong physical violence gore profanity very brief female nudity and sexual references br br

<START> start of with the good bit several times swayze talks zulu to his friends or that language is heard among the tribes that's a great plus as normally usa uk movie audiences think all people on this planet speak english just in case you're one of them no they don't br br but the acting is 'tenenkrommend' as we say in the netherlands it makes your toes curl and not in a good way i like swayze but in this he's awful the muscles in his jaws make overtime and he's frowning the whole movie some one must have told him it looks butch no patrick it looks silly and is compensation for lack of character alison doody elizabeth has opted for a style of acting that does not meet the style of her co workers her acting is sÃ³ relaxed that this movie could have been set in the current days and it's not your frock was a clue alison br br the best acting came from the people from the african continent and sided onyulo as umbopa i liked best clear warm and in character his performance is a joy to watch br br general it is mwah entertaining on a rainy day pity could have been better sack the director
<START> when you come across a gem of a movie like this you realize why the '80s were the greatest decade to live thru the rock music ruled so did movies especially horror movies filmmakers knew how to entertain us trick or treat is evident to this when rocker sammi curr who was most likely written after w a s p singer blackie lawless dies in a hotel fire his 1 fan eddie is distraught he goes to friend local dj nuke gene simmons for support nuke gives him a copy of the very last recording that sammi made this is the only copy available it was given to the radio station to be played live halloween night when eddie plays it it somehow brings back sammi he helps eddie with the bullies at school but then goes out of control it is definitely one great movie the bad thing is this movie is out of print i paid 25 00 to finally get it off of ebay you should too well spent
<START> hak hap black mask is what i'd like to call a ballet with fists and explosions sure the plot has been tried and heard before a biologically engineered soldier that is part of a elite fighting force of supermen that decides he feels that killing and brute force aren't the ways to settle every thing and becomes a pacifist and a librarian but when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by taking on the police his best friend is a cop he becomes the black mask the style that the movie goes for very visual works and at least for me is entertaining i love martial arts movies that are a spectical people flying around lighter than air and recovering a split second after impact keeps the pace and action non stop but that is what this movie is about anyway right a showcase of jet li doing what he does best and that is spectacular showmanship of his skills which to say the least are top notch as with most of the fast action martial arts movies ala jackie chan and sammo hung that are just now showing themselves here in the states for the first time these movies are low on plot and high on amazing physical feats but i must say even with the large holes left in the plot like how do we see him safe in his apartment when just one scene before he had 20 men that are no more than 15 feet from him with sign of escape who knows the scene just cuts to him in the apartment ohh well suspension of belief i guess the movie to me stays interesting it is only until the last 20 minutes that the film seems to feel like it could have been a little shorter but still all around a great high paced action movie
<START> caught this film at the arizona international film festival i wasn't expecting a lot though the festival's director told me it was one of the best films submitted five minutes into it i was sold shot in b w on a shoestring budget this film is hilarious the acting is solid the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid the acting is probably the biggest revelation since most films shot on low budgets tend to have amateur or stagey acting not this one it features one of the most convincing endearing and funny portrayals of a character with tourette's syndrome i've ever seen the plot is convoluted without being confusing and raunchy without being gratuitous if you get the chance see this movie filmmakers like majkowski hope i got that right deserve the chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience
<START> note to all mad scientists everywhere if you're going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster you need to give him a scarier name than paul i don't care if he's a frightening hammerhead shark with a mouthful of dagger sharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water as well as on dry land give the kid a more worthy name like thor rock or tiburon because even if he eats me up i will probably just sit there laughing ha get a load of this paul the monster is ripping me to shreds that's the worst part about this movie is this shark thing is referred to as paul throughout the entire flick it makes what could have been a decent scary horror movie just seem silly not that there aren't other campy and contrived parts of hammerhead shark frenzy the scientists spend the entire movie wandering along this island and all of a sudden one of the girls starts itching madly from walking in the lush forest and just has to pour water on her feet to relive the itching which of course allows paul to come out of the water and kill her the one thing scifi channel did right in this movie was let the hottie live but that's a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie
<START> and after seeing this pile of crap you won't be surprised that it wasn't published br br spoilers br br this is a terrible movie by any standards but when i point out that it's one of the worst movies that has the name stephen king in the credits you can start to imagine how bad it is the movie starts of with two characters staring open mouthed at a scene of horror br br my god what happened here br br i don't know but they sure hate cats br br the camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are strung up dead and mutilated boy this guy is right someone does hate cats and with a deduction like that he should be a policeman oh wait a minute he is a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop making an oh so obvious observation you just know you're going to be watching a bad movie br br the reason sleepwalkers is bad is that it's very illogical and confused we eventually find out the monsters of the title need the blood of virgins to survive would they not be better looking for a virgin in the mid west bible belt rather than an american coastal town having said that at least we know of the monsters motives that's the only thing we learn we never learn how they're able to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from the terminator monster mother walks around killing several cops with her bare hands or blowing them up via a police issue hand gun but if her monster breed is immune from police fire power then why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible the demise of the creatures is equally ill thought out as there killed by a mass attack of household cats if they can be killed by cats then why did the monsters not kill all the cats that were lying around the garden there was a whole horde of moggies sitting around but the monsters never thought about killing them i guess that's so the production team can come up with an ending it was that they started the movie my complaint lies br br we're treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like john landis clive barker and even stephen king make cameos i think the reason for this is because whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script they instantly decided that no matter what they weren't going to appear in a movie this bad so stephen king had to phone up his horror buddies in order to fill out the cast that's how bad sleepwalkers is br br unbelievable as it seems that wasn't the worst line in the movie the worst line is that cat saved my life
<START> truly shows that hype is not everything shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife amitabh as always is solid ajay devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke the leading lady is such a waste of an actor such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry with movies as such i have decreased the amount of bollywood movies i watch br br rgv has been making very crappy movies for a while now time to get different actors hrithek anyone bollywood needs madhuri and kajol back every other leading lady is a half naked wanna be pffffft
<START> i watched the babysitter as part of bci eclipse' drive in cult classics featuring crown international pictures releases on dvd i think it is a very good film br br this movie packs a lot of story into a very short time you have hippies rock music bikers lesbians sexual impropriety blackmail and murder all in one spot br br the lead actors do a credible job and i found the intricately woven plot to be believable and interesting br br however the supporting cast primarily the bikers delivers a stilted performance particularly when asked to deliver lines with more than just a few words perhaps they used real bikers instead of actors a couple of the characters in particular were exceptionally believable br br the musical score is absolutely spot on for the times the tempo and for moving the story forward i found the music a real treat i noticed in the opening credits that the movie featured the music of the food i googled them but couldn't find anything br br in any case george e carey who wrote produced and starred in this movie liked the idea so much of a wayward married man brought to redemption through trials and tribulation and a little help of course that he wrote produced and starred in weekend with the babysitter
