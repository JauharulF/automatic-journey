<START> i thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part since i am a filmmaker i give it a 2 for consistency br br the problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most if not all previous successful war stories the computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story i was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with but did not find that information br br it seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged the actors weren't bad but the plot needs more innovation
<START> punctuating the opening credits sequence is a swarthy man having a strange all too real nightmare closing in on its dystopic 2054 paris the film begins to follow a woman into a grungy club where she and a slavic bartender convene outside on the deck they toss exclamations at each other to the effect that she owes him more money although she believes she's paid it all another woman obstructs the budding violence only to have a bitter fight with the woman herself the initial woman storms out and she is kidnapped christian volckman's renaissance appears to be another one in an assembly line of recent motion capture animated sci fi noir pictures but in spite of whether or not that is essentially true it tells a neatly arranged classically unraveling detective story that keeps us in the dark in its opening minutes even whilst introducing karas the hard boiled cop we recognize from the beginning as the man awakening from a terrible dream br br the rudiments of classic film noir are all hit upon without any anachronistic changes for all intents and purposes it is in the harshness of its monochrome that volckman's french thriller has followed no example for the film's animators unfettered by the challenges of physical lighting that would normally be faced have been able to begin with a totally black frame and to affix utter pitch white according to the action on screen as they scrupulously imitate the effects of real light sources throughout the frame the distinction of black and white here is full blown without even any of the slightest shades of gray to tone with the characters' less starkly definite moral codes and the outcome is a harsh and judgmental vision of the direction in which commercial civilization is going sporadically caused to undergo the most blaring and ruthless of illumination it is the artistic study of film noir taken to their visual boundary of its philosophy and nothing before has ever shared quite the same execution of this visual concept br br all the characters in this decent cyberpunk film seem as if to have been walk off with purely from a gothic comic book in black ink but all together their physical responses their motions and the nuances of their facial expressions look ashore within a clear humanity normally films that try out new developments in animation allow their technical advances upstage all other facets of production sin city for example left substance and overall good screen adaptation from its source material to be desired br br it may not be mind blowing it may have its narrative conventions and its voice over cast may simply be adequate but renaissance made for 19 million over six years not only feels like actual noir instead of a rashly penned appropriation but also is not secondary to all the visual innovation which is played as if to be incidental one leaves thinking not so much about how cool it is when karas is evading bullets shot through a crowded glass parisian street but more about its ponderance of life and death how life's tragedies such as death make life meaningful
<START> sometimes you have to look back to go forward the 60's did just that we need to remember the past the past is part of the future br br great mix gary j coppola i see a great future you deserve to be nominated and win the 60's best mixer of the year br br best mini series of all times br br thanks ursula br br
<START> i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating's some people have given it it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated now if you don't like comic books or animation then of course you won't like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me though if you are a fan of interesting strong characters and heroic sexy women kicking butt and saving the world hell you will love this movie i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie quite anime esque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation like titan a e meet's the live action version of punisher in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie
<START> great actors an oscar nominee actress stunning scenery good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag and thats quite big this film was brilliant it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were well side splitting i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the 'stoned ladies in the tea shop' scene well done to the british film industry and to craig ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year if not of all time
<START> ok so a 10 for a 2 1 2 star movie you ask well see this one and maybe it will make more sense hitchcock never blended scenes together better the film weaves scenes together flawlessly from the start and yet you don't get that scattered feeling you sometimes get when a movie runs you through the many characters it attempts to develop you sense that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves and then they don't disappoint you when they do screenwriter producer phil hay's surreal tale of life blended with an absolutely superb soundtrack makes you think more about the 6 degrees of separation in life than the movie by the same title i will be looking for more good things from this producer in the future
<START> this mini does not get better with age i saw this and it's sequel when originally broadcast and like so many others was blown away in early 2002 i borrowed the novels for both wow and w and r and was even more impressed i then decided that i had to see both again and invested 200 plus on the dvd sets i watched both minis again in painful detail and realized i had done things backwards i should have purchased the novels and borrowed the dvd's br br don't believe it is abysmally miscast read the novels and see for yourself don't think this is dated screen it for somebody not old enough to have seen it originally broadcast and watch the reaction you get warning reactions from such people range from looks of horror to belly laughs br br according to the trivia section for this mini dan curtis himself chose ali macgraw and robert mitchum yikes production quality music scoring dialog a great story was turned into a late 70's soap opera by an overly ambitious producer director who was in way over his head this thing was dated the minute it was completed br br these two minis were great when original broadcast and to those of us who saw them then tug at a nostalgic string that reminds us of younger days imo this mini does not nearly live up to its reputation and severely disappoints
<START> the first and only time i saw the woman in black was i think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on tv back in 1989 it was christmas eve and my father and i were watching it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church i was quite young at the time but i'm not sure who was more terrified walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night me or my father br br there are many factors about this film that make it so creepy but i think 0ne of them is the fact that there's not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of nearly every hollywood movie so every creak thump and bang is more amplified in your head as there's no distraction another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories there's no jump factor involved like things bouncing out the closet so it makes it not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on this is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running riot thinking whats around the corner or behind the door br br a superb ghost story i've never seen anything that can match it and with all the dross thats repeated over and over on tv i cant believe the bbc has deleted it after to my knowledge only one showing
<START> i had just reached thirteen when i first saw this series and i am watching it again on dvd over thirty years later the pictures over the opening credits have never left me it has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it my parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me and we always discussed the programme afterwards it gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks i got in our school's public exams br br sir laurence olivier's voice and delivery is timeless and perfect i get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the second world war i cannot imagine ever getting bored looking at it maybe an similar cold war series could now be contemplated although who could replace sir laurence is difficult to imagine br br buy it
<START> clint eastwood reprises his role as dirty harry who this time is on the case of a vigilante sondra locke who is killing the people that raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action then talk not that i'm complaining sudden impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment
<START> i rented this for my son who is recently found interest in 9 11 he was a kindergartener at the time and had no idea what was unfolding i liked the way it was told as a documentary if there was one movie that i would recommend to see concerning 9 11 this would be the one normally you see a movie it has actors that are well known this movie had nobody known also you see a movie concerning 9 11 you hear about a fire fighter or two losing their lives saving people i didn't feel this had any of that i only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection very well done indeed my heart goes out to the survivors and families of victims of 9 11
<START> movies like this one and c r a z y make me very sad for american films with a gay subject matter with the exception of parting glances and brokeback mountain there are few other notable american films with the kind of depth and sincerity as this movie the bubble this movie centers on two men noam and ashwar an israle and palestinian respectively their relationship is complicated by the tension between the jews and arabs in israel couples in the early stages of their relationships will struggle with who will call who next or who will say i love you first noam and ashwar's early love is complicated by suicide bombings armed security check points and racism while noam's friends accept and like ashwar who is arab it is clear that most of tel aviv's citizens probably don't br br one of the most touching moments and there are many in this film is when noam and ashwar attend a production of bent we as movie goers see them watching this play and the affect it has on the two of them is profoundly captured in their eyes and ultimately this touching moment is played out in a very sad way in the finale of the movie br br ohad knoller and youseff 'joe' sweid are outstanding as noam and ashwar director eytan fox is brilliant in creating a cogent and interesting retelling of the shakespeare classic romeo and juliet and while most movies today have sex in them almost as a sport this one goes back to the old tried and true version of sex with love and passion combined it is so refreshing also refreshing is seeing two gay men being portrayed as people and not cartoons there are cartoonish characters in this movie it just doesn't happen to be the two gay guys for a change somewhere on this site i think i read a comparison between this movie and friends well not really yes these are youthful characters stumbling through their first uneasy steps into adulthood and relationships but i don't recall getting blowed up as a backdrop to the insipid story lines in friends br br this is a very good movie it has heart and heartbreak and like all good love stories love does win out but not in it's intact glory of full bloom still it's a very satisfying movie to watch
<START> that's pretty ridiculous i hope many people are exposed to muslims who live all over the u s u k and all over the world the religion has over a billion followers i myself born and bread in america and through my religious classes and teachings i have been taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to the society i am very dedicated to the followings and teachings of my religion have been stressed through out life to educate and prepare oneself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world i have know many muslims from all over and i have traveled to countries like pakistan i have yet to meet one person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the media i wonder why also its sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion its a religion of one billion people and these are less than one percent i am sure the other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the kkk ira and many more which are simple small percentage extremists who use outdated and not literal passages from the respected books in order to pursue their own revenge personal or business matters through their so called religion
<START> 'the student of prague' is an early feature length horror drama or rather it is an autorenfilm i e an author's film this film is a member of a movement of many movements that tried to lend respectability to cinÃ©ma or just make a profit by adapting literature or theatre onto the screen fortunately the story of this book with moving pictures is good using alfred de musset's poem and a story by edgar allen poe it centres on the doppelgÃ¤nger theme br br unfortunately the most cinematic this film gets is the double exposure effects to make paul wegener appear twice within scenes guido seeber was a special effects wizard for his day but he's not very good at positioning the camera or moving it film scholar leon hunt printed in early cinema space frame narrative however has made an interesting analysis on this film using framing to amplify the doubles theme characters being split by left right near far and frontal diagonal framing of characters and shots regardless the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position which is noticeably primitive worse is the lack of editing there's very little scene dissection and scenes linger none of this is unusual for 1913 but there were more advanced films in this respect around the same time including the better parts of 'atlantis' august blom 1913 'twilight of a woman's soul' yevgeni bauer 1913 and the short films of d w griffith br br an expanded universal film vocabulary by 1926 would allow for a vastly superior remake furthermore the remake has a reason for the lyduschka character other than being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate here the obtrusively acted gypsy lurks around seemingly with a cloak of invisibility i know their world is silent to me but i assume with their lips moving and such that their world would not be silent to them so how can lyduschka leer over others' shoulders and not be noticed br br nevertheless this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually wegener who seems to have been the primary mind behind this film in addition to playing the lead would later play the title role and co direct 'the golem' in 1920 helping to further inaugurate the supernatural thread in german silent cinÃ©ma br br note the first version i viewed was about an hour long surely not quite complete and was in poor condition with faces bleached at times and such i'm not sure who was the distributor i've also since seen the alpha dvd which at 41 minutes is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards but is visually not as bad the repetitive score is best muted though
<START> having previously seen the abridged print presented by david shepard i finally got a hold of a complete or nearer complete version which was about 56 minutes compared to the 30 minute version more widely distributed the shepard print for image entertainment is certainly of superior quality and the best parts are there but it's nonetheless good to see the rest of the film and fill in some loose story ends br br in the shepard print the film ends with mary stating you see i've changed my mind i'm never going home yet in the complete version mary and kenneth driscoll end their relationship soon after that scene Â mary returns home to the country Â and driscoll rekindles his relationship with vivian this additional footage develops the character vivian who had little relevance in the shepard version moreover in the complete version the film begins in the new jersey countryside with mary where she reads and fantasizes about her ideal lover she's disappointed by the reality of the advances by farm chore boy johnny applebloom a character completely absent from the shepard version but after her affair with driscoll she returns to the country to presumably and eventually become a farmer's wife br br regardless of the print 'a girl's folly' is a good little film for 1917 made by one of the top directors of the 1910s maurice tourneur in it tourneur takes plenty of jabs at his own business including by playing a caricature of himself the director of the film within the film the two leads also give quality performances by early screen acting standards robert warwick an actor playing a skirt chasing star and doris kenyon as an ingÃ©nue aspiring to play an ingÃ©nue on the screen br br self referential films which made film making the focus of the films were nothing new by now mack sennett had already parodied this type of film three years prior with 'mabel's dramatic career' several aspects of this one stand out though frances marion's intertitles are humorous including illustrations of the actors on a chessboard with a hand directing them remarkable for 1917 i especially liked the film's final title cards where two observers remark on the film's happy ending gee but ain't that romantick and the other replies romance nuthin Â that's movin' pictures fellow female screenwriter anita loos made a similar self referential conclusion to another film from 1917 'wild and woolly' both writers helped change the role of their professions in the business and art br br some of the photography by tourneur and john van den broek is good especially concerning the film making business the use of mirrors in several scenes is a nice reinforcement of the film's self reflexivity furthermore the editing is exceptional the quick crosscutting during the studio scenes is especially salient it serves to punctuate the hectic pace filmmakers work at especially back then
<START> there's nothing new here all the standard romantic comedy scenes even down to the taxi sprinting to the airport to stop the woman flying away the only thing that saves this is the acting of alison eastwood some of the minor characters blink and you'll miss gabrielle anwar who obviously had some fun br br turn it off when the pair are in bliss and you won't have to go through the inevitable plot pain
<START> i really have to disagree with guy yardley rees who should he have watched the entire film would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery some of the best ever shot in skye and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant whole br br this is not a big budget film rather it is a film that has a strong community feel br br i can't say how much 'standard' films bore me pushing out the same polished stuff again and again seachd doesn't seem to be about that at all it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish film br br ok so the acting isn't in the style a blockbuster that's because the actors are seemingly real people i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing and at times unusually beautiful br br seachd really bears a second viewing since there are many threads that become clearer second time around that really do feed into the ending br br overall the combination of music and at times stunning visuals plus a community approach to the acting and non normal structure has turned seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film more of these please
<START> kimi wa petto is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is outside her apartment one day she decides to bring him in and fix his cuts she then leaves a note for him to eats some food she made then go home because she had to go to work when she gets home however she finds that he is still there he tells her that he wants to live there with her like a brother or cousin in desperation to get him to leave she tells him that if he became her pet then he could stay and as a pet she says that he would have no rights and do whatever she told him not in that perverted way to her surprise he agrees and from then on he is known as momo her pet
<START> frailty 8 10 it's non sensical title and bill paxton directs headline aside this is a pretty good old fashioned rip snorting biblical horror thriller in the end it may end up only being the inbred southern gothic cousin of kubrick's the shining but hey that's a pretty damn entertaining notion it's also got a doozy of a plot twist and a very ambiguous moral message this is the kind of movie that years from now people will catch late at night on basic cable and scare the beejesus out of themselves watching it too bad director bill paxton had to go hire himself to star oh well still a devil of a good rent
<START> i loved it fred macmurray is wonderful as skid johnson a somewhat conceited proud yet at the same time very vulnerable saxophone player who is in love with maggie carole lombard who's always there for him they meet in panama after maggie comes off a ship and end up in a bar with anthony quinn tony gets punched in the nose after her insults maggie by thinking her a loose woman all because she took off her hat in public big brawl and maggie ends up stuck in panama romance carole and arthur are great together maggie is always there for him whenever he needs her she urges him to go to ny where well watch the movie and find out they have these wonderful scenes together where she sings in his arms while he plays the saxophone i definitely recommend it
