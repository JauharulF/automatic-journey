<START> oh dear oh dear br br for jm fans this was the nail in the coffin as far as her a list hollywood career was concerned after solid turns in girl can't help it wayward bus the burglar and rock hunter it seemed jayne was well on the way to becoming one of tinsel town's hottest stars however an obsession with racy publicity and an appearance in this clunker relegated mansfield to the sidelines namely cheap euro loan outs until fox could drop her contract at the earliest opportunity br br this movie really is a diabolical waste of everyone's time with the exception of suzy parker who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material many people blame poor jayne and her grating performance for this film's poor returns at the box office and while she is a pain in this film she can only do her best with the material after all cary hardly sets the screen on fire does he after a handful of very good dramatic and comedy turns jayne takes 10 steps back in her pursuit as a serious actress by agreeing simply for the sake of appearing with grant to portray this squealing idiotic menace her character of alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit her every appearance in the film jangles your nerves we all know jayne could do so much better than this dross and yet here she is parading around like a prize pudding a real shame br br steer clear of this so called comedy it's more depressing than funny
<START> even though the plot was very well detailed and the story line was understandable the fact that steven seagals voice was dubbed with some one else's through out most of the movie was distressing as you were unsure who was talking there were many parts where he would start to talk in his deep raspy voice and then the next some one else's voice was doing the talking for him i don't know the reason however if he had difficulty with his voice during production of the movie i think they could have re shot the events that did not contain his own voice when he had recovered i have rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the film when one pays for a movie whether or not its at the theater or on dvd this movie was not worth the admission price that was charged i have been a long time follower of steven seagal and all his movies that he has done over the past years to date i think this is one of the worst ones we have seen yet
<START> after an initial release of 4 very good eurotrash titles redemption has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with the bloodsucker leads the dance i found no bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie br br the story is simple a mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation after some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one who is the killer who knows there are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on friday br br the pace is excruciating the story is silly and the skin scenes aren't all that terrific either br br give this one a miss
<START> wooshÂ manÂ what can i say br br the opening scene maybe we see a bunch of mongoloid barbarians with bad make up jump off the walls of some ruins they sneak around and attack some dude with a scantily clothed captive girl the dude runs off the mongoloids follow him and one of them stays behind seemingly to rape the girl but instead he exposes one of her breasts and kidnaps her then the dude still on the run sees a horse and tries to steal it suddenlyÂ a blond god like looking hero with a bad wig appears saying that's my horse the mighty deathstalker just made his appearance the mongoloids arrive deathstalker kills all of them including the dude on the tunes of some rather inappropriate mexicanos western score this is supposed to be a swords sorcery flick so what's with the 'arriba trompettos' and then goes up to captive girl and exposes both her breasts he starts to rub them and captive girl seems to like it she starts liking her lips and caressing deathstalker just when they are about to get down to it this old dude appears interrupting what could have been the end of a perfect day for deathstalker and a possible perfect ending for a short film br br now tell meÂ isn't that the point where either a feminist would angrily switch off the movie or any other male viewer would say this is going to be one hell of a good movie the plot is as simple as throwing a kitten from the balcony deathstalker must obtain the sword of justice and use it to steal the amulet of life and the chalice of magic from the evil sorcerer munkar br br aside from decapitations dismemberment random bloodshed retarded fist fights and embarrassing sword fights this film also contains a massive amount of t ts a shots i initially wanted to add one extra point to this movie for each gratuitous shot of naked boobies i could count after 9 points not even halfway into the movie i had to give up counting it was distracting me from the rest of the movie and the rest of the movie was worth it totally crazy stuff check out this mutant cat worm like creature munkar has as a pet and which he feeds eyeballs and fingers and here's an interesting question what would you do if a man in a woman's body would enter your bedroom and try to kill you with a knife the answer is simple you slap him around a bit take away the knife and then try to rape him then you discover that he's actually not a woman so you throw him out of your bed and tell him to leave your room it works out well i tell you deathstalker does it too and the deathstalker way is the right way br br deathstalker is a wonderful movie really as pointed out in other comments the villains are vile the women are delicious there's blood sex violence rape and tasty chicken there's a completely pointless tournament which just features a bunch of barbarians beating slashing and hacking the crap out of each other my favorite weapon used in that tournament was a giant wooden hammer used to beat a poor contender to bloody pulp and my favorite contender undoubtedly was that one brute with the warthog head reminiscent of the gamorrean guards from return of the jedi i won't reveal how the movie ends but just prepare to ravish in delight when i tell you a 4 way dismemberment is thrown into the movie's climax br br and of course there's a wonderful display of ineptitude throughout the whole movie see a guy being dragged behind a horse over a dirt road and the next point of view shot shows him being dragged over grass no road see that awesome tattoo on the sorcerer's head magically change sides within the same scene on shot has it on the left side of his head the other on the right well after all munkar is a magician it's that or this movie was shot in an alternate universe where things like continuity simply don't exist br br as much as i enjoyed this and as much as i am looking forward to the other 3 installments in this series i do have enough shreds of decency left in me to not let this movie pass i am prepared though to give it the maximum amount of minimal points just so i could be able to deduct a couple of more points for the possibly inferior sequels to follow deathstalker might be a superbly fun trashy sleazy conan rip off it also is an abominable movie
<START> i had really only been exposed to olivier's dramatic performances and those were mostly much later films than divorce in this film he is disarmed of his pomp and overconfidence by sassy merle oberon and plays the flustered divorce attorney with great charm
<START> i usually don't walk out of a movie but halfway thru i did this movie promised something different but i kept thinking haven't i seen that before spoiler alert back in 1 the spaceship crashes and lands on earth well all these years later with a super adult on board no less this thing still manages to burn up and crash what this advanced civilization can't seem to develop landing gear for an industry that's so liberal we get to see another woody allen movie no blacks please superman runs around saving people making sure he sticks to europe and the us don't go into darkie areas please maybe i could stomach this about 30 years ago but now now
<START> the line is funnier in england where away from vixen 's native america the word fanny has a whole new meaning sadly it's the only laugh you'll get in this terrible sex comedy that is neither sexy nor funny br br oddly unalluring with painted on eyebrows erica gavin acting ability zero is a nymphomaniac who lusts after her own brother but rejects his black friend while making derogatory remarks about watermelons as if in revenge he asks her if she would go with a shetland pony reference is also made to making it with monkeys gavin's ability to shake and tremble with orgasmic pleasure at the slightest touch is matched only in it's lack of appeal by her seduction dance Â which involves a bonfire and a haddock personally i preferred the haddock br br for '68 this was pretty tame stuff and belies the controversy it attracted at the time a character claims to be getting stoned though it's only on bourbon and for one of the original x certificates there's no full frontal nudity just six years later we would be getting timmy lea and his confessions but here we have to make do with topless shots only gavin's final seduction of her own brother really shocks another activity for vixen is where she helps settle the sexual problems between a married couple by sleeping with them both the two women clearly aren't enjoying acting out their scene together and make a poor effort to disguise it after vixen irons out their disharmony the romantic husband concludes of his wife i guess she's got it coming to her br br the only near worthwhile segment involves an unusual discussion of cuban communism it seems out of place with the rest of the film though is spliced with shots of gavin's breasts to rope it in to continuity this then leads into a vague anti vietnam stance which is commendable though dropped in the middle of such a frivolous film it seems trite and insensitive not to say downright tasteless incidentally the part of would be communist niles brooke is taken by harrison page the same harrison page who played captain trunk in amusing comedy sledge hammer page must be embarrassed by his back catalogue which also includes meyer's beyond the valley of the dolls though meyer apologists would have you believe the terrible dialogue lousy acting sloppy direction and dire editing are not just part of the charm but wholly intentional as a defence it fails to hold water br br the irritating incidental music Â a cross between the tunes they play in cinema restaurant ads and muzak used by tv stations when the transmission breaks down Â is omnipresent and intrusive while even the silly amateurishly skewed camera angles can't generate interest a wonderful world of jazz saxophones where women have been asking for it black men Â or shines Â aren't good enough for anyone and rape is an acceptable form of revenge absolutely abysmal
<START> a prison cell four prisoners carrere a young company director accused of fraud 35 year old transsexual in the process of his transformation daisy a 20 year old mentally challenged idiot savant and lassalle a 60 year old intellectual who murdered his wife behind a stone slab in the cell mysteriously pulled loose they discovered a book the diary of a former prisoner danvers who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century the diary contains magic formulas that supposedly enable prisoners to escape malefique is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror films i have seen this year the film has a grimy shadowy feel influenced by the works of h p lovecraft which makes for a very creepy and unsettling atmosphere there is a fair amount of gore involved with some imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well developed it's a shame that eric valette made truly horrible remake of one missed call after his stunning debut 9 out of 10
<START> when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film i know it is bad i wanted to claw my eyes out i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately wished to unwatch if only it were possible the other films being 'troll 2' and 'fast and furious' both which are better than this crap in the hat br br i may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget i ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good seuss name br br to mike myers i say stick with austin or even resurrect waynes world just because it worked for jim carrey doesn't mean seuss is a success for all canadians br br
<START> lame cliched superhero action movie drivel i had high hopes for this movie and the genre of hk buddy cop actioneers is one that i don't despise but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was this would have been forgivable as it always is in these kinds of movies when the action compensates unfortunately it did not the action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of hk action but it's not very involving obscenely gory and in fact often completely incoherent perhaps this is due to re editing for american release it does show signs in many places of patchwork i was very disappointed
<START> as i work at a video store i found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies i've ever seen and warn my friends and co workers of it amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the worst movie my friend dared me to watch b t k killer even stating that if i could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the worst movie ever then he'd watch it i lost i believe that even i made better videos than this in high school and those were hardly great feats of a young genius this film not only lacked in what seemed to be production value it looks like it was shot on a bad camcorder although it is surprisingly clear but also in acting wooden hollow and pathetic don't scratch the surface as well as just generally bad movie feeling i can remember a scene where i heard glass smash suddenly i was reminded of some bad high school plays i know that i reference high school too often here but this film did seem very juvenile both in terms of the set which seemed far too fake but also as if the people were reading their lines from the script not entirely sure what was actually going on my review doesn't do this film justice because i can't describe how utterly horrid the time i spent watching this was it's almost ironic that i do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie
<START> i am never a big fan of taiwan movie production as opposed to korean hongkong or even china strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film i don't consider myself as hard to please audience as i am in fact a fan of indie movies however this movie shows weak plot and slow pace i found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going the acting certainly does not make it better rainie's acting is sub par as she 'over act' trying to be perky and cute although i have to admit she is a pleasure to look at isabella leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused sad regretful extremely reserved character overall i find this movie is a disappointment
<START> i was fortunate enough to meet george pal and still have my ds tmob poster autographed by him at a convention shortly after the release and asked him why he chose to do the film camp before he could answer two studio flacks intercepted and lectured me on how the studio knew best and how no one will take such a film seriously i had been reading the bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend comicon attendees of the 1970s will recall blackhawk and his band i was in a couple of years of that with him and had higher hopes than what we got br br the flacks insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously and so doing 'camp' was the only way several other fans jumped in on my side with pal listening as best he could at the end of the little event pal came up to us and apologized wishing he could have done more and better br br star wars put the lie to the flacks and a year after pal's death spielberg and lucas proved that doc savage could have easily been the next major movie franchise if it hadn't been for the flacks br br tear out the memory or history of doc and the film would have been worth a 6 10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn seller br br but destroying the legacy like that was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the crib br br doc savage can still come to the screen and survive the inevitable comparisons by the ill informed to indiana jones but it would have to be done in all seriousness and earnest to reclaim the glory that we should expect from the first american superhero br br sidenotes yes there was a second script for archenemy of evil and it's a lot more serious yes there was simultaneous footage shot but mostly establishing shots and very little with actors and yes there is a one sheet of ron ely leaping over a brick wall and blasting at something over his shoulder with a specially built bronze pistol ely's wearing a duster over a button down white shirt with a bronze tie and the words doc savage archenemy of evil coming next summer postscript if anyone knows who the studio flacks were that accompanied george pal in 1975 to san diego for the convention smack the idiots up the side of the head and call them the idiots that they are at the time they were doing dorkknobs and fu manchu in stripes and baggy canvas pants and carrying paramount portfolios
<START> the fight scenes play like slow motion jackie chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic worst pun by far guess what this time i heard you coming the stars are a mismatched pair brandon lee despite the terrible lines he has to say actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm things that dolph lundgren is completely free of at least in this movie note to the director in the future please stay away from any love scenes especially when your main actress won't do any nudity and you have to rely extensively on a body double 1 2
<START> this is another one of those 'humans vs insects eco horror' features a theme that was popular in the late 70's only you can't really call it horror there's zero suspense and no gruesome events in other words this movie is pretty lame it's not that it's really bad or something it's just very boring a construction site near a hotel uncovers a big nest of ants later on we learn that probably due to different sorts of pesticides used in the past their bite became poisonous some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out what's going on robert foxworth figures it out first and then you can see him go berserk with a digging machine for what seems like several hours then they flee in the house waiting to get rescued and man you should see all the efforts they make for rescuing them i won't spoil too much but at one point they even use a big helicopter all the time when i was watching this i sat there thinking come on people you all got shoes on just run out of the building i'm sure a bunch of ants won't catch up with you it's all pretty ridiculous br br of course lots of close ups of crawling ants are shown throughout the whole movie ants in the garden ants in the garbage ants in the kitchen ants on the roof ants in the bedroom ants in the sink and the best part ants crawling on people's faces while the actors are breathing through straws but when you see groups of ants in wider shots they indeed look like black rice the set designers glued to the wall br br one small surprise came near the end no it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot it was just that brian dennehy made an appearance as a chief fireman ehrr what more can i say this movie is called it happened at lakewood manor but the box art of my copy read ants and the title during the opening credits was panic at lakewood manor there you have it now since this is a made for tv movie from the 70's i'll be once again extremely mild in my final rating now the savage bees another 'humans vs insects' tv movie from 1976 was much better than this one i even feel i have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ants lacking suspense action thrills shocks and creepiness the only thing you'll be left with after seeing ants is an annoying itch
<START> first what i didn't like the acting was not really up to the hamlet standard branagh was really over the top doing a lot of yelling mostly in my opinion those actors who were not big name celebrities generally did a better job though i would except billy crystal and robin williams and charlton heston too but i wasn't sure if he was playing at being a hack a lot of the ambiguities in the play were clearly resolved one way in the flashbacks br br what i think speaks very much in this play's favor is that it is accessible shakespeare is hard to understand for the vast majority of people nowadays many people are not even inclined to try because of its reputation as serious literature and its archaic english if they see this film they will understand clearly at least one man's interpretation of the play they will be seeing it more as shakespeare's audiences saw it a play with sword fights and battles and mighty kings and nobles murder and incest and evil schemes and ghosts and great art if one cares to look for it but in shakespeare's day most didn't any more than most people do now branagh's overacting and his forcing of his interpretation of the story on the viewer may detract from shakespeare's art somewhat but it is better that modern audiences get a piece of it rather than nothing br br i've got to say one more thing though some people are complaining that it's set in the 19th century and that wasn't shakespeare's time well in shakespeare's time their costume and scenery was that of their own day for all of their plays shakespeare may have said it's in the days of ancient rome or medieval denmark or whatever but he didn't dress his characters up like they were he used the costumes of his own time for the same reason his plays are full of anachronisms for example in king john the english and french have cannons in robin hood's day in julius caesar they talk of chimneys which wouldn't be invented for another thousand years and in henry iv they talk about machiavelli who wasn't even born yet then so i think this objection is silly you might as well complain that the play isn't in danish after all they live in denmark don't they
<START> please see also my comment on die nibelungen part 1 siegfried br br the second part of ufa studio's gargantuan production of the nibelungen saga continues in the stylised symphonic and emotionally detached manner of its predecessor however whereas part one was a passionless portrayal of individual acts of heroism part two is a chaotic depiction of bloodletting on a grand scale br br as in part one director fritz lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm with the pace of the action and the complexity of the shot composition rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands these pictures should only be watched with the note perfect gottfried huppertz score which fortunately is on the kino dvd now with this focus on mass action lang is presented with greater challenges in staging the action sequences in his earliest features were often badly constructed but now he simply makes them part of that rhythmic flow with the level of activity on the screen swelling up like an orchestra br br but just as part one made us witness siegfried's adventures matter of factly and without excitement part two presents warfare as devastating tragedy in both pictures there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters that's why lang mostly keeps the camera outside of the action never allowing us to feel as if we are there and this is significant because involving the audience is normally a distinction of lang's work that's also why the performances are unnaturally theatrical with the actors lurching around like constipated sleepwalkers br br nevertheless kriemhild's revenge does constantly deal with emotions and is in fact profoundly humanist the one moment of naturalism is when atilla holds his baby son for the first time and lang actually emphasises the tenderness of this scene by building up to it with the wild frantic ride of the huns the point is that lang never manipulates us into taking sides and in that respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the wagner opera the climactic slaughter is the very antithesis of a rousing battle scene why then did hitler and co get so teary eyed over it a fact which has unfairly tarnished the reputation of these films because the unwavering racial ideology of the nazis made them automatically view the nibelungs as the good guys even if they do kill babies and betray their own kin for hitler their downfall would always be a nationalist tragedy not a human one br br but for us non nazi viewers what makes this picture enjoyable is its beautiful sense of pageantry and musical rhythm when you see these fully developed silent pictures of lang's it makes you realise how much he was wasted in hollywood rather than saddling him with low budget potboilers they should have put him to work on a few of those sword and sandal epics pictures that do not have to be believable and do not have to move us emotionally where it's the poetic operatic tonality that sweeps us along
<START> with the amount of actors they have working on the project they have a wide variety of cast nice starship cgi in places but their green screen needs some work anyone heard of adobe after effects 7 they should buy it get their keying better br br stories are well thought out plenty of trek elements in this to keep it in the right context but but the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode im not homophobic but i cant help that i don't find men kissing entertaining dont mind women anyway for a fan series this is good stuff with minor improvement in their green screen brush up acting and some guidance ratings this series is stunning anyway i recommend this series to who ever enjoyed tng and ds9
<START> if mulder was looking for his real father here he is darren mcgavin the first x files pity it was only one season long the producers of this show didn't know that they had the makings of a classic on their hands and in 1993 along came chris carter with what i call the follow up to the night stalker the x files both will go down as classics is my opinion the two shows taking the viewers to a level of experience that only comes along once in a while and who should appear in the x files years later darren mcgavin as agent arthur dales helping our two favorite hero s solving cases paying homage to the man i think so well done chris carter bringing back a forgotten tv show in the form of david duchovny as darren mcgavin if it wasn't for watching the x files and that particular show i would have never known about the night stalker
