<START> for all the subtle charms this student film may contain was anyone else bored to death waiting wendingo to show his paper macho face br br the anti climax pretty much ruined any sort of momentum we had speed actioned to develop br br don't get me wrong i'm all into exploring america's dark underbelly but this is a turd a flambÃ© that gets a nod to watchable only for the fact that p clarkson looks hot taking it br br sadly from a guy from wings br br the best 2 minutes the film has to offer br br if you felt like ripping off deliverance you could do better
<START> upon the first viewing i found this tale to be at least less annoying than other cannon movie tales after many more i think it's one of the best some of the songs are pretty bad especially the love song but two things stand out that make the movie even the singing worthwhile one is the art direction like the other cannon movie tales this is a beautifully decorated period piece every piece of cloth and jewel both of which have major parts in this movie's plot look fresh and new and contrast with the plain clothes of the peasants even during the love song i find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess wonderfully done the other thing is the comic timing a lot of the movie is cheesy but the emperor's vanity and his making fun of himself in the end the suspicious guard the guard chasing nicholas and the stupid prince were all quite funny and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose and the sequence during the song weave o makes up for the songs that weren't so good
<START> i watched the trailer on the dvd after seeing the film and i think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed it made much of the fact that the film was by the director of cube and made it look like a horror film when in fact it is an absurdist comedy imdb's spell checker doesn't seem to think that absurdist is a word but it is reminiscent of rosencrantz and guildernstern are dead br br i love the way the story builds up slowly at first then gradually escalates i also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film that and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to cube i recommend it
<START> not one of keaton's best efforts this was perhaps a veiled attempt to revenge himself on the family he married into the talmadges a polish english language barrier and a series of coincidences leads buster into a marriage with a large irish woman who along with her father and brothers treat him shabbily until they think he may be an heir to a fortune mistaken identities abound here gags are set up and but for the main fail to pay off br br this metro short does have at least two real laughs buster's cleverly turning around his lack of dinner by using the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally bring the meat to his plate the other is a family photo with the entire group slowly collapsing to the floor as the tripod of the camera loses its stability br br the yeast beer overflow could have been the catalyst for a massive series of gags built upon gags but stops short for all the buildup of development br br kino's print is crisp and clear and the score is one for player piano drums and sound effects not one of buster's best efforts but worth a few laughs
<START> a bit of a disappointing film i'd say the acting was stilted somehow in many cases i just couldn't feel that the facial expressions matched the words spoken or the intent of the scene an angry or sad happy frustrated character should make the viewer believe that he's angry or sad happy frustrated that doesn't happen here br br the comment about the writers assuming you already know the characters was apt they do things and say things which come out of nowhere the character andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other at dinner then he blows up and storms out telling his father don't touch me you f maybe if we'd seen the prequel we would understand where all that comes from but there is no prequel so we're somewhat at sea as to the reason br br one odd quirky thing that andrew does is to go to an old stone quarry sit down on the edge overlooking the still water below then he reaches into his jeans pocket and extracts a pack of cigarettes and lights one up he did this same thing three times during the film i guess we're supposed to see this as some tortured act of being alone and angry maybe once but three times it might even have been four times i lost count br br to be honest there is the fact that he's recently found out that he's adopted this happens very early in the film so there's no sense of any dramatic change he might be undergoing because of this discovery it's not really clear if that's why he's so bitter or if it's about something else br br i guess there is a sort of lynchian feel to the film but should a first time director really be trying to scale such a mountain so early in his career
<START> my all time favorite movie oscar caliber work by everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera the screenplay is perfect and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way unlike the novel the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment it is josie lawrence's best work by far and transformed my opinion of joan plowright having watched this movie at least 50 times i can find no fault in it the music by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel
<START> my 3 year old loved it i loved it my wife loved it so 10 out of 10 from our family as for violence level not really that violent mostly of the slap stick variety nobody truly dies no gore no blood no torture so it certainly is appropriate for children much more so than many saturday morning cartoons br br this movie really takes the idea of cg movies where it should go br br first of all beautiful graphics textures wonderfully done with true depth not trying to be realistic but forming an artistic whole the moss on the stones the rust on metal the reliefs on the wood and the stone everything adds to the whole br br character modeling unlike many contemporary cg movies is quirky not cute again within an artistic whole the faces may look less malleable than in some other movies but the characters are more puppet like than human like i think that is a good thing it lends veracity how strangely it may sound it is easier to suspend your disbelief br br hair fur clothing on par at least with the likes of pixar just note in the opening scenes when lian chu is fighting the giant slug gwizdo is in front of some farmers and all of them have detailed clothing which caused me to pause the movie just to admire it br br the setting far beyond the likes of cars and even wallÂe space has been done many times but the fantasy environs of dragon hunters are only comparable with some scenes in never ending story and lord of the rings but again it is an artistic whole and with lots of good ideas thrown about effortlessly magnificent vistas like the scene in monsters inc where they ride all the doorways through its storage facility or wallÂe where we see the immense trash towers he made abound in this movie everything is grand yet never dwelt upon it is just the background the whole way the interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic falls the chinese wall the islands floating in the sky the broccoli in the sky that is truly where i believe cg should go make something which takes your breath away and do it again and again br br the sound is good the music is varied and not only epic and thankfully without any vocals and purely original for the movie br br animation is quite good lending its inspiration to cartoons especially some good use of stretch and squeeze sometimes not that realistic but the 3d models are not realistic either br br characterization is well done too lian chu the gentle and uncertain giant is gradually growing in confidence basking in the attention of little zoÃ© br br gwizdo the wily manager of lian chu redeems himself in the end while zoÃ© isn't really changed at all but who wants that cute child to change anyway i at least loved lian chu more than any other recent character since sulley in monsters inc br br the internal strife in the group gets ironed out by the external pressures just as it should in a proper fantasy story br br the story is mostly reminiscent of the never ending story especially how the world brakes apart the monsters are pretty standard fare except the flocking one it lacks the emotional impact of wallÂe which is the really strong point of that movie but it is a much more fun ride and lacks the annoying musical scene replaying in the former one and has action from the first scene this movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time br br the whole movie has as i've mentioned a whole vision which seems to have been followed rigorously throughout br br it seems that the setting is ready for more adventures and i for one would hope so br br one side note the french actor doing lian chu sounded a bit like jean reno at first but i'm happy it wasn't him though he is one of my favorites nice to hear a new to me voice br br i give it a max rating a bit surprised at the mediocre and low ratings by some i have tried to address some of the concerns made by two of the reviews with the lowest vote approach this movie as an adventure and as a european movie not opposed to hollywood but different
<START> atlantis was much better than i had anticipated in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age although this film did demand a soid attention span at times it was a great film for all ages i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis
<START> i just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced 45 mins of roll br br roll is about a country boy mat toby malone who has dreams of becoming a sports star mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin george damien robertson well that was the plan anyway george is involved with a gangster tiny john batchelor and is making a delivery for him needless to say mat gets dragged into george's world br br i thought it was great how mat teaches george some morals and respect while george teaches mat how to relax and enjoy life a little toby and damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job br br every character in the movie complimented each other very well the two cops were great david ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters 'pando' from two hands br br one of the other things that i liked about roll was that it showcased the cities that i grew up and lived in for 20 years perth and fremantle it was good to see sights and landmarks that i grew up with especially the old ferris wheel br br this rocks 'n' rolls
<START> ask yourself where she got the gun remember what she was taught about the mark's mindset when the con is over the gun had blanks and it was provided to her from the very beginning br br when the patient comes back at the end she was supposed to see him drive away in the red convertible and lead her to the gang splitting up her 80 thousand br br the patient was in on the con from the beginning br br mantegna does not die in the end the gun had blanks br br there enough spoilers for you there this is why people are giving it such high ratings it's extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons most of the audience
<START> i have seen this movie this movie is the best according today's need dowry in marriages is the major problem nowadays in stating this problem this movie is the best in this movie the indian values are stated very well today's youth must understand this problem there is less population of girls and due to this problem of dowry the girls committed suicide if this problem continues then the day when there is no girl child is not far away so keep in mind this statement today's youth must understand that we can not take dowry in marriages we have to learn from this movie that the dowry should not be taken and if we understand this problem then we can see the new trend in the society this is the major change in the society
<START> massive multiple chills down the spine i'm surprised there's people who didn't like it i saw it at 10 o'clock in the morning and still got scared stiff and i've seen hundreds of thrillers horror movies for crying out loud i'm 22 i mean ok voice acting not particularly good probably even b movie ish but the genuine look of terror the sound effects the flow from the very start hitting you again and again with relentless unforgiving terrorising scenes so many clichÃ©s yet none fails to surprise scare you know it's coming it's coming it's coming boo and you still jump off the chair grab a pillow and a blanket call your closest friend over and do not watch it at night hats off to the japanese
<START> what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film i saw this at the atlanta georgia dragoncon considering that this is my main town i am very much a sci fi aficionado and enjoy action type films i happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when i noticed this film playing in the morning this is not a sci fi nor action film of any sort let me just start out by saying that i am not a fan of witchblade nor of eric etebari having watched a few episodes his performance in that seemed stale and robotic but he managed to really win me over in this performance i mean really win me over having seen cellular i did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy but his performance as kasadya was simply amazing he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon but there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me i later looked it up online and found that eric won the best actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect now i keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that i did not pay attention to them sorry brian they were very nicely done but i was even more impressed with the story which i think was even more his goal seeing films like godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off i could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head the situation of an abusive family is never an easy one i showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse this is one film that i think about constantly and would highly recommend
<START> i admit the problem i have with the much celebrated ealing films i've seen so far could be mine to my taste either they are black and rippingly funny or so light in tone to be unsatisfying as comedies or stories that's a self important way of saying i wanted to like the man in the white suit but found myself struggling to sit through its short run time br br textile worker sidney stratton alec guinness may be meek in manner but he is doggedly committed to progress in the form of his attempts to invent a strand of fabric that can't be broken or made dirty using a factory lab for his latest experiment he toils against limitations both material and human the latter being the benighted mill bosses who don't understand what he is up to then figure it out and become even more committed to stopping him br br it's small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress sidney complains practicing in the mirror what he struggles to say to the man br br one problem with man in the white suit is that sidney's vision of progress is awfully small minded too more so even than that of the bosses or the laborers who also resent his work my problem is more elemental for a comedy white suit is not funny it's a rather earnest script which too often tries to mine its feeble attempts at humor from spit takes double takes triple takes and dizzy takes br br the best joke is the sound of the machine sidney toils at going bleep blop bleep bop endlessly and fetching queer looks from every visitor until sidney either extracts his miracle from it or blows it up trying like every other bit of stray humor that functions decently in this film it's leaned on too long br br i've never seen guinness less affecting in a movie even though he looks impossibly young and earnest though actually in his mid 30s he seems so bloodless even more so than the wax faced general he played in doctor zhivago he's the same cold fish whether he's ignoring the sad affections of the affecting mill girl who offers to give him her life savings when he loses his job pan faced vida hope as bertha or the more sultry charms of young daphne birnley joan greenwood his one real ally in his fight against shabbiness and dirt as she puts it making those words sound as impossibly sexy as only greenwood could br br supporting players make white suit work as well as it does ernest thesinger of bride of frankenstein fame plays a singularly nasty captain of industry who looks like nosferatu and makes a laugh like a death rattle howard marion crawford as another factory leader is as memorable here as he was playing a blinkered medical officer in lawrence of arabia then there's the undeniable charm of mandy miller as a little girl who steals her few moments on camera right from under everyone else br br but most of the scenes are played so straight that one wouldn't think director alexander mackendrick had ever worked on a comedy before his previous ealing comedy whisky galore doesn't reverse that impression alas roger macdougall's play posits the notion of scientific progress as potential disaster but fails to present dull sidney in anything other than the most blandly pleasant of lights br br ealing comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy yet the ealings i've seen never seem to do this working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathies kind hearts and coronets and the ladykillers mackendrick again go figure are classics this way white suit on the other hand is a pointless ramble that falls apart when it should cohere just like that unfortunate suit
<START> harold pinter rewrites anthony schaeffer's classic play about a man going to visit the husband of his lover and having it all go sideways the original film starred laurence olivier and michael caine caine has the olivier role in this version and he's paired with jude law here the film is directed by kenneth branaugh br br the acting is spectacular both caine and law are gangbusters in their respective roles i really like the chemistry and the clashing of personalities it's wonderful and enough of a reason to watch when the script's direction goes haywire br br harold pinter's dialog is crisp and sharp and often very witty and i understand why he was chosen to rewrite the play which is updated to make use of surveillance cameras and the like the problem is that how the script moves the characters around is awful michale caine walks law through his odd modern house with sliding doors and panels for no really good reason conversations happen repeatedly in different locations i know pinter has done that in his plays but in this case it becomes tedious why do we need to have the pair go over and over and over the fact that law is sleeping with caine's wife it would be okay if at some point law said enough we've done this but he doesn't he acts as if each time is the first time the script also doesn't move caine through his manipulation of law all that well to begin with he's blindly angry to start so he has no chance to turn around and scare us never mind a late in the game revelation that makes you wonder why he bothered in the original we never suspected what was up here we do and while it gives an edge it also somehow feels false since its so clear we are forced to wonder why law's milo doesn't see he's being set up there are a few other instances but to say more would give away too much br br thinking about the film in retrospect i think its a film of missed opportunities and missteps the opportunities squandered are the chance to have better fireworks between caine and law missteps in that the choice of a garish setting and odd shifts in plot take away from the creation of a tension and a believable thriller instead we get some smart dialog and great performances in a film that doesn't let them be real br br despite some great performances and witty dialog this is only a 4 out of 10 because the rest of the script just doesn't work
<START> before lost everything shown on tv was predictable you could predict who was gonna die or who will find something but in lost you could predict nothing every thing was so surprisingly stunning and it really was a mystery not because it has so many secrets but because there was nothing like it before everything was so great i literally became addicted to it lost is a classic work of art it gives you something to look forward to every week it is genius the surrounding is brilliant it is calm and warm at the beach and so scary in the jungle the characters are a work of genius every one of them especially the ones already on the island the castaways are so dramatic yet we can never predict their deaths because they have so much more to do and so much more to say and they have secrets affecting the other castaways that die with them
<START> return of the boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn't play like a movie it plays like an episode of a tv sitcom when they flashback to older episodes return of the boogyman is just a clip show br br mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie over and over again the same footage how boring this is br br the movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie br br i have seen the first movie i don't want to see the same scenes over and over again and i don't know who would the whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it
<START> mature intelligent and highly charged melodrama unbelivebly filmed in china in 1948 wei wei's stunning performance as the catylast in a love triangle is simply stunning if you have the oppurunity to see this magnificent film take it
<START> a not bad but also not so great heist film kirk douglas is a recently released from prison safe cracker who after turning down an offer from the mob decides to pull the job himself he recruits circus gymnast giuliano gemma mayhem ensues douglas and gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon romano puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend florinda bolkan director michele lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving puppo gemma though an italian production most of the filming appears to have been done in germany douglas is fine not just slumming it in an giallo quickie the striking bolkan gives a terrific performance the music is by ennio morricone and the cinematography is by the great tonino delli colli who managed to work with everyone in italy from wertmuller and fellini to pasolini and leone
<START> don't get me wrong this is a terrible clichÃ©d film but it is a delight for fans of olivia hussey quite possibly the most intoxicating beauty ever to grace the silver screen one poster stated that she was unpleasant to look at i wonder what his ideal woman looks like paris hil slut blockbuster should really establish a sub genre to this type of film as the fatal attraction plot has become a genre unto itself when will blockbuster adopt the adultry section it will fit in quite nicely between the drama and action sections right this film revolves around olivia hussey who spends a night of passion with an unstable yacht owner who may have murdered his ex wife who looks remarkably like ms hussey this ne'er do well proceeds to stalk olivia and thus make her life a living hell i like olivia hussey but i have no sympathy for characters in movies that cheat on their spouses so i really wasn't rooting for olivia to make it out o this stinker alive br br violence there is a smattering of violence in the film don murray and anthony john denison get involved in a fisticuffs when denison says that he will not stop seeing olivia murray's wife because she is just too good in bed olivia also gets to handle a shooter and might get to squeeze off a round i'll let you watch br br nudity olivia is the queen of brief nudity and supplies a little here she has a love scene with anthony john denison and also has a shower scene shot at a distance br br story we've seen this plot before a hundred times over and oftentimes done much better the true culprit when trying to decipher why this film was a dud is william riead the man's dialogue is sophomoric and moronic the man has no story telling abilities and fails to build believable human reactions to the plot these people of the upper strata of society talk like middle school kids with a habit of sleeping during english class i have placed riead on the never to be viewed again list br br acting the acting wasn't phoned in as the insiders say but was hindered a great deal by riead's juvenile script olivia hussey resorts to calling anthony jonh denison weird and crazy to his face when he begins to stalk her hussey who is still beautiful delivers the best performance here but denison was equal to the task of portraying a demented love crazed stalker don murray was basically just there his character not fleshed out and edward asner a terrific actor when given something with substance is ill used in this film
