<START> although most americans have little knowledge of his work other than star wars alec guinness produced an amazing body of work particularly in the 1940s 1950s ranging from dramas to quirky comedies i particularly love his comedies as they are so well done and seem so natural and real on the screen far different from the usual fare from hollywood br br this being said this was the film that sparked my interest in these movies it's plot was so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhere except for ealing studios which had a particular fondness for little films like this one br br guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company he wants to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible though he is not working for the company as a researcher but for janitorial work so he tends to sneak into labs either during the day if no one suspects or at night and try his hand at inventing repeatedly he is caught such as after he blew up the lab and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds then despite the importance of the discovery he sets off a completely unanticipated chain of events and then the fun begins br br the film is a wonderful satire that pokes fun at industry unions the government and people in general
<START> this rather poorly named western series won an emmy for best syndicated program and is certainly an interesting series it was produced by republic the studio which did action better than anyone and they put their best into it each episode was built around a real historical figure of the old west a railroad detective named matt clark similar to the later elliot ness with the gangsters of the 1920's and 30's managed to become involved with almost every notorious western outlaw between the middle of the 1800's and wwi the series' best asset was jim davis tall rugged ruggedly good looking in prime shape with an authentic western accent and great riding skills which made him utterly convincing in the action scenes davis was every inch the western hero he was teamed with two lovely and active co stars mary castle as frankie during the first season and kristine miller as jonesy during the second each worked well with davis br br what separated this show from its contemporaries and much of what came later was the professionalism invested in the action scenes ace action directer william witney directed 30 episodes franklin adreon the rest both filmed the action with polish republic's vast store of stock footage from serials and b's was utilized to give scope the level of individual episodes rose or fell with the quality of the guest stars brought in to the play the outlaws among the really good ones were marie windsor as belle starr lee van cleef as jesse james fess parker as grat dalton jean parker as cattle kate and joe sawyer and slim pickins as butch cassady and the smilin' kid the cream of the western up and comers pickins parker denver pyle james best and richard jaeckel honed their craft b veterans with decades of experience under their belts harry woods glenn strange kenneth macdonald earle hodgkins steve darrell and chief yowlachie provided the old leather feel of vintage westerns br br the weakness of the concept was that there are only so many famous western outlaws by the second season the famous figures were becoming a mite obscure for all by the most dedicated history buff nevertheless a few of the later shows were a match for any due to the guest stars henry brandon portrayed rustler nate champion and former republic star don barry was outstanding as small time outlaw milt sharp br br western fans or history buffs will want to see this
<START> i won't repeat all that has been said already by other viewers of this film br br in my opinion this is an excellent film not only as a very human tale of the developing relationship between a father and his grown up son but also as a little window onto the world of practising islam for those like me who are not very familiar with that religion br br an important aspect of this story is that of the young man's relation to his father's beliefs and practices and how his attitude towards the religion seems to alter in subtle ways as we progress on their journey with them br br this is a very thought provoking enjoyable and well made film that i would recommend to anyone with brain and heart
<START> where to even start the horrendous acting the nonsensical plot the bargain basement effects the completely loathsome characters the choppy editing the headache inducing casio keyboard score the embarrassingly racist remarks watch it charlie back off jackie chan the constant misogyny i am a lifelong horror fan and i have no problem at all with the current torture thon trend of movies however this is a poorly made piece of garbage i think i suffered more pain watching this than the characters did dying in it if you like girls being forced to eat stir fried penis really poor soft core porn and think lines like i'm gonna find that b and staple her c shut are clever live feed is for you br br as for me i feel the need to go wash my eyes out with oven cleaner to prevent from ever seeing this movie again
<START> before i comment on this movie i just watched on youtube i have to admit that the reason i checked this out was to rewatch something i first saw on the tv ads in 1980 barbara bach's cleavage and since the movie received an r rating i expected to see her nude alas no dice for her or of the other gorgeous actress that appeared here stacey nelkin who's supposed to be a teen but was actually 20 when she made this seeing her in a bra and panty and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as arousing as ms bach they provide some of the scattered laughs this movie provides in fact i don't blame ron leibman for having his name removed from the credits since his role as the tight fisted liceman is pretty embarrassing though i did like the seduction scene he did with ms nelkin this also happens to be the debut of ralph macchio who's the loner among the misfits sent to an academy school the others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and ms bach an arab who worships motor oil and a politician's son who loves his girlfriend candy nelkin's character so much he risks sneaking in the middle of the night see her in the girls academy among the supporting cast tom poston plays a swishy character named sisson who i found partly amusing with a screenplay by tom patchett and jay tarses and direction by robert downey sr whose son robert downey jr has a cameo early on in a soccer scene up the academy is uneven with the politically incorrect humor but unless you're really offended at the scatological and sexual content this is actually a pretty harmless comedy that mad magazine and its trademark cover boy alfred e newman shouldn't be ashamed of even though they once had their name and character taken off the picture p s another one of the misfits was harry teinowitz who was born in my birth town of chicago ill he played rodney ververgaert he also says one of my favorite lines i'm trying to come
<START> i bought this dvd for Â£1 and now i realise why the acting was the worst i've seen in a long time the lighting and sound are shoddy at best the plot makes little sense even when sober warning i don't advise watching this film when sober this film feels like you're watching the home movie of someone who doesn't get out much it really is a shame that all the very little money spent on this project went to such a waste i look forward to seeing if any of those envoled still have a career other than eva longoria who is the only star of this film that was apparently not hit with the bad acting stick i'm sorry that none of this criticism seems constructive but i will say one thing to james cahill don't try it again in the words of squirlyem its severely lacking in the good department
<START> this is my kind of film i am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that but it is also a dark comedy while i see it mostly as a horror thriller there will be others who might see it as a black dramatic comedy br br but either way it is a fascinating descent into madness the ending caught me off guard but what an ending it leaves the viewer a lot to think about br br powerful performances a complex and detailed plot a great script filled with dread and dashes of humor and an eerie atmosphere make this a film worth watching br br personally i think that i will need to watch this several more times to pick up and understand all the subtleties that are within but it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a chore so to do
<START> not an altogether bad start for the program but what a slap in the face to real law enforcement the worst part of the series is that it attempts to bill itself as reality fare and is anything but men and women that dedicate their lives to the enforcement of laws deserve better than this what is next medical school in a minute charo performing lipo charles grodin assisting on a hip replacement c'mon show a little respect even the citizens of muncie are outing the program as staged police academy high school gym poor editing how many times can they use the car to car shot of the taco bell in the background cheesy siren effects the same loop added ad nauseum to every 'call' whether rolling code or not and last but not least more officer safety issues than you could shake a stick at br br if i want to see manufactured police work and wise ass fake cops i would watch reno 911
<START> what was this about pre destination you can not change the future cause it has already been written br br i'll give it this much i did want to see what happened next and therefore watched the whole movie this movie took a concept and made it watchable br br if you're looking for a recommendation see it at matinee prices no thrills but an interesting concept they should have left the y2k reference out
<START> i don't remember a movie where i have cared less about where the characters have come from what happens to them or where they are going i realize that hollywood's greatest pastime is navel gazing but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with for what it's worth though the discussion that followed the showing under the auspices of the key sunday cinema series did make allowance that possibly the three women did show some redeeming characteristics i disagree
<START> i've just visited russian forum of our tv channel that had showed this film well 99 per cent of active russian audience is disappointed we wanted to see more true facts of our space achievements in this film but authors had in mind something else we are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here we are proud of all our space dreams real achievements on the one hand in this field and in science on the other hand so i'd like to ask authors where is our lunohod and where the hell our mir station ah i'm quite sure that lunohod events took place much earlier armstrong's walk on moon and to comment numerous technical and science mistakes i really have no time and enough space here se our constructive critics in russian forum on www 1tv ru
<START> 'they all laughed' is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that it's set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben gazzara and the late john ritter who is superb and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novak the films co producer and john ritter basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnate's wife hepburn and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production 'they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans
<START> this movie scared me so bad i am easily scared though so its no big thing but this movie was scary and whoever wasnt scared by this movie im surprised because everyone i know said it was scary i hope everyone sees it but dont see it with the lights off like i did
<START> i married a japanese woman 14 years ago we're still together br br however in the 1950's it would never have been as easy br br life in the military had been mined for action drama and comedy for years by this point mined to death the mixed relationships gave it new ground to cover this is old hat today but then marrying an asian back then meant you either owed somebody something or you were a freak of some sort this touched on both possibilities along with the third maybe it is love br br brando did his usual good job garner did a better job than he usually does he's good but this showed how good he could be umecki chan had a helluva debut here and while i think she earned her statue she didn't really stretch it was a role that no one who hadn't been overseas would have recognized and the newness was the corker br br the real scene stealer was red buttons red was the best thing in this film bank on it and the japanese lifestyles were shown in an admirable light as well br br a classic
<START> nifty little episode played mainly for laughs but with clever dollop of suspense somehow a martian has snuck aboard a broken down bus on its way to nowhere but which passenger is it talk about your illegal immigrants all star supporting cast from wild eyed jack elam hamming it up shamelessly to sexy jean willes if she's the martian then i say let's open the borders to cruel faced john hoyt the most obvious suspect along with familiar faces john archer and barney phillips and a nice turn from bill kendis as the bus driver makes for a very entertaining half hour even if the action is confined to a single set
<START> i am glad to read so many negative comments about the tritter plot everyone i talk to says the same thing they like house's gruff nature and his intelligence but really dislike the vindictiveness of this continuing plot it cuts into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority it needs to have a more caring nature instead of the vindictiveness to everyone at the hospital also there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what tritter is actually doing he alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for patients a lot of the vindictiveness he is showing also is hurting the very sick patients at the hospital and the is not a good storyline to portray i voted the episode awful not because of the story itself but when you insert the trittor piece it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it people say they hate to watch the story lines anymore please change it get tritter out
<START> in director sooraj barjatya's vivah 20 something delhi boy shahid kapur finds himself smitten by the demure small town girl his father has selected for him to marry drawn to her innocence and simplicity shahid agrees to the marriage barely moments after he's met her at her home in madhupur and the young lady in question amrita rao seems equally floored by her charming suitor the marriage is fixed for six months later and the couple find themselves in the first throes of young budding love their geographical distance notwithstanding but amrita who's been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents' death is struck by a horrible calamity just hours before the marriage and then it's up to shahid to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionally much in the same vein as hum aapke hain koun and hum saath saath hain barjatya's new film vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise but sadly the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated even more far fetched than those regressive ekta kapoor soaps and the problem is clear Â you just can't relate to such squeaky clean characters who don't have one bad bone in their bodies there are many things that work in favour of and against hindi films and timing is one such important factor twenty five years ago perhaps the plot of vivah may not have felt like such a stretch but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp perhaps the film's only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish you can make out right away that the filmmaker's intention is not to deceive judging both by barjatya's previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that barjatya believes in a perfect world he believes in his good as gold characters he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumps but alas he's unable to translate his vision to the screen it's difficult to overlook how one dimensional his protagonists are Â shahid and amrita both virtuous and virginal Â i mean think about it the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film barjatya may think he's returning to his maine pyar kiya roots with vivah but truth is that the reason we embraced salman and bhagyashree in that film or even salman and madhuri in hum aapke hain koun is because they had such fantastic chemistry because although they were created out of the same mould as shahid and amrita in vivah those pairs had mischief and masti shahid and amrita are just insipid and boring for a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story the filmmaker chooses a string of 70s style tunes that only further slacken the film's deadening pace but if i had to choose just one reason to explain why vivah doesn't work for me it's because i'm not sure i can relate to any of the characters who inhabit barjatya's story to some perhaps vivah will give hope that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere but i'm a little cynical i guess so give me the coquettish madhuri of hum aapke hain kaun give me the bratty salman of maine pyar kiya i'll even take that mischievous karisma kapoor of hum saath saath hain but save me from these dullards you know some marriages aren't made in heaven this one's vivah
<START> okay so i'm not a big video game buff but was the game house of the dead really famous enough to make a movie from sure they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie as though justifying any particular scene of violence but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same with the hand in the bottom on the screen supposedly your own holding whatever weapon and goo ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be br br it's an interesting premise in house of the dead with a lot of college kids loaded college kids as it were kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like 1 500 just for a ride after they miss their boat trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year the first thing that comes to mind about house of the dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations at least in this case the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed they look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter tops but at least they thought they were dressed for the occasion br br clint howard tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far delivers an absolutely awful performance the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie i can't stand it when well known actors change their accents in movies it is so rarely effective and howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well known actor pretend that he's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air he didn't even rasp well it sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something real tough there clint i expected more from him but then again he did agree to a part in this mess br br once we get to the island the movie temporarily turns into any one of the friday the 13th movies that took place at camp crystal lake lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed the nudity was impressive i guess but let's consider something for a minute these kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the rave of the year find no one and say well who wants a beer even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight here you have the input from director uwe boll there's alcohol they won't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves br br so not only do they start drinking not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they're alone it's like they expected to find the island empty and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while they would have some privacy since there's no one else around brilliant br br now for the things that everyone hated judging by the reviews that i've read about the movie yes intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie mostly in order to show that yes the movie was being faithful to directly copying the video game sure it was a stupid idea i can't imagine who thought up that little nugget but worse than that is the matrix style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over after the first time at which point i found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film br br one of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans who are much faster but getting tired running out of places to run and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with the first two are done right in the movie the kids are terrified and don't have a lot of places to run since they're on an island but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler they find themselves heavily armed and i mean that very strongly i mean these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead br br then you have what i call the techno slasher scene since the rave never happened and i guess since uwe boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video there's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it's nothing but a blur of gory shot mostly only about 5 frames long which is about 1 6 of a second flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music clever i guess but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross out effect because you can't see any one thing for long enough to react to it you're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie br br i've seen a lot of people compare this movie to resident evil mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it and they're exactly right i appreciate that at least here as was not the case in resident evil it wasn't some man made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires 28 days later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie it's just too bad that house of the dead didn't do a single original thing except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based just in case you forget i really think that this should have been a much better movie while obviously i can't say that i know much about the game it's based on just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie but unfortunately i think that's more often the case than not with horror movies it's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no holds barred horror film and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot which suggests the possibility of a sequel
<START> i have not seen many low budget films i must admit but this is the worst movie ever probably the main character the old man talked like he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds a 5 year old could act better the story had the most awful plot and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was and hoped it was leading onto the real movie i cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight i think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman i think the only thing ok with the budget was the make up but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit awful simply awful
<START> some fraud girl tries to compete in the big leagues of motorcross by swiching places with her brother she gets to the top by lying and manipulation she should have been disqualified the movie promotes lying and cheating to win also the idea of a 9 yr old mechanic is absurd it takes many many years to get good go back to the tonka toys
