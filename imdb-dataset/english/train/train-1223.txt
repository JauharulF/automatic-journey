<START> there are two points i need to make clear right at the beginning first of all we all know what this year's oscar's were really all about this year it was the academy's way of showing people that they are no racist and never have been they wanted to clear all preconceived notions about themselves secondly it's kinda pointless to make remarks about the show because really what difference will it make but it's fun to write about it this is the year i became fed up with the oscar's i will never watch the show again every year they do something wrong before crowe wins for gladaitor when they real winner should of been ralph fiennes for sunshine if you haven't seen this movie yet watch it and you'll agree eyes wide shut when released receieved no nominations and as far as this year goes well the bad choices were all over the place baz lurhmann gets no best director nomination are you joking a beautiful mind is up for best make up training day gets nominated the movie was awful and it seemed like washington didn't even turn in a performance all he proved was he knows how to use four letter words that's what h won the award for take away the language and i bet he was almost playing himself i liked gosford park i really did but why 7 nominations and how on earth could they not give it too altman i mean c'mon if there just giving the award to people to clear up any bad feelings what about altman the man has been in the public's eye for 32 years now and no oscar there were many many things that bothered me about this year's oscar's but i'll live with it as long as i never have to watch another show again the highpoint and the only one of the show was when woody allen made his first appearance ever to the award show that will go down as one of the greatest moments in he history of the show
<START> alright i have to admit that i have never seen rhoda and only one or two episodes of the mary tyler moore show even though i don't know anything about this duo of comedic talent i still liked this movie a lot br br mary goes back to work rose tries her luck at being a comedian rhoda struggles with a photography career and meredith what exactly does she do again these three stories that we follow over two hours are amusing and entertaining in their own way when the two long time friends reunite it only makes the film better br br i was surprised about how good the writing was the little jokes thrown in by mary and rhoda were funny the script itself was very well put together br br i had seen moore and harper in other movies over the past few years and thought that they were very good but i had no idea that they worked this well as a team while both actresses do their share to fulfill the title of this movie they never seem to let me down during the run of this movie joie lenz and marisa ryan play their roles okay but nothing great the rest of the cast like jonah cecile and everybody else also works well together br br being that this is a reunion you would expect for a fan of either show to enjoy this from a non fan i still enjoyed this little get together good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good the newer version of the mtm theme song doesn't hurt either
<START> a guy thing may not be a classic but it sure is a good funny comedy the plot focuses on paul jason lee who wakes up the morning after his bachelor party with no memory and becky julia stiles lying naked in his bed before he can figure out what happened he rushes becky out of his apartment because his fiance karen selma blair is coming after that as you could imagine chaos ensues br br almost every single scene in a guy thing delivers loud laughs the funniest moments come from when paul imagines what could happen if he tells karen selma blair is a truly talented comedian and the worst thing about this film is that she goes underused although she turns out to be more funny than stiles' character who actually isn't that interesting of course not every comedy is perfect br br as i said a guy thing is no classic but it's not bad either 7 10
<START> okay if you have a couple hours to waste or if you just really hate your life i would say watch this movie if anything it's good for a few laughs not only do you have obese topless natives but also special effects so bad they are probably outlawed in most states seriuosly the rating of 'pg' is pretty humorous too once you see the native porn extravaganza i wouldn't give this movie to my retarded nephew you couldn't even show this to iraqi prisoners without violating the geneva convention the plot is sketchy and clichÃ© and dumb and stupid the acting is horrible and the ending is so painful to watch i actually began pouring salt into my eye just to take my mind off of the idiocy filling my tv screen
<START> i have to start by telling you how i came across this movie it was winter time in alaska around the year 1990 a friend of mine from australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment winters in alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television i had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was a treasure it is quite possibly the best worst movie ever we spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish we watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effect it is a true gem the laughs will come nonstop and the memories last forever if you see this movie for rent in a video store steal it you won't regret it
<START> kurt russell is elvis plain and simple his dedication to this role resulted in what i think is the best movie bio ever if you're an elvis fan see it if you can br br the made for television film was made two years after elvis' death br br one piece of advice there are two versions one at 180 minutes and one at 117 minutes the only one to watch is the longer one the shorter one has more than one hour of footage edited out it just does not work because the scenes in it are often dependent on the scenes that were cut br br this masterpiece takes you from elvis childhood through his emergence as entertainment's greatest star shelley winters and bing russell kurt's real dad are excellent as elvis' parents and pat hingle delivers a very competent col tom parker br br long live the king
<START> with all of the violence on tv and in the local news it is refreshing to have a show that has no violence or adult language yet is still entertaining my children look forward to watching with us every week each of us have a favorite chef and favorite judges we all enjoy elton brown we enjoy learning about the background of the main ingredient unique vegetables and seasonings we play along at home to guess who the winner will be br br it is a great hour of entertainment as well as informational best of all in our hussle bussle life it is an hour the family spends together
<START> house of evil aka dance of death of 1968 is the first of four infamous and odd last movies starring the great boris karloff and directed by jack hill and juan ibÃ¡nez unlike snake people 1971 the incredible invasion also 1971 and the fear chamber 1972 which were all released after karloff's death in 1969 house of evil was released in 1968 when karloff was still alive house of evil is regarded by many as the worst of these four movies which are without doubt all rather crappy but definitely have their entertainment value as the unintentional comedies they are i personally prefer the fear chamber and house of evil over the other two simply for the reason that the lack of the slightest logic is even more extreme and since there is no suspense whatsoever in any of the movies the lack of logic increases the unintentional fun factor br br the odd story i don't know if i can really call it a 'plot' is set somewhere in europe in the 19th century after some girls are murdered and found with their eyes ripped out mathias morteval karloff an enthusiastic organ player invites his few remaining relatives to his bizarre mansion which is full of eerie toys his kinfolk includes lucy durant julissa who is engaged to one of the police inspectors investigating the murders br br i won't give away more of the story but i can assure you that it is quite bizarre throughout the movie there are some very funny moments especially some things karloff's character says boris karloff was without any doubt one of the most brilliant and important icons of the horror genre who ever lived and he manages to award this odd movie with a tiny bit of his greatness and although or because his role is due to a poor script and and directing in no way scary it looks like he deliberately plays it with a sense of humor just like in the movie's successors snake people and the fear chamber the female lead is once again played by julissa br br most of he supporting performances are hilariously amateurish the cinematography is terrible and the locations and sceneries are beneath contempt the storyline lacks the least bit of logic and the dialogue often does not make the slightest sense it is the poor story and dialogue however that makes this movie so entertaining to watch house of evil may be an extremely crappy attempt of a movie but it is certainly as unintentionally funny as it is bad fans of ed wood's movies should be very amused i personally found it hilarious crappy but entertaining nevertheless and definitely worth watching since there's boris karloff in it and due to the fun factor 3 10
<START> after i watched this movie i came to imdb and read some of the reviews which compared it to lost in translation lite when i read that i immediately could see the reviewers point br br this movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme interestingly the format of the movie is nearly identical but the pacing is incredibly different 10 items rushes the viewer through the 1 day time line of the movie whereas the better planned lost in seems to stretch out over a few long days br br i'm sure some people will see this because it has morgan freeman and will be disappointed it seems his better roles now a days are supporting roles in big blockbusters rather than leading roles in sub 10mil limited release movies and indie films
<START> here is proof of why mary pickford was america's sweetheart ' in this rather complex drama mary plays the young daughter of a squatter that dare to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the hill toppers ' the scenes where they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply delightful she is even willing to take a bath that mary could pull this role off at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat due to her diminutive stature 5' br br tess must face numerous physical and emotional challenges she does so with spunk not seen in many heroines of the time tess packs a wallop and is not shy about fighting with anyone why she agrees to help the hill topper' daughter is beyond me but she sacrifices her own happiness in order to keep a deep secret pickford's close ups are wonderful br br danish born jean hersholt is simply wonderful as the villain the scene in which he manhandles a small baby is enough to make you throw vegetables or whatever at the movie screen if forrest robinson who plays daddy skinner had worn a beard he would have been a match for the model used in those world war i recruiting posters of uncle sam Â wants you br br although the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning it is worth the investment in your time to see the piece or pure americana ' the film highlights choices available to us all involving making someone else happy and what it is to be a real christian recommended
<START> memoirs of a geisha is a visually stunning melodrama that seems more like a camp drag queen satire than anything to do with real people br br the first half of the film defensively keeps insisting that geishas are neither prostitutes nor concubines that they are the embodiment of traditional japanese beauty but other than one breathtaking dance the rest of the movie degenerates into pretty baby in storyville territory or at least vashti and esther in the purim story as all the women's efforts at art and artifice are about entertaining much much older drunken boorish men maybe it is japanese culture that is being prostituted and not just to the american louts after world war ii br br perhaps it's the strain of speaking in english but ziyi zhang shows barely little of the great flare she demonstrated in house of flying daggers shi mian mai fu and hero ying xiong michelle yeoh occasionally gets to project a glimmer of her assured performance in crouching tiger hidden dragon wo hu cang long only li gong shows any real life otherwise i kept picturing charles ludlam in various roles or even cillian murphy as in kabuki theater particularly as the plot dragged down in cat fight after cat fight br br the supposed love story has zero chemistry mostly due to the age differences and i mostly felt sorry for ken watanabe and hoped his hollywood pay check compensated for his loss of dignity as the mysterious chairman i remember more emotion in portrait of jennie as the young girl is anxious to grow up into jennifer jones to please joseph cotton br br we see brief glimpses of reality when the geishas pose with regular women as photographic attractions and as an ageless ziyi zhang lives out the war years in a very colorful kimono dying operation the finale has little sense of normality br br the score includes many chopped up traditional melodies with cello by yo yo ma and violin by yitzhack pearlman instead of traditional instrumentation that are beautiful to listen to in accompaniment to the lovely cinematography as long as one completely ignores the plot and stiff acting br br as my mind wandered i wondered how the great japanese directors of samurai movies would have dealt with this story which probably would have been more formal but a lot more emotional
<START> br br what is left of planet earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag tag survivors they must eat bugs and insects or whatever after a poison war or something has nearly wiped out all human civilization in these dark times one of the few people on earth still able to live in comfort we will call him the all knowing big boss has a great quest to prevent some secret spore seeds from being released into the air it seems that the all knowing big boss is the last person on earth that knows that these spores even exist the spores are located far away from any living soul and they are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems br br the all knowing big boss wants the secret spores to remain in their secret protected containers so he makes a plan to send in a macho action team to remove the spore containers from all of the protective systems and secret location sending people to the location of secret spores makes them no longer a secret sending people to disable all of the protective systems makes it possible for the spores to be easily released into the air how about letting sleeping dogs lie br br the one pleasant feature of encrypt is the radiant and elegant vivian wu as the unremarkable macho action team members drop off with mechanically paced predictable timing engaging vivian wu's charm makes acceptable the plot idea of her old employer wanting her so much she is an object of love an object of desire a very believable concept br br fans of vivian wu may want to check out an outstanding b movie she is in from a couple years back called dinner rush dinner rush is highly recommended encrypt is not
<START> i have just seen this movie and have not read the book the good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject evolution sincronicity and your part in the world br br however the movie's immersion is easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters it is very clear that the book looses a lot in this movie version the events that were suppose to show sincronicity taking place are almost unrecognizable a lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose br br enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to do you recall the enlightenment with keanu reeves in little buddha well this is nothing like that br br most scenes are poorly executed there are a lot of scenes that really don't develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere br br the better actors in this movie namely hector elizondo joaquim de almeida and jÃ¼rgen prochnow cannot save it the first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie and because they were paid more but this does not work most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all br br jÃ¼rgen does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy as always but the script does not help him at all the scene where he first tries to convince john matthew settle to join him is just bad script the execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad executed the flashbacks throughout the movie cannot even be commented br br overall this movie is a big waist of time read the book i have not read it but it is probably a billion times better than this it has to be br br it is so bad that i had to write my first comment in imdb
<START> the writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable basic elements such as character development were glossed over at best inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads a massive mansion in the middle of the rural irish countryside characters just showing up in the gardens during a stormy night at very convenient times i might add all in all it wasn't bad i rated it a 4 based mostly on the story and talent of alison elliott
<START> not even bob hope escorted by a raft of fine character actors can save this poorly written attempt at wartime comedy as his patented timing has little which which to work the plot involves a hollywood film star named don bolton hope and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of world war ii followed by his enlistment by mistake in a confused attempt to court a colonel's daughter dorothy lamour bolton's agent played by lynne overman and his assistant portrayed by eddie bracken enlist with him and the three are involved in various escapades regarding training exercises filmed in the malibu california hills paramount budgeted handsomely for this effort employing some of its top specialists but direction by the usually reliable david butler was flaccid and this must be attributed to a missing comedic element in the scenario a shift toward the end of the film to create an opportunity for heroism by bolton is still born with poor stunt work and camera action in evidence oddly lynne overman is given the best lines and this veteran master of the sneer does very well by them dorothy lamour looks lovely and acts nicely as well and it is ever a delight to see and hear clarence kolb as her father whose voice is unique on screen or radio but there is little they can do to save this film cursed as it is with an error in script assignment
<START> bad plot bad dialogue bad acting idiotic directing the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script and a crappy copy of the vhs cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor trust me because i stuck this turkey out to the end it was so pathetically bad all over that i had to figure it was a fourth rate spoof of springtime for hitler br br the girl who played janis joplin was the only faint spark of interest and that was only because she could sing better than the original br br if you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better then watch beyond the valley of the dolls
<START> it is an almost ideal romantic anime must see for all ages but the english dubbed version is not too good perhaps the 1999 version will be better
<START> i almost made a fool of myself when i was going to start this review by saying this movie reminded me of billy elliot but then i looked up the resume of screenwriter lee hall only to find out that he was the guy who wrote billy elliot so it's mr hall who's making a fool of himself not me br br am i being a bit cruel on him no because lee has something most other aspiring screenwriters from britain don't have he has his foot in the door he has previously written a successful british movie that won awards and made money at the box office and what does he do next he gives the audience more of the same br br young jimmy spud lives on some kitchen sink estate he is bullied at school and no one loves him the only thing keeping him going is that he has aspirations to be a ballet dancer no actually he has aspirations to be an angel but considering his household he may as well be a ballet dancer he has a macho waster of a father who thinks ballet dancers are a bunch of poofs while his granddad says ballet dancers are as tough as any man you could meet i remember seeing the bolshoi ballet yup ballet is a main talking point on a run down british council estate those days not come to think of it neither is left wing politics which seems to be the sole preserve of middle class do gooders who live in nice big houses so right away everything about this set up feels ridiculously false br br another major criticism is that this is a film that has no clue who it's trying to appeal to i have often criticised channel 4 for broadcasting movies at totally inappropriate times the land that time forgot at 6 am for example but they showed this at 2 am and for once they've got it spot on considering the story involves politics ballet dancing gawd i hate it lung cancer and poverty there's no way this can be deemed suitable for a family audience but since the main protagonist is an 11 year old child and features angels and ballet dancers don't blame me if i seem obsessed with the subject there was no need to refer to them there's not much here for an intelligent adult audience either br br of course if lee hall had been told at the script development stage by the producers that he should write a story featuring a schoolboy and an angel and had flatly refused saying that he wanted to write about other themes and stories then i will apologise but throughout the movie you do get the feeling that once the film was completed it was going to be marketed to the exact same audience who enjoyed billy elliot
<START> for persons of a certain age w w ii was the defining time of their lives and whatever followed could never compare as the movie opens a recently widowed but still lively woman judi dench hears a street musician gamely attempting to play the classic song stardust br br this recalls her memories of when she played in an almost all girl band that entertained between bomb raids during the war the drummer patrick ian holm happily avoided the draft and enjoyed the ladies br br patrick and dench's character meet and decide to reunite the band which takes them on a series of mini adventures despite ups and downs the band does reunite and makes a successful reappearance br br the movie is exquisitely written and understated with superb performances from all involved the characters are well developed and all people who have not quit living despite their years and there's all that glorious old swing music br br this isn't the pontification of steven spielberg but a serious movie nevertheless the war affected everyone and that lesson is not forgotten in a movie that isn't afraid to entertain as it teaches
<START> having seen cube i've been a fan of vincenzo natali's work natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster instead he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways so much in fact that you may in fact believe there is this cube were people try to escape or in the case of nothing a large empty expanse where there is nothing the advert had me hooked instantly it seemed so simple take two characters who no one likes and send them to a world where there is nothing natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist in fact the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film there's nothing there but also 'something' there br br it might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading i was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so therefore upon watching the film i laughed every now and again whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confused br br if i may take a minute to give the film some praise where the film excels on is the concept it is a genius concept to have a world of nothing and to put two characters there not two brilliant minded characters who will philosophise and work out their surroundings but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are another strong point is the film's cinematography though at first this may not seem it where each wall north earth south west up and down is just a white plane a perception of depth becomes faulty it is hard to determine where things are placed in the mis en scene the cinematography has many moments where this actually happens but for the most part the camera is placed so that two characters or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background allowing a sense of depth to be realised br br however this film does lack in certain areas the film is relatively short but even so after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot we can also argue that the acting is once again questionable these two characters are in a sense unlikeable therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters however on a flip side of that the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough but there is something lacking br br even so i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another science fiction horror film it is much more of a comedy than that it is indeed worth watching though purely for the concept itself
