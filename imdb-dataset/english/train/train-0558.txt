<START> while the sparkling chemistry between ryan and robbins alone is reason enough to see this movie the supporting cast including matthau fry shalub durning and the hilarious trio of jacobi saks and maher is an additional plus matthau shines as einstein fry is perfect as ryan's clinical fiancÃ© and shalub's line about einstein's gonads is as has been noted one of the highlights of the film the speech that robbins delivers at his first appearance in public is sheer poetry kudos to the writers for handling this froth with wit and levity i also thought that keene curtis was wonderful as eisenhower this might be considered something of a chick movie but i think everyone will get a kick out of it eight very solid points
<START> four porn stars romping through the irish woods sounds like a film to watch we have ginger lynn allen chasey lain taylor hayes and jenna jameson all together in one film are you licking your lips well the mutant creatures who resulted from centuries of inbreeding were certainly licking their lips as they feasted on the entrails of their victims br br yes there was some flesh exposed far too little considering the cast but it was soon ripped open to expose dinner for these creatures there was definitely some action that probably has not been seen before and more than one person lost their head in the situation br br unfortunately director christian viel did not show much promise and i am not likely to watch his later efforts
<START> the point of wolfe's original novel indeed the point of the whole story is that things take place because of a carefully calculated sense of expediency the goal is survival within a particular kind of life style the novel is full of malice the only relationship that rings emotionally true is that between sherman and his daughter campbell and that's only touched upon that aside everyone is out for what he can get in the way of publicity power money or self aggrandizement br br wolfe was criticized for hitting every character and every social segment of new york city over the head his response was a denial after all he lived in new york himself and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations exactly the qualifications one would want on his resume in order to deny that he disliked new yorkers wolfe has a phd in american studies from yale and is no dummy those supposed weaknesses are what made the novel memorable nobody was any good and sherman mccoy wound up broke a professional protester for social justice the movie throws all of that away and imposes a moral frame on the story that simply doesn't fit wolfe did his homework the novel was rooted in reality every event was not only possible but thoroughly believable wolfe might have made a great cultural anthropologist he knows how to get inside a system and record its details br br yes any of us might have found ourselves as sherman and his mistress do stuck in the south bronx threatened by a couple of black kids and making a getaway after bumping into one of them that scene is transferred neatly from print to celluloid br br but after that scene the movie seems not to trust its audience and at times become frantic in its attempt to spell out its message however nebulous the message is br br sherman might accidentally hit some kid and be arrested for it as he is in the novel but he would not immediately upon his release from jail go back to his phenomenally expensive condo take out a shotgun and start shooting into the ceiling with it as he does in the movee in what's supposed to be a funny scene ceiling plaster falls all over the party guests and they scurry away shrieking it simply would not have happened the movie has left the novel's unspeakably detailed reality in the dust wolfe's sensibility the work he put into capturing the real has been lost what we get instead is a noisy fantastic and silly scene that doesn't do anything except wake the audience up similar empty scenes follow screaming out for wolfe's verisimilitude br br the movie also fails because it thrusts a lot of sin and redemption into an entertaining story of moral nihilism here we see don juan in hell at the opera we get lectures on redemption from a poet with aids we see a lot of guilt in sherman a black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of those final speeches about how we all have to start behaving nicely again a reporter who feels sorry for sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb and a happy ending in which sherman gets off by breaking the law with an idiotic grin the scene sits on the movie like a jester's cap on a circus elephant's head br br the movie not only makes points that are already trite and unoriginal it overstates them as if the audience were incapable of absorbing any subtleties br br it's not the acting or the direction that's poor the film's not bad in those respects and the photography is pretty good too including two rather spectacular shots the gargoyles of the chrysler building and the landing of the concorde it's the script that is thoroughly botched br br the first half of the movie roughly is okay in conception and execution it keeps some of the little details from the novel sherman and judy's dog is named marshall who the hell would name a dog marshall it loses its focus almost completely in the second half and on the whole is barely worth watching br br wolfe's cynical redneck right wingism may be offensive to a lot of people but he's got the cojones to lay his percepts out alas the writers and producers did not have the courage to pick them up and thus blew the chance to make a fascinating study of new yorkers
<START> this is a decent endeavor but the guy who wrote the screenplay seems to be a bit in the dark as to what exactly makes a zombie movie cool no it isn't cgi bugs and software companies actually i'm not sure whether it was a software company i saw it without subtitles so i had to guess what they're talking about anyway my point was instead of wasting your time animating some dumb ass bug why not throw in more zombies and more action 2 3 of the 20 minutes consist of news bulletins bugs some guys yelling about something and to makes matters worse more boring most of the deaths occur off screen i realize that's all too common for no budget movies but then there were some very impressive effects well kind a of which left me wondering why did the director or screenwriter whatever chose to focus on how the epidemic started it's a short nobody's gonna care anyway
<START> this movie let me down decidedly hard it was a great concept that was ruined with a horrible script the story just didn't flow and was disjointed at best there were so many elements to this story that were not explained or were forced into place with out any real thought elements like the love story could have been expanded on a bit more and the cannons need to be written in better the whole main character growing up thing needed more about the training he was receiving and less standing around everyone likes a good little guy overcomes story and this showed promise but with the scripting failures wasn't to be while it did have some pyrotechnics in the final battle sequence it was lackluster due to a lack of choreography this made for a maddeningly boring watch br br it could have been so good
<START> the only remarkable fact is the participation of klaus kinski who plays a priest don't ask me why he does it a bad bad movie overall br br
<START> one of the five worst movies i have ever watched and i'm not exaggerating in fact i recommend watching it so you can get the same feeling of incredulity as you might by watching showgirls br br out of 400 votes the movie gets a user rating of 5 3 10 but there is a disproportionate number of voters who gave it a 10 10 probably due to the message of the movie nuclear weapons are the bane of mankind chuck murdock is an all star little league pitcher who gives up baseball because there are nuclear weapons soon amazing grace smith is an all star boston celtic who is inspired by chuck's story and gives up basketball soon all sports leagues from the professional level to college to high school to little league dismantle in a world wide protest later all the children of the world go on a silence strike this inspires the president of the united states to meet with the soviet premier who in time agree to eliminate all nuclear weapons in time for the start of the next little league season the movie ends with chuck about to throw out the first pitch with the president telling his new best friend chuck not to worry about striking out every batter as he hasn't thrown a baseball in a year br br somewhere along the line a nefarious underworld boss kills amazing grace when the president finds out he is told that the fbi can verify the killer but will never be able to prove it so the president calls the underworld boss but it's one a m i don't care get him on the line and tell him that he is to resign from all company boards that he sits on and sell all stocks that he has and to not get out of line again br br honestly this movie was so crappy that i couldn't turn it off it was on television from 2 30 am to 4 00 am and i watched it all i wasn't turned off by the anti nuclear weapons propaganda i was turned off by the implausible break down of all organized sports i don't even understand why amazing grace smith was killed and with all these famous athletes becoming chuck's friends why the father was constantly upset with his son taking a principled stand and there was the clichÃ© moment near the end when dad tells chuck i never told you this but i'm proud of you cue hug
<START> imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one 90 minute movie now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity now imagine something 50 times worse br br got that br br ok now go see the underground comedy movie that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever ucm is the single worst movie i've ever seen there were a few cheap laughs very few but it was lame even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be funny br br the only reason i'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it he wasted his money vince offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it's no surprise why
<START> this kind of inspirational saccharine is enough to make you sick it telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth it removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it the big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car i guess you'd need such prompting to feel if you're stupid enough to watch a film as simple minded and sappy as this streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it's just that a display switched on and off like a light because i can't for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film even though it's based on a true story and an inspirational one at that i'm sure the set up execution and performances play like a third rate tv movie or half witted high school drama
<START> br br superb film with no actual spoken dialogue which enhances the level of suspense the whole approach gives a completely different twist to a war film br br well worth watching again if only it could be found i saw it perhaps 20 or so years ago fantastic
<START> tweaked a little bit 'nothing' could be a children's film it's a very clever concept touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes and goes against pretty much every hollywood convention you can think of what goes against everything more than literally nothing nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives all that's left is what they don't hate and a big empty white space it's hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot it focuses on pretty much one subject but that's prime vincenzo natali territory if you've seen 'cube' you know already that he tends to like that type of situation the nothing in this movie is apparently infinite space but natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic if only because there's literally nothing else and nowhere else to go the actors sell it although you can tell these guys are friends anyway two actors from 'cube' return here worth and kazan but are entirely different characters they change throughout the story and while they're not the strongest actors in the world they're at least believable br br the reason i say this could be a children's film under the right tweaks is because aside from a few f bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids so i find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore especially considering there isn't very much of it this could've gotten a pg rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue there is very little objectionable about this film but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it i only say that's a shame because not because i support censorship but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure br br at any rate this is a reasonably entertaining film albeit with a few dragged out scenes but for literally being about nothing and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film
<START> this was an absolutely terrible movie don't be lured in by christopher walken or michael ironside both are great actors but this must simply be their worst role in history even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline this movie is an early nineties us propaganda piece the most pathetic scenes were those when the columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions maria conchita alonso appeared phony and her pseudo love affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning i am disappointed that there are movies like this ruining actor's like christopher walken's good name i could barely sit through it
<START> what an amazingly funny and original show the cast starting with the hysterical julie brown homecoming queen's got a gun is just perfect add amy hill all american girl grandma kim who plays a lesbian who is always arguing with her partner and business partner asian restaurant wok don t run i have laughed harder during this show than any other i have ever seen including newhart one of my all time favorite shows if you like movies like naked gun and airplane you will love this series one of the best moments of the show is cindy williams playing herself when she snubs tammy at the dry cleaners tammy finds a picture of cindy williams in her coat the picture is of cindy williams doing an unmentionable act with a bowling pin upside down it is awesome to see an actress like cindy williams being able to play herself like this soap opera like with many surprise twists during its short run i can only hope that this will someday be released on dvd with special many bonus special features funniest series i have ever seen
<START> sorry this movie is just a cheap tv production i saw very much promotion material and expect a professionell movie like stormriders what i was presented was a low budget movie like xena or hercules on tv no atmosphere very boring more then worse fight scenes some good ideas not more i hope i will get the chance to make a movie like this and then i show how to do such a movie br br my asian tips musa the warrior stormriders shaolin soccer battle royal versus etc br br sorry for my bad english
<START> while the idea is more original than most sci fi movies the execution is as usual lacking while the practical mummy effects are not bad and the gun nut character is over the top giggle inducing the only real draw is to see morena baccarin and adam baldwin reunited on the small screen i suspect that was the idea all along they do the best they can with what they have but the must see moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when morena's character sported some tomb raider style shorts not high brow cinema i know but you can't deny true beauty when you see it and adam baldwin once again hams it up as the guy you love to hate if you just want to watch a couple of your favorite firefly characters have a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you if you want good acting and character development then be advised to look elsewhere
<START> definitely needed a little work in season 2 such as the virus between max and logan and ames white along with his ancient super cult during season two however the only thing that kept me watching was to see if max and logan would ever get rid of the nasty virus infecting max very good drama in season two but of course like all tv shows if there's something a little wrong with it the broadcasting company takes it off the air i was seriously hoping for a third and final season season 2 leaves you hanging unless you read the books by max allan collins then you will know what happens br br dark angel should be put back on the air for one more season even though it might cost a lot just to get all the original actors again since jessica alba's carrier sky rocketed after the show if that would be the case then there should be a movie to complete it just like the show firefly which of course fox canceled as well
<START> i've seen all kinds of hamlet s br br kenneth branagh's was most ambitious mel gibson's was quick and to the point laurence olivier's was the best hands down but now we come to maximilian schell's take on the bard br br for one this is a dubbed version of a german tv production of william shakespeare's venerable chestnut but if there's a slower more plodding more lethargic and worse staged version out there somewhere it must have been acted at grade school level br br having seen it on mst3k helps with mike and the robots taking jolly good jabs at the old boy puncturing the profundity of black and white tv shakespeare and the wisdom of germans acting out an english play and making it look like an ingmar bergman reject br br of course the best parts are the mst riffs best lines i'm gonna unleash the great dane i don't think so 'breather' meet the beatles hey dad will you help me with my science project and my personal favorite during a party garrison keillor's leaving germany yaaay br br but then there's schell playing shakespeare's greatest character much like a department store mannequin would only not as expressive no doubt he's a great actor but here he comes off about as well as paul newman in the silver chalice ever see that one you gotta watch these two on a double bill br br in the end this is one instance where it's true that you're much better off to just read the book at least the book isn't dubbed by ricardo montalban br br one star only for this hamlet ten stars naturally for the mst3k version br br good night not so sweet prince
<START> i was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a bernard malamud story this is basically a story of possible redemption racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust br br a black jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife if morris mishkin zero mostel will only believe in the angel belafonte his wife fanny ida kaminska will recover the problem is that morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that belafonte is an angel br br when he believes it fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and fanny suffers accordingly it would have been very nice if there had been an english translation in the last scene when a dying fanny speaks to morris br br jan kadar who successfully directed miss kaminska in her oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966's the shop on main street directs this film as well kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn't convey the desperate situation that she faces she keeps calling for ruthie their daughter who disobeyed them by marrying out of the jewish religion for most of the film she does not realize the angel's appearance in her apartment br br the scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the angel's girl friend confronts belafonte in their apartment is memorable but all too brief br br we don't know why belafonte is in danger and why he has died br br those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation
<START> robert mitchum stars as clint tollinger in this short but tough western man with the gun tollinger is a professional town tamer as in when a town needs someone to save itself he is the one who is brought in to do it tollinger's latest gig comes by as an accident strolling into town looking for his former fling he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster but many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired tollinger as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing suddenly high plains drifter seems less original br br man with the gun starts off as an average western tough guy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses what starts off as forgettable and run of the mill ends up dark and character centered the entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable mitchum is his usual excellent self here in man with the gun not one of his very best performances mitchum still has his classic and effective tough guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action packed meaningful and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park man with the gun is a nice mitchum western and is easily worth one's time
<START> note to horror fans the only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthless it's insulting br br i watched this because br br the premise sounded slightly promising it's not it's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low budget slasher films that weren't good either br br the promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful it's not it's so not the amateur cinematography makes sure the fallen angels are about as sexy as the average homeless person br br the name tom savini has a long history in the horror genre he's the king of low budget special effects and lower budget acting come to think of it savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie it's not that he's bad but he's almost always in bad movies his only good role was in from dusk till dawn and he's been milking that at horror conventions ever since br br but let's focus on the positive forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie br br everything else is a negative obviously the writer is allergic to originality the script is terrible that's all a given after the first 10 minutes but the clueless pacing the way the director treats plot and characterization as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway and the excruciatingly long and boring driving walking and nature sequences no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general br br this is another good example of the number one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad if it's written and directed by the same person expect garbage
