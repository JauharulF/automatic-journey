<START> surviving christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released ben affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for christmas he then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for christmas cheer i have not been a ben affleck fan in the past though i did like daredevil and paycheck but here he is well cast in this role i also like christina applegate as the daughter in the family who can't stand affleck's character at first sure you can see where this movie is going but you don't care ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of christmas movies
<START> you all know the story of hamlet i do br br well the to be or not to be phrase not the speech itself has been beaten into the ground so many times that it's not very interesting in fact it wasn't that great to begin with in fact i find hamlet a good but vastly overrated play it's not even shakespeare's best julius caesar and romeo juliet are ten times better with a midsummer night's dream and othello not too far behind macbeth knock your table off his drawers puck will make amends ow isn't that bad either there are lots of others that are better than this by shakespeare br br i won't really comment too much on the movie rather i will dissect the utterly horrible mst3k episode br br okay mike and the bots win a card game get to pick the movie they ask for hamlet pearl sends them this yadda yadda yadda and prepare for the most boring sci fi episode of mst3k ever admittedly i haven't seen any of the cc ones br br while blood waters of dr z makes the viewing of that episode horrible since it is not really a movie rather random spliced together scenes i'm reminded of mike's line from future war maybe this is an anthology of short plotless movies the sol crew a lot got off a good many good cracks can't say the same for here br br the riffs fall flat the host segments par usual are at best mediocre and when the movie itself which isn't that bad is actually better i mean as a quality movie not as camp like prince of space than the mst3k version of it you know the show must be bad i laughed the last time i saw it was several months ago oh maybe eight or nine times throughout i tried and tried and tried to be entertained but i just couldn't only the occasional line like hail queen dilbert's boss and when that's the funniest line of the episode well ahem and by occasional i mean every ten minutes or so maybe me even chuckle the second time i tried to watch it i didn't even laugh at the few jokes i'd found funny before and simply gave up forty minutes before br br the movie isn't horrible it's just a german version of hamlet the actors are good enough and though the dubbing isn't the greatest that's not in itself a reason to hate this film br br four stars for hamlet three yes three for the mst3k version br br ps why why why mst3k
<START> in a variant of sholay ram gopal verma ventures into what can be called an unknown territory where the blockbuster takes a new shape the thakur goes south mohanlal as narsimha the police inspector whose family has been killed seeks vengeance madrasi style the accent is totally south indian in contrast to thakur from the north the severing of the hands of thakur by gabbar is also cut down to the fingers in aag so make up costs are cut down because there is no effort to hide the hands instead only a long shouldered kurta covers up for the cut fingers moreso in the climax where the thakur uses his legs and says tere liye to mere paer hi kaafi hai here narsimha uses his finger stubs to fire a gun and kill the villain babban the new avtar of gabbar is also different he is not from bihar or up he is bambaiya gabbar's infamous laugh is also in two instalments this time and is more subdued babban asks for diwali instead of holi and romances urmila the replacement of helen in mehbooba he also dances and enjoys dancing with abhisheh who plays jalal agha in mehbooba babban is more intelligent this time he tosses the apple and asks the question that made isaac newton discover laws of gravitation basanti is more verbose than the auto driver ghungroo nisha kothari cannot play the auto driver and looks too artificial using words like 'entertain' and 'too much' with gay abandon viru was fun whereas ajay devgun is a misfit for the role the god speaks to basanti incident and the shooting lessons and the koi haseena song and the water tank sequences are painful the water tank turns into a well and the drunk devgun is so bad in the sequence that the audience would have wanted him to commit suicide jai was composed and serious prashant raj is better than the others because we do not expect anything from him but he also bungles on the mausi sequence he is not as romantic as jai with the mouth organ jaya's role played by sushmita changes careers a pure housewife turns into a doctor this time plunging into full time social service after her husband is killed she too lacks the pain that jaya displayed her flirtations with jai are more open this time samba gets a bigger role this time as tambe he does not have to point guns and answer questions of gabbar this time he follows babban wherever he goes and is a bodyguard with more visibility outside the den horses give way to jeeps and auto the gabbar's hideout here keeps changing and ramgarh becomes kaliganj all in all it is more of a spoof than anything else rgv comes up with his own interpretation of the classic but we remember the original so well even after three decades that our minds refuse to accept stylized versions and changed dialogues so we call it a spoof so mr rgv sholay and farhan akhtar don and jpdutta umrao jaan stop making remixes and start making originals
<START> it's impossible for me to objectively consider this movie not that i haven't tried mind you but i sit down and i pop in the aged vhs and i watch the opening and suddenly i'm five years old again and clutching my very own care bear and watching the movie with open eyes and an eager heart br br i can see objectively that this movie is a bizarre combination of cuddly baby merchandising mascots and creepy prepubescent children with evil powers that has a thin story and uninteresting animation but my inner five year old goes yay care bears every time i think about it so i'd only cautiously reluctantly recommend this movie for those who saw it during their early youth and can call on the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it like me or those lovably cynical gen x y ers who deliberately seek out the wonderfully bad strange a category in which this movie definitely belongs to those actually looking for a compelling movie or wholesome family entertainment you might want to keep looking
<START> didn't mystic pizza win the oscar for that year this movie never had a chance due to the casting but perhaps by now people can see why i felt that way upon leaving the theater only wargames left me feeling similarly disturbed after leaving the theater with the feeling i was getting a glimpse of our future history has shown that this is exactly what happened br br the casting is a pop culture cuisinart of the 1980s you get arnold as ben richards the framed fugitive offered a chance to run for his freedom on the game show with the same title as the movie richard dawson as damon killian treating his role as if he were the host of family feud with the contestants using real guns jesse ventura as captain freedom and co wrestler professor tanaka as subzero both stalkers who kill the running men even mick fleetwood mic and dweezil zappa stevie show up while the dancers of the future are none other than the laker girls this movie screams 80s the plot is a good excuse for the action ben richards is determined to prove his innocence but agrees to be the running man when he is told that his buddies would be set free instead they join him as contestants maria conchita alonzo as amber mendez is the standard by which one can properly judge salma hayek in the 1990s br br the production value on the film was a bit poor the lines were cheesy and at the time the plot seemed a bit far fetched i remember thinking when i was leaving the theater that we were definitely heading in the direction of the film but who could have seen how far we'd go there and how fast if the running man were listed in tv guide most people would assume it were just another reality show pushing the envelope today the government influences on the media have only gotten worse and the dumbed down american public of the future that surrenders all of its freedoms for national security is downright chilling ben richards is played brilliantly by arnold as one of the few remaining holdouts against a government tyranny that the rest of america is all too willing to accept in return for good television and some parting gifts for the audience br br the movie was way over the top maybe even off the cliff for its time but as with back to the future iii the ravine it appeared to be sinking itself into in 1987 was replaced by completed tracks in 2006 and beyond and this movie will sail into the future as one of the more prophetic films of our time it is tragic that as with wargames the academy did not give this brilliant screenplay the recognition it deserved serious actors acting seriously while being so pretentious that you want to throw up may win more oscars but that doesn't make them better films than their common man counterparts such as this one br br an absolute must see
<START> i heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80's movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see well i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as april fools day friday 13th and prom night this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting instead the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste i was disappointed in his part in the end as far as the true identity of the killer goes when the identity was released as to who he was i just laughed but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but don't spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory
<START> this is by far the worst adaptation of jane eyre i have seen it is uncertain whether or not the writer of the screenplay ever read the book by bronte george c scott is ridiculous and bumbling as rochester when not just plain old acting angry susannah york has the most dated 1970's hairstyle i have ever seen in a victorian movie the characters hardly speak to each other so the rich banter enjoyed in the book that is the basis for their deep intellectual and abiding love is gone the ending is ludicrous br br please rent the timothy dalton version instead it is so true to the book it's like having the novel read aloud to you dalton is superb as rochester g c scott is laughable
<START> how good is gwyneth paltrow this is the right movie for her too bad she's completely out role i haven't read the book by jane austen but i can't believe it is so superficial and the characters aren't much more than caricatures it wasn't probably that easy to reduce in 2 hours of show about 600 pages of the book but i had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups i was taking a sigh of relief every time i saw an actor who didn't overstep the mark of overacting a couple of times
<START> i can't believe i waste my time watching this garbage i did because leonard maltin gave it an aa rating and for tv movies this is usually a reliable indicator of some quality entertainment br br the acting was ok but whoever wrote it should be forever denied access to any medium of communication the plot is ludicrous the motivations of the bad guys totally absent and the various family interactions silly and shallow for example dad preaches that violent reaction to aggression is bad but he turns out to be an admirable person not because of his ignore the idiots philosophy but because he's pretty good with his fists br br the only message i was able to glean from this pap was that the nuclear family is good and alternate living arrangements are bad oh and bad people happen to good people
<START> i was deeply moved by this movie in many respects first of all i just want to say that clara lago was the most precious little thing such a pretty little girl her acting was superb as well true to life and very human though i don't like the part where she had to smoke i hope it was only a fake prop either way she was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving i found myself immersed in the story and her character br br it's quite interesting how i came to discover this movie actually i was walking in blockbuster and i just happened to notice her pretty smile on the cover as i was walking by luckily i glanced in the downward direction that this movie was in i thought to myself 'awe look at her ' so i picked it up and saw that this movie was described as such wonderful things as a little gem i read the plot on the back and then thought that well maybe i'd look it up on imdb first and then come back and rent it at a later time i'm glad i didn't because i certainly would have been missing out after searching for a movie with my friend i knew that i would end up regretting not renting this film so i went back to the spot in which i originally found it and snapped it up br br it had been on my dresser for a week since school started for me this week and i really hadn't any time to watch it but tonight was the perfect opportunity i popped it in and was glued to the beautiful cinematography delightful score and moving plot from beginning to end i was so captivated and must say some parts nearly moved me to tears br br i would also like to make a special mention for the young boy in this film juan jose ballesta he was remarkable also the actor who played carol's father who's name is unfortunately not listed on the site his voice was just so loving and gentle that i could really sense his love for carol even though his appearance is not prominent i really felt his character's presence br br this is truly a wonderful movie if you are a person who is moved by light but emotional films then this is definitely one for you
<START> i watched an episode yes i sat through the entire miserable experience and i have to say this brand of comedy is one of the worst you will get imagine peter griffin of family guy fame now imagine peter griffin as a admittedly slim and minus the glasses woman except that he now lacks the something that made him hilarious peter griffin is an idiot but he doesn't know he's an idiot sarah has none of the genuine character none of the acting ability to pull her character off maybe its the trite formulaic jokes that pull her comedy even lower than her character can take it by herself maybe it's the lack of believable foils her insensitive bigoted persona may appeal to insensitive bigoted people unlike the mass appeal that stephen colbert's insensitive bigoted character has like bill o'reilly sarah creates an annoying unfunny character she lacks something that is necessary for the genre of satire let alone for the entire world of comedy what sarah silverman lacks its noticeable and when you don't believe it and identify with it it's not funny anymore
<START> the story and music george gershwin are wonderful as are levant guetary foch and of course kelly one thing's missing and that thing is a good leading lady i'm sorry leslie caron bothers me anyway despite her the plot moves along nicely with the famous and deservedly so ballet oh the colours the dazzling reds blues greens and yellows musn't forget the beiges as well i just adore the contrast between the beaux arts ball completely black and white costumes and the ever so brilliant ballet br br so i suppose what i'm trying to say is this please by all means see it and enjoy it because though it isn't the best it is marvelous but be sure not to forget that other gene kelly musical with the 20 year old girl that was catapulted to stardom just afterward
<START> the film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in it is well made and very powerful the persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological perspective i believe it give great insight into a sub culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society it is shocking at times and more powerful because of it some parts were difficult to watch as most reality is but it is not over done its good the first time you watch it but it becomes even better the second or third time around because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge
<START> the writers and producers of this little outing have plummeted new depths of depravity did writer's block set in so badly or had ideas dried up so much that they were forced to include a disgusting scene where a young woman defecates in the back seat of a van and then promptly throws the excrement at the car behind mind you at least this summarises what this film is worth we had already been treated to one of the other women urinating over one of her friends at gunpoint as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting once would have sufficed we got the message this really is taking toilet humour to another level had the script and acting been better then i could have easily forgotten that i was watching a film shot entirely on low budget video this was a fairly original storyline with a clever the only piece of direction in that we only ever got to take the viewpoint from inside of the van thus making it feel much more real we never got to see inside any other locations such as the store or the field where several of the women disappeared and this could have added much needed tension br br the script was dire lines like 'i don't feel too good i want to go home' after one of the girls has been pursued by a psychopath subjected to rape by a screwdriver and shot at seem a little undercooked br br the acting was diabolical apart from the maniac did all the main 5 actresses in this learn acting by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike the sound was so bad that i had to watch the entire film with the subtitles on br br the director seemed to have an easy job in this it seems that the only direction he must have given was 'scream girls' br br and as for the screaming if you watch this please be sure to have some paracetamol at the ready
<START> the plot of this movie hangs on one important point that this murderer was also a responsible loving caring father not that being a father and a murderer is impossible but this man is shown murdering a teenage girl without provocation or reason and without emotion this girl was someone's daughter i don't think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so cold blooded to someone else's daughter or alternately could have been so cold blooded and yet worry about and care for his own daughter and the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask his victim's parents to take in and care for his daughter is beyond belief br br that said the characters were acted with conviction by the actors i thought changing scott bakula's eye color did make him seem more cold and menacing than he usually is you couldn't see into his eyes at all
<START> without question one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s gaots seems to really really want to be something important the tragic truth is that it's so entirely valueless on every level that one can't help but laugh reaching in desperation for the earthy elements of ingmar bergman's films it follows a city couple's day in the wilderness they walk along a shady path allthewhile pontificating like a u c berkeley coffee clatch almost every line of tarradiddle dialog delivered here is uproariously bad i feel that life itself is made up of as many tiny compartments as this pomegranate but is it as beautiful after what seems like an eternity of absolutely nothing happening well ok we are treated to some nudity and a tepid soft sex scene there is finally a very anticlimactic confrontation involving a pair 'nam vets who are making the nature scene and performing some pretty harsh folk ballads with an acoustic guitar br br nothing at all eventful or interesting happens in this entire film i thought the larry buchanan picture strawberries need rain was a weak example of a bergman homage golden apples is every bit as bad but the ceaseless random verbiage it presents makes it memorably awful 1 10
<START> as a youth pastor i heard good things about this movie then i watched it the acting wasn't the best that's forgivable it's the message that's not give jesus your life and everything will change you'll tackle better make amazing catches stop fumbling start making touchdown passes and even make the playoffs all because jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into all american athletes i laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals but wait that's not all you'll get a brand new truck a 6000 raise and you and your wife's struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy twice then you'll win the state championship because god helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he's ever kicked before and into the wind no less all because god wanted him to make it then you'll win the state championship again the next year none of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadn't chosen to follow jesus will all their hearts br br here's what i took away from the movie god can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it and it's all about making our lives better easier and more enjoyable he chooses his favorite team and helps them win games which bible is this story based on i'll bet saint stephen wished he'd known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following jesus it would have saved them all a lot of trouble
<START> that '70s show is definitely the funniest show currently on tv i started watching it about two and a half years ago and as soon as i saw it i could tell it was a great show i like all the characters but my personal favorites are fez and kelso leo was also an awesome character while he was there i really hope he comes back because he's hilarious it's classic when fez goes you son of a bitch and when kelso yells burn that always makes me laugh they are both great characters and always have something funny to say jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show she started out being really good looking but damn somewhere around season 5 6 she just got really hot i've seen most of the episodes more than once some like 10 times and there still hilarious this is one of the few shows that i can watch over and over and still laugh at just as much as i did the first time i saw it the cast is classic almost everyone is funny where with many shows there are only a few funny characters i will be sad to see this show end next year but it will be going off the air as one of the best shows ever
<START> this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best at the same time it looks realistic and unrealistic just knowing that the movie is fake the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address and it includes a manga video showing the torture the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die some scenes are shocking such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched 100 times because you see punches in nearly every movie this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people 17 or older br br 9 10
<START> the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most movergoers were stay at homes watching their new 7 motorola televisions almost all recent box office figures are false because they fail to adjust inflation obviously today's 10 movies will dominate in 1951 it cost 90c to 1 60 at radio city 44c to 75c first run at loew's palace in washington dc or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs what counts is the number of people responding to the picture not unadjusted box office media spin the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso really not a great story anyway and threw it in the trash instead 90 of the movie's focus was on the music thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best ever historic opera singer enrico caruso the result was a wonderful movie too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating too fat to play the student prince edmund purdom took his place with lanza's voice dubbed in and with the formerly handsome and not fat lanza pictured in the advertising if you want to see the great caruso it's almost always on ebay for 2 00 or less don't be put off by the low price as it reflects only the easy availability of copies not the quality of the movie
