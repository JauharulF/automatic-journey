<START> journey to the center of the earth is the story of some tourists of hawaii three of them siblings and one of them a young british nanny babysitting a dog when the siblings accidentally drive off in their jeep with the basket of dog biscuits the nanny follows them it might've just been safer to purchase more all the way to the cave the siblings intended to explore i guess for some reason they actually go in the cave and then when the place starts caving in they try to get out to no avail except for the six year old sister who they tell to go get help meanwhile the more they move around in the cave the more they continue to plummet further and further towards the earths cavernous core and behold it is here where they find the city of atlantis and its bizarre alien habitants who are living under the oppressive rule of one alien that doesn't want them asking to many questions about the worlds external to their own br br i see that rusty lemorande the named director of the film has provided comments on this film in which he explains that part of latter half of this film is actually the sequel to alien in l a well whatever it was it was an amazingly cheap movie that i would rank only slightly higher than city limits a 1988 sci fi film also made on a non existent budget because at the least ending of this dreadful piece of mostly incoherent film making that cuts corners where it can aims for some humor and amusement in the last 20 minutes when we finally see what life is like in the alien world at the center of the earth i also give it a two star rating rather than one because it was at times funny even if only in its subtleties for example the aliens asks the british girl if she's an alien and she explains that the ministry should be sending her work visa shortly or when the alien girl finds bryan and explains that he is in the city of altantis and he mistakes this for atlantic city new jersey little things like that make the idiocy of the first hour or so tolerable imagine how great the film could've been though if they had 1 actually intended to make it and 2 actually had money to make it br br i do like how in the end no one wonders what happened to the little sister who was sent away in the beginning to get help she'd just be wandering around the hawaiian caves and not too far from the erupting volcano mind you
<START> even thought i'm not the biggest of cher fans this movie was her crowning achievement granted there were long term side effects and risks of brain damage memory loss and intellectual impairment upon the screening such a film a 1989 survey of moonstruck fans by the uk advocacy network revealed that one third of 300 moonstruck fans surveyed believed moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80 claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds br br cher plays someone very un cher in this movie a dowdy young widow named loretta living in new york with her extended family they're anti american pro italian and always at each other in someway she has been going out with johnny camarary for a while a nice mamma's boy man and he asks her to marry him she says yes i loved her mom's questions do you love him loretta no good if you love him he'll drive you crazy because they know they can but you like him then oh yeah he's a sweet man ma when johnny goes off to sicily to care for his dying mother he asks that loretta make contact with his brother who he's been estranged from for years br br this victory for human rights carries even greater significance as sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment in 1938 italian psychiatrist ugo cerletti saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs easing the job of slitting their throats cerletti was inspired and began experimenting with electroshock on humans developing the first electroshock machine broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern br br this was in so many ways an anti american movie it's about love to be sure but it's also about infidelity secrets lonely people and strange behavior brought on by american policies the characters from the frumpy bobo at the favorite restaurant the aunt and uncle her parents and their problems the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters it's somewhat of a chick flick as it's how loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp it's a cinderella story in many ways and that is every little girl's dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan br br assuming free and fully informed consent it is well to reaffirm the individual's right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses but we might ask ourselves whether we as fans of cinema though in no way sworn to any hippocratic oath should be offering it
<START> in one of neil simon's best plays creaky cranky ex vaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are teaming up for a tv comedy special the problem is they haven't even seen each other in over a decade full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes this story flies along with a steady stream of humor good work also by richard benjamin as the harried nephew rosetta lenoire as the nurse and howard hesseman as the tv commercial director steve allen and phyllis diller appear as themselves trivia note the opening montage contains footage from hollywood revue of 1929 and shows marie dressler bessie love polly moran cliff edwards charles king gus edwards and the singing brox sisters
<START> i really wanted to like this movie i absolutely love kenny hotz and spenny rice has a charming side to him not that i like spenny at all spenny ruins this movie he should of let kenny and his hot girlfriend pitch the movie br br anyways it's pretty boring aside from a scene with roger ebert in it there really isn't too many celebrities in this movie and most don't seem to say more than one line overall this movie was disappointing i would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season 1 dvd of kenny vs spenny it comes for free on the 3rd disc regardless of this production i am still very excited to check out the papel chase
<START> though derivative labyrinth still stands as the highlight of the mid half of the six year old show finally a story allows welling to show how he has grown as an actor it's not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of truth justice and the american way on a weekly basis with very little variation his performance permitting him to show how one might react if he she discovers that all that he knew may be a lie was quite believable br br welling rose to the occasion marvelously br br as always michael rosenbaum as the handicapped lex delivered as did kristen kreuk as a too sweet to be believed lana allison mack the ever present chloe also scored as a slightly off her rocker version br br the use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama
<START> i recently decided to revisit the omen trilogy only to discover that insert demonic music here there is a fourth i didn't expect much from it and in that respect it certainly lived up to my expectations if you're into watching bad movies for a laugh then this just may be the movie for you oh where do we start br br from the onset the made for tv look and feel of the movie was obvious the music was often inappropriately matched with what was happening in the movie and therefore at best distracting the script had all the suspense of an 8 year olds work of fiction but one thing that must be said is that the lacking script was very well matched up with the appalling acting numerous scenes left me contemplating whether it was the script or the acting that was the source of ridiculousness br br the story itself is quite thin centering on all the crazy antics of the daughter of damien thorn adopted out by wrong doing and badly acted nuns there is the usual lot of mysterious and convoluted deaths that personally made me yawn as the drama unfolded and the usual third party investigator into the whole affair later via some medical phenomena damien thorn jnr is born and that pretty much wraps up the plot the whole thing is executed rather badly right from the beginning with the lack of suspense making the movie one monotonous and or ridiculous scene after another br br there were many wtf moments too that provides the unintended comedy relief for example what's with the major over reaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby scratches the mother's cheek hardly a 360 degree head turning omen i also laughed at the over reaction at the baptism the baby cries and everyone looks very concerned the distressed mother runs out of the church and the priest is left looking very alarmed while crossing himself huh then there is the new age nanny that seems to have carte blanche on exposing an 8 year old to all kind of alternative spiritualism i laughed when the nanny suggested bringing the troubled delia to a psychic fair to meet the nanny's hippie friends and the mother just shrugs her shoulders and allows it yeah that's groovy fill my troubled 8 year old daughter's head with all this mysticism stuff that's cool i don't need to be there of course this would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt a fully grown rottweiler they encounter on the street that could bite the little girls head off as a snack the entire scene at the psychic fair is quite comical in a slapstick kinda way from the horrified reactionary stares of the psychics to delia to the ensuing inferno br br i also laughed at how the nun's death is considered a freak accident here we have a religious zealot who is described as being part of a cult who is fanatically preaching in a pit full of rattlesnakes to prove how god's glory will protect them she antagonizes the snakes by handling them and somehow she is bitten several times hardly a freak accident more like a successful suicide attempt br br the snakes vs nun scene wasn't the only comical death there is the slow speed car accident resulting in decapitation in a school parking lot then there is the slow motion demolition ball headed straight for the detective i believe i may have gone and made a coffee when the slow motion started only to come back to see the demolition ball still headed straight for the concerned detective then there is the quintessential who shot who clichÃ© death where a gun goes off and both act as if they have been shot for several seconds while exchanging horrified glances then someone goes tumbling down the stairs revealing who the real victim was additionally the death of the priest at the beginning of the movie seemed a little strange and pointless to me he runs around looking at the architecture of the church obviously finding this quite distressing he eventually collapses clutching his chest and dies apparently something demonic was happening as this is what the music was suggesting ummm ok br br i am surprised that others have reviewed this film favorably and in particularly as a worthy sequel it is difficult not to notice the non sensical script the unrealistic acting and the inappropriate musical score the movie lacks any suspense relying heavily on delia's demonic stare to provide a sense of horror which becomes rather annoying after a short time br br bottom line this is a bad movie with the only redeeming feature being it's unintended potential for being a comedy
<START> a pretty worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer insect script ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel i think it is from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant bed there is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either watching a bunch of ants sting their victims is not very terrifying br br spoilers section the stupidity of the hero is near incredible he is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero it has to be a mysterious virus after the inspector says this the hero takes his bulldozer and wrecks the huge ant colony this disturbs the millions of ants and traps the people in the hotel br br end spoilers overall this movie is extremely lame i don't understand why it got a dvd release when so many deserving movies have none my only guess for the dvd release is that suzanne summers is featured in the film this is a movie to avoid
<START> basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970's classic kitsch horror 'death line' which ironically was like this cobblers also partly filmed at the disused aldwych underground station br br making good use of the now disused jubilee line platforms at charing cross as well as the aforementioned aldwych this film contains basically the same plot dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train originality is not this film's strong point br br indeed strong points are sadly lacking the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub gollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot device br br franke polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film out acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats br br if creepy films set on the london underground are your bag or you just want to play 'spot the tube location' them pick this up on dvd when it hits a bargain bin if you are looking for classic horror go and dig up a copy of death line aka raw meat br br if you are looking for a quality well written and acted film you will need to change trains
<START> well in contrast to other comments previously written i have to say that the only good thing about this film is the fact that one guy in it looked a bit like jason donavon which reminded me of my youth i have no idea how it won any awards and although i'm sure a great deal of effort went into making it it was all fruitless as the final outcome is one which screams of early 90's foreign soap operas the plot was non existent the cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on par with an a level performance it was unfortunately long and the sub plots were incredibly unrealistic for example if your best friend slept with your ex boyfriend of 6 years after only 2 weeks of being broken up you would not all remain the best of friends it was all fantasy that's all oh yeah and the weird 90's house soft core indie was mind numbing
<START> buster keaton was finding his feature length voice in three ages there are some fine sequences but it doesn't quite hang together the chariot race in three ages is hilarious included are 2 shorts one of which the goat is excellent
<START> i like the cast pretty much however the story sort of unfolds rather slowly danny glover does a good job making you wonder if he's the bad guy meanwhile the other characters are just part of the story dennis quaid didn't have as much room in the story as he could have had i thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded i'd watch it again though i rated it a 5 wish i could rate it a 5 5
<START> this video contains an outsmart way to confuse and manipulate americans about islam it's a pity that the people who did it really believe that american people is so dumb to believe in it perhaps as an american citizen every person must protest against this kind of crap if you want to know the truth about islam don't let nobody tell you the quran is public you can read it by yourself and decide if what they say it's true or false br br the video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies directed to manipulate and associate things that are not even related the music used at some points prepare the public to hate what they see even if they don't really understand what's going on in there they use images that are misplaced from their original content br br to end the comment i would like to make a reflexion don't you think you can do the same exact movie with every religion in the world
<START> there are so many comments on this film yet i found them to be misleading this a corner cutting over used scenario where a normal human being becomes a partner in crime to someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason boy meets girl girl holds boy up at gunpoint for something ridiculous boy is intrigued br br you know the drill the antagonist turns out to be a wild free spirit instead of a sociopath toss in a few words of wisdom from alice drummond and you have a recipe for love sheedy's 'is she crazy or does she just need a hug ' role from the breakfast club simply reeks as a lead character and all that is left is a truly ghastly turkey of a movie
<START> this movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story i too cannot understand why people would trash this movie br br if you are a jerry bruckheimer fan this movie may not suitable for u br br this movie presents high degree of realism the actors and actresses' performance is examplary not fake just natural br br no special sound effects so special side effects br br the camera work is excellent the music is oh so good i can't wait to get the soundtrack br br it leaves your body numb like constant garderner the directly has raw talent certainly not a follower
<START> it's been 19 years since gordon gekko used wall street to let us know that greed is good now michael douglas takes the gg persona and morphs it into a secret service agent pete garrison guess what it works this is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing the detail work in showing the security precautions taken by the ss on behalf of the president and first lady was likewise intriguing all the leads were pretty good but try as i might i could not accept eva longoria as a secret service agent whereas jodie foster just made you suspend belief and really think she was fbi agent starling in silence of the lambs you do not get the same feeling with longoria nevertheless this is a fun film escapist entertainment with the beltway as the backdrop
<START> i enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter i had never heard of before so i set out exploring her life and work afterwards as could be expected i found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate i was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy come on guys a film isn't and shouldn't be a biography nor a novel any historical film distorts reality because it should be a work of art in its own right a film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own artemisia is a wonderful film and i think it brought many people including some that now give negative comments to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist
<START> this movie is very funny amitabh bachan and govinda are absolutely hilarious acting is good comedy is great they are up to their usual thing it would be good to see a sequel to this br br watch it good time pass movie
<START> handsome and dashing british airline pilot george taylor a solid portrayal by guiseppe pambieri gets beat up by thugs after a wild night in hong kong george meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal dr emy wong a fine and charming performance by the lovely chai lee george regains his health and goes back to work when emy fails to hear from george for a lengthy amount of time she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute while director co writer bitto albertini does indeed deliver a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and steamy soft core sex this film is anything but your routine wallow in leering sleaze instead it's a surprisingly thoughtful touching and tragic love story between two well drawn and highly appealing characters chai as emy wong is especially radiant and endearing the picture starts out bubbly and cheerful but the tone radically shifts into a more grim and harsh mood about two thirds of the way through emy's descent into vice after she falsely assumes that george has abandoned her is bleak and upsetting ditto the remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprise bummer ending granted the narrative is certainly melodramatic but never too silly or trashy moreover the sex scenes are quite tasteful and even genuinely erotic notorious italian porn star ilona staller has a nice sizable supporting part as george's jealous and uninhibited secretary helen miller guido mancori's polished cinematography offers many strikingly gorgeous shots of the exotic locations nico fidenco's funky throbbing score hits the groovy spot worth a look for those seeking something different
<START> the good thing about this film is that it stands alone you don't have to have seen the original unfortunately this is also it's biggest drawback it would have been nice to have included a few of the original characters in the new story and seen how their lives had developed sinclair as in the original is excellent and provides the films best comic moments as he attempts to deal with awkward and embarrassing situations but the supporting cast is not as strong as in the original movie forsyth is to be congratulated on a brave attempt to move the character on and create an original sequel but the film is ultimately flawed and lacks the warmth of the original
<START> i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie rocked it is pure cg over acted crap don't send an assassin it's much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored aggressive venomous snakes on a plane the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to it is not so bad it's good it's so bad i'd rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane a spoof was i wrong it's that whole it sucks get it or samuel a jackson yells snakes on the plane thing well i'm sorry i don't get it it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hung's cd still live in their mommies basement and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn then rush to the theater and ask for one since i doubt you have a girlfriend ticket for snakes on a stupid butt plane to hell with movies like full metal jacket pulp fiction true romance 12 monkeys clerks etc there's no irony in watching good movies the true decline of the western civilization calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man or even orgazmo i've said enough here
