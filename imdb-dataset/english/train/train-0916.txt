<START> yes i did as i sit here red faced remembering having felt almost guilty as i watched it a couple of weeks back while my wife chose to watch something as inconsequential in comparison as mommie dearest br br how does one explain the appeal of batman and robin i mean the only ones who ever really counted adam west and burt ward it was a terrible show with terrible plots and terrible acting and oh yes it was terribly funny and the same applies to this reunion and flashback movie adam and burt are invited to an auction where the old batmobile is going to be sold off for charity but it gets stolen and our pals as themselves jump into their old characters' personas if not their costumes and head off to find out what's happened along the way they reminisce about the series and we see how it all came together in flashbacks with jack brewer and jason marsden playing the young adam and burt of the tv series it really was quite interesting to get some behind the scenes looks at the old series and adam and burt just stepped perfectly back into character even though they weren't really in character well you'd have to watch it to see what i mean it was also great to see julie newmar and frank gorshin br br if you're not a fan of the old series you'll hate this if heaven forbid you actually thought michael keaton and george clooney made acceptable batmans then you'll hate this even more but if you grew up with adam and burt and are still willing to admit that you never missed an episode well this one's for you br br yes it's true 9 10
<START> i rated this a ten just because i find it so impressive what a single eighteen year old can do with a video camera it's no epic but it's plenty engaging and i was never bored if tens of millions of dollars can go into the countless bad films that are poured out en masse then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens i know i'll be lining up at the local cinema for her first major release damn good job and well worth the money what a script it might be low budget but it beats the hell out of half the major pictures i've seen lately nanavati knows how to tell a story both in writing and on screen serious kudos to her can't wait to see more
<START> payback is the game being played in this drama and the revenge plot is undone by the absurd story line that sets the stage for the fireworks that come later why would a man become involved with the trophy wife of a ruthless mob boss in the gangster's own mansion with suspicious henchmen all around why would an unhappy wife encourage the attentions of a complete stranger and expect him to carry her away with him and leave her husband and boredom behind to live happily ever after with her new love surely the hero here kevin costner must have expected a reaction from the cuckold husband that gives the movie an excuse to indulge in senseless gore and violence anthony quinn great actor that he was surely deserved better and madeleine stowe is the tragic figure who suffers greatly as she latches on to her prince charming stowe is okay but her spanish accent doesn't work the cameos of the lesser players are good especially miguel ferrer and john leguizamo and sally kirkland is interesting as a fading rock star
<START> violence whether real or not always has an impact in this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for in the great ecstacy the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of but what was the point the violence looks like a mix of noÃ«'s 'irreversible and ' kubrick's 'clockwork orange' both of which are remarkable films don't get me wrong i'm not opposed to screen violence at all and i've seen some nasty stuff in my film going years but this film as a whole is totally juvenile the story is never developed enough to offer any reason for the extreme violence the rizla paper thin reason we are give for robert's demise is his introduction to drugs danny dyer plays the character who is partly responsible for robert's drug fuelled demise however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes lesley manville is robert's unable to cope mum i am not sure what either of these actors is doing in a film of this low caliber the acting is wooden the scene in the kitchen with the tv cook and his wife for instance is as painful to watch if not more so than the shocking finale who wrote those dialogues some of the comments the boys make 'looks like she's enjoying it' are so trite as to tempt one to laugh if it were not for clay's ardent desire to bombard us with harrowing images of mutilated female genitals why we need to be shown such detail possibly down to the director's adolescent obsession with sadistic pornographic imagery one can only wonder at this young man's psychology br br the 'political meaning' of the film was repeatedly brought to our attention due to the amount of scenes in the bar outside the tv cook's house war in iraq reports was perhaps too obvious in my opinion yes war is violent social determinism causes frustration we're all prone to horrifingly violent acts whether you're in politics or on the street popping e juxtaposing all these things as part of the same underlying issue is evading the actual issue which is the meaning of violence in man this issue is one that we still haven't managed to grasp and certainly not in this film br br my opinion derivative badly made and pointless
<START> okay i've tried and i've tried but i still don't get this guy maddin thing tales from the gimli hospital left me cold that movie about the austrian villagers and the one about the ice nymph were pretty to look but lacking in the story department and this nudie movie about abortion and hockey is just boring i'm glad maddin has an appreciation for silent film but i dislike his films for the same reason i dislike the films of quentin tarantino they're empty homages to better more imaginative films films that advanced the art form or broke new ground and are all style and no substance no amount of jump cuts and odd camera angles can disguise the fact that maddin is an unoriginal david lynch wannabe though he does have one advantage over tarantino he generally doesn't write embarrassing dialogue because most of his films rely on intertitles the bottom line is maddin's schtick is clever clever film making for aspiring film majors
<START> i saw this film first in the soviet union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee but then in poland in 2000 i watched it in a complete form and so what the plot is incredibly unwise 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong straight and fundamentally severe ladies the men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichÃ©s follow sex drive constant masculine desire for sex feminists who are shown like complete idiots you may agree with them or not but idiots certainly they are not and so on the performance even of the stellar jerzy stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like i am in the elevator with a nude chick and i haven't done anything to her this was intended to be a comedy instead it turned out to be a vapid farce full of predictable jokes and below the waist innuendos do not waste your time on it this is just bad
<START> i just saw this movie on a local tv station tv8's big chuck and little john in cleveland ohio i had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it br br i know of no thesaurus that can even come close to aiding me in describing how bad this movie really is the script is awful the acting well other than one of two exceptions is pointless since there is nothing in this material that merits any real effort br br it looks like a bunch of little ideas leftover from various writing sessions that where thrown into a blender it's not just funny the parody aspect is strained at best some references where almost out of date even for the time of it's release no wonder i had never heard of it it's really bad worse than anything saturday night live mad tv or even in living color put out in their worst days br br if you see it on tv it is a great example of how not to make a movie whatever you do don't waste a cent br br adam
<START> this program didn't do it for me although i'm a fan of the genre the major factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene which was not dominated by the main character this made it a bit two dimensional and i gave up before the program was over br br i was hoping to leave my critique there as i'm no movie critic however the guidelines on imdb state that you must put in 10 lines of commentary it did remind me of hudson hawk in the way the main character is in every single scene and i would hope that the writers of this program could employ some more diversity to engage with the viewers i don't doubt the talent of any of the cast and crew it's just that after watching things like the wire i've come to expect great things from cop drama
<START> this one stood out for it's originality i'm seriously tired of seeing hindi movies that are a hotch potch of a whole bunch of hollywood and brit movies some flaws were inevitable nonetheless this movie is a must see surya's portrayal of the clean cut conscientious cop as opposed to the pot bellied money hungry ones that we normally see was awesome he's come a long way from his work in nerukku ner i liked the movie so much that i had to own it i'm not usually into the mindless violence type of movies somehow i actually felt for each character and therefore can't really bring myself to call it 'mindless' violence i do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most hindi and tamil movies i absolutely loved this movie for it's lack of the same acp anbuselvan's reaction to loosing his wife is not overdone is heart wrenching and makes me want to bawl my eyes out there are certain times when i'm watching a movie when i want to hit the ff button plenty of times i've wanted to do that at a cinema hall never wanted to do so when watching this movie i'm really hoping that ghajini releases soon
<START> not sure if this counts as a spoiler or not so beware br br just a small but crucial thing to watch for an intriguing possibility the boys steal a green citroen at one point for a joy ride and return it to the owner having done purposeful and vengeful hidden damage to the car hoping that the owner will crash is it the very same car they steal much later from the picnicking family we know the original owner sold it they drive off at the end on a dangerous road one which i understand has been closed to all but pedestrians for the last ten years a whole new slant to the end of the film br br on another matter this film could have been called scent of a woman i don't recall another film certainly not american that treats the scent of a woman in such a frank and open manner much like the nose of a fine bordeaux
<START> though this may not necessarily be a so called classic film by today's standards it's still worth seeing the main reason why is because after experiencing this film you get the feeling that you've also experienced the counter cultural idealism of the 60's no matter however good or bad br br i happened to see this film in an english literature class at suny geneseo and though at first it appears to be just a meaningless composition of 60's icons the film is far from being simply thrown together br br my point is that if you leave the film feeling unsatisfied and confused the film has done it's job it's conveyed a desolate view of the future that leaves you feeling unsure and angry it was perhaps this same feeling that the film sought to explore in the youth it exemplified br br as such zabriskie point may not tell a very good or interesting story and at the same time its characters may be one sided and predictable however it also conveys so well this sort of clichÃ©d rebellious desire to get out of the existence which both mark and daria must share even the anti establishment students are as inauthentic as the gov't they rebel against
<START> but if you like the muppets i defy you to dislike this one basically the same plot regurgitated this time new york not la it features a lot of fun cameos and muppet hi jinx a lot of the muppets leave the film pretty early on as it centers around kermy and miss piggy i happened to have enjoyed it greatly fun to watch with your kids
<START> i never thought i see a movie worse than lisa picard is famous but this came pretty close as repeated often throughout the comments it was predictable five minutes into the movie you know it will be a stranded at the alter outcome this movie painfully references rips off everything from something about mary to revenge of the pink panther writer greg glienna meet the parents needs some new material br br the only twist is the deranged boyfriend police officer pursued by internal affairs but even that opportunity is wasted lots of setting shots of the seattle space needle necessary to disguise the obvious canadian shooting locale some of the worst driving in the car scenes with almost no effort to disguise the fact that the car is being pulled through town on a trailer geez at least turn the wheel or put the brakes on once in a while selma blair is inert and the short haircut a crime 3m to jason lee for what guess it beats skateboarding br br so here's who should see this movie bee gees fans who want to hear two actors sing 'islands in the stream' badly people who can't get enough of julia stiles 1 10
<START> life hits us in the face we must try to stay beautiful br br debut movie from one of belgian's best artists he sings songs tom barman a long awaited movie and happy happy joy joy for flemish filmmaking really worth watching and a promising piece of work it takes us into the lifes of 8 main characters that live through a friday and night the title says a lot about the way we spend time with them we float as they do into friday night's party where they kinda' meet br br it's rhytmic style is very 'thought off' superb use of music it sometimes takes the upperhand to the images and then you feel its power gainsbourg qotsa the party scene 20minutes is a thrilling visual experience cause of the way that it's shot it keeps you really with it while it's set in a small place with a lot of people having a big party so hard to shoot br br thank you menijÃ¨r barman for making this daring movie in these already some years going poor times of flemish filmmaking you made my day
<START> well i had seen they all laughed when it came out in br br europe around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it i 've just seen it again on tape almost twenty years after bogdanovich has a true heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not to feel also excellent comedians and actors good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing too i laughed and smiled all the time just as we all do at times go get it
<START> unentertaining uninvolving hybrid of cruel intentions and wild things but it isn't nearly as good as either of those trash min classics it's about the acting sheriff artie taye diggs being called in to investigate a near fatal drug overdose at a posh upper class univesity but to keep it on the down low as he digs deeper he thinks it's much more than it at first glance seems to be we follow alicia the girl who overdosed in flashbacks as well at about 90 minutes if this film was welcomed to begin with it would have worn it out this film brings absolutely nothing new to the table but it is the only movie thus far that has miss swain topless so the grade is higher just for that br br my grade d br br eye candy dominique swain gets topless fixing a mistake of happy campers another girl is topless br br anti eye candy more men ass than girl tit
<START> this movie is the biggest steaming pile of you know what being from and growing up in wichita kansas i know for a fact 90 of the movie was bogus aside from the names of some of the victims nothing else much was correct the movie looks like it was made with dad's handy cam it had footage that i believe came from another film along with stock footage from a slaughter house i usually enjoy watching bad films for the fun of it but due to the bad acting poorly prepared or non existent sets and a very dull and short ending it was a struggle to watch it through to the ending i recommend that you not waste your money on this film or you will be sorry crunch
<START> i happened upon this movie as an 8 10 year old on a cold dark november afternoon i was outside playing all day freezing and when i came in around 4pm i had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of the tv with a blanket i was surprised to be watching a cartoon that wasn't all happy and silly and was in fact dark and moralistic it captured my imagination i'm sure it misses the text and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the tolkien purist but it still captures the spirit of the story the choice to carry a burden for the good of others the consequences of selfish rash decisions etc the quality of animation leaves room for complaint but the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterizations john hurt is great in this if you don't like how the character is drawn look away and just listen to him his voice is extraordinary i've seen it again many many times and it always brings me back to that time as a kid thirsty for some magical adventure it's for this reason i say 'lucky' the film is nostalgic for me so i overlook its shortcomings but between john hurt and tolkien's fantasy it still reached me and still does
<START> going into see seven pounds i wasn't clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about so within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot have no idea what is going on and you think tim who claims to be ben is just a big asshole all of this comes to an end when the twist so to speak is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie basically tim will smith was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives by this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to br br the acting of this film is great as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress rosario dawson to me this is one of her better movies aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to she has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film other actors such as woody harrelson have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character although the casting of the film was still good br br this movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped the movie however was still pretty good nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything falls into place up until then it just seems like a pointless love story final thought seven pounds seven stars
<START> the genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one the big problem is implausability i realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next but this movie was so predictable and is just not believable i find that the more i watch this kind of movie the more i am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid if they took the time to make it more realistic i might have enjoyed it a little having said that you might be better off staying away from this one
