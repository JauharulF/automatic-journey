<START> a frolics of youth short subject br br a teenager embarrassed by his fear of dogs runs away from home the abandoned spaniel he finds helps to change his mind br br pardon my pups is an enjoyable little film with shirley temple stealing all her scenes as the hero's lively kid sister the opening gag dealing with bedwetting is in poor taste but is quickly forgotten highlight the climactic fisticuffs which look impressively realistic br br often overlooked or neglected today the one and two reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents both in front behind the camera the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel economical to produce in terms of both budget schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material short subjects were the perfect complement to the studios' feature films
<START> the saucy misadventures of four au pairs who arrive in london on the same day in the early 1970s there's a swedish girl a danish a german and a chinese the story contrives to get the clothes off all of them involve them in some carry on type humour and couple them with various misfits from the british film and tv culture of the time including man about the house star richard o'sullivan future coronation street rogue johnny briggs and horror film stalwart ferdy mayne playing a sheik there's a pretty risquÃ© amount of female nudity on display for those who like that kind of thing but obviously nothing hardcore br br most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential the girls are stereotypes and german anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder she's a moron obsessed with colour tv who acts like a kind of uninhibited child dresses to deliberately show her private parts in another more serious film she would be a psychiatric case the most interesting section of the film involves the swedish girl being taken to a club in london where some dodgy types are still trying to swing being seduced by a middle aged rocker losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her these sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we've ended up with in which promiscuity and the dregs of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives there's a fine turn by john standing as an impotent public school rouÃ© the strangest of the stories has the chinese girl future cannibal film veteran me me lay getting off with her childish piano prodigy employer falling mutually in love with and then leaving in the middle of the night for no good reason at all except some orientalist notion that chinese birds are inscrutable ain't they the film is pretty demeaning to its women characters and there's a smattering of homophobia in the dialogue and one of the characterisations the end is striking as mayne's sheik for no earthly reason except they have to end the film somehow whisks all of the girls away to his arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade which they are all delighted about br br stuff and nonsense for the most part then but directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran val guest which puts it as a piece of film making a notch above most of the 70s brit sexploitation flicks
<START> kudos to the writers of this film for creating a supremely engaging drama the curious character development is indicative of a nuanced and well schooled writing team the audience member cannot but help but to feel that s he must make wrenching emotional decisions pitting the cerebral against the libidinal the viewer has an opportunity to develop the character herself though her predictions are rarely validated br br credit is also due to the filmmakers for breathing life into the setting the wood shop is transformed into a unique persona as the film unfolds with its own traits faults a variety of highly charged relationships and of course a fate inexorably tied to that of the other principals br br make sure to catch this one at your local art house
<START> whoopi was the only reason i watched the oscars that year she is hilarious of course there was a major serious side to the show she was great not only because she's funny but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum white folks need to be reminded that hollywood awards' ceremonies employment and representation are way out of balance racially there should be no need for black awards shows the white bread milquetoast nominators and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to white directors producers actors etc allowing woody allen on the air was the depth of poor taste he had no business being there the fact of the matter is this is the first oscar presentation i've watched since the color purple was up for awards that miscarriage of voting soured me on watching the shows until 2002 which is not to denigrate other presenters billy crystal is a riot
<START> the nearest i ever came to seeing this was a clip shown at a gerard philippe exposition in paris about two years ago i had no interest in the remake and having just caught up with the original just over half a century after it was made i can only conclude that the inept fencing was intentional aimed at a long obsolete target hollywood had been doing realistic sword fights since the 30s when the greatest of them all basil rathbone crossed foils with errol flynn and others so the technique was available and so that leaves only satire after a while you don't notice and revel in the henri jeanson dialogue reminiscent of the prisoner of zenda both versions gerard philippe certainly had the presence to bring off a role like this and gina lollabrigida was probably a tad better than martine carol the other obvious candidate at the time the print i saw was particularly bad and at one point broke down completely so maybe a dvd version would enhance it
<START> i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments it's not a bad movie exactly but it's one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre plus it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways and the characters' behavior often strains belief i'd say its a film that you would get something out of if you don't have a lot of film tv literature life behind you to be honest i've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even otherwise its point has been made before and more artfully and that gets to the big problem which is that it really doesn't have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling and it doesn't really pay off
<START> return to the 3th chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic 36th chamber of shaolin in which gordon liu played shan te a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter in this sequel liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after causing his friends to be beaten he imitates the original shan te tries all manner of tricks to get into shaolin temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses its a classic light hearted martial arts tale with the ace production values of the shaw brothers and the sure footed direction of lui chia liang the choreography is fantastic throughout whether for fighting or slapstick comedy and gordon liu's performance as are the others particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material the film is less epic or profound than some of the stars other work and there are certainly grander more violent and sweeping shaw brothers films but few have such a magical blend of slapstick unique training and fighting with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy making good full of light hearted joy its impossible not to give this the highest score
<START> scott henderson the engineer that employs carol richman as his assistant makes a point to call her kansas whenever he speaks to her it shows us that carol effectively played by ella raines is supposed to be a babe in the woods as far as the manhattan of the 40s was concerned only a woman from out of town would follow the shady bartender to a solitary elevated subway even then only a naive girl could undertake such an adventure br br robert siodmak directed this film noir very well he shows a flair for infusing the story with a lot of raw sex that was surprising for those days how else could we justify the way the drummer in the orchestra of the musical where scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat makes such an overt pass at a lady on a date the drummer played with high voltage by elisha cook jr doesn't hide his desires for any of the ladies who sat in the front row of the hit musical where he plays it was a real explicit invitation first to the phantom woman of the story fay helm afterward cliff the drummer insinuates himself very openly to ella raines who goes to the theater disguised as the mystery dame her boss had taken originally br br this is a film that will hook any viewer from the beginning there are things not explained in it but it holds the one's interest throughout the killer is not revealed until the end br br ella raines with her expressive eyes was an under estimated actress she holds her own against much more experienced actors franchot tone a new york stage actor working in hollywood never found in this medium the fame he deserved he is effective as the accused man's best friend on the other hand alan curtis comes across as a man who when framed accepts his fate and is saved only by the tenacity of the woman who secretly loved him thomas gomez as the inspector burgess is an asset to the film as a detective who has his doubts the police had caught the man who committed the crime br br this movie will not disappoint
<START> extremely poor action film starring the ever wooden dolph lundgren and brandon lee trapped in a sidekick role that never seems to gel the action is at best average a bit of nudity chucked in and yes tia carrera does use a body double br br the set up is the usual renegade cop forced to break in a new partner on a big case the makers at least try to give the formula a twist making lundgren the cop with oriental values and lee the modern city slicker but there is zero character development making it almost comical lundgrens oriental warrior outfit for the big showdown has to be seen to be believed the action sequences are by the numbers and lee who would go on to make the excellent the crow is never given the scope to show off any particular martial arts brilliance but given his illustrious parentage he must have been under a hell of a lot of pressure and was far better served not having to live up to his father by taking on a very different role in the crow which showed what a unique actor he may have become if not for his tragic and early death br br unless your a hardcore lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80's style action movies think cobra etc then avoid br br poor 3 10
<START> movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining so can whoopi goldberg movies but whoopi and dinosaurs br br after the first 20 minutes of theodore rex i had come to one conclusion this movie is evil evil vile wicked and reprehensible in its spite for the audience nothing this bad is made by accident this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber br br first of all whoopi does not make good action movies watch fatal beauty if you think i'm lying but the film makers don't care she's a tough cop here yet again br br seen a million cop buddy flicks this week well here's number one million and one pal br br don't like cute humanistic animated dinosaurs since that spielberg tv show about them too bad here's another one and he's a cop too br br you one of those people that hates car chases shoot outs sloppy dialogue boring futuristic fx and seeing talented people goldberg mueller stahl roundtree stuck in a movie that looks like a tax write off a big tax write off br br and you read this review all the way to the end you deserve a sequel seriously br br no stars not a one and if they really make a sequel to theodore rex hollywood deserves to be attacked a whole herd of wise cracking foam rubber dinosaurs br br now i'd pay to see that
<START> it really was that bad on a par with the mercifully short lived dirty dozen tv series that starred ben murphy and was made at around the same time also on the cheap in yugoslavia br br i was embarrassed for the cast members of this film and for telly savalas in particular he was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role pushing 70 when he made this garbage and the reviewer who draws parallels with telly the greek in this and john wayne in the green berets pretty much sums it up br br other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable howlers that this crime against celluloid contains so i won't repeat them here but i will add that i'm amazed that no one's yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny looking helmet that savalas wears on his big bloated head br br i'm also astonished that this trainwreck of a film has a rating as high as 4 7 here at imdb br br as far as i'm concerned it's a 1 right across the board if you want a good example of why flogging a franchise to death really is a bad idea especially 20 plus years after the original look no further than the dirty dozen the fatal mission br br awful avoid
<START> first let me say i am not from the south but i am an american i don't love country music but i can stomach it i would never wear a cowboy hat but i wear hats i don't live in a trailer but i do eat tuna salad and own a home what does that have to do with this comment a lot if you are one of those people who say only country people love this movie this movie is loosely based on the they loved and lost premise james bridges directs an american love story as real as it gets in an era of jerry springer and lets put it out there mentality this film rings truer than ever br br bud is coming of age and embarks on a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle so he moves to the big city with them bud finds himself drawn into the local honky tonk world for the only escape a blue collar man can afford he quickly meets sissy who is from a similar background and the two have a whirlwind romance filled with painful ups and downs br br this plot takes so many turns that one has to just sit for a few minutes before they get hooked marriage is a focus here that is often missed early in the film they marry and we view the transition from being single to married the film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old fashioned man it also brings into view the male ego with women and competition br br bud is challenged and is excited when micky's puts in an electronic bull sissy gets ideas of having fun on it too but is quickly reminded that she is married and need to start acting like it the emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the plot continues from there especially when they note this is giving some of the storyline away split and sissy falls for an ex con with a penchant for abuse and cruelty she soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side br br how anyone can compare bud to vinnie barbirino is shocking to me john travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy recognition he was believable and real the scene where he shaves his beard and you first see him at the bar still gives me goosebumps mind you i am not a huge travolta fan but come on i see why sissy was kicking of her boots so early in the film deb winger was so real that you found yourself sympathizing with her as she pens a note of emotions to bud after sneaking in to clean his house during their break up br br the supporting cast was incredible wes played by scott glenn gave a first rate performance that made you hate him and curse him as he abused sissy madolyn smith osborne as buds mistress girlfriend was so authentic that large chested girls across the u s prayed to wake up flat chested to wear the clothes she donned in the film my biggest kudos's go to barry corbin and brooke anderson as bud's aunt and uncle they seemed like someone's aunt and uncle somewhere in texas and however small their role they made the film so much bigger and lifelike two memorable scenes were the dolly parton contest and the unforgettable scene where bud and his aunt stand outside after one of the characters death the dialog between them is touching br br if you can watch this for what it is a true american love story then i recommend that you take it for what it is a film before it's time that gave us voyeurism into a world unlike our own but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment if this world sounds similar to yours then you will enjoy it so much more lastly the music however dated is sure to send you back in time if you are over 30 years of age
<START> bob clampett's 'an itch in time' milks seven minutes of crazy action out of a very small premise elmer fudd tells his dog that if he scratches himself just once more that he will be given a dreaded bath unfortunately for the dog a relentless flea makes it all but impossible to stop from scratching the cartoon switches between the flea's progress inside the dog's fur and the dog's desperate attempts to cope with it in a great sequence that really captures the frustration of an itch that can't be scratched the dog changes colour from brown to blue to red to polka dotted to plaid it sounds ludicrously surreal but it perfectly evokes the indescribable feeling of an itch in a way only clampett could there are several other elements which make 'an itch in time' pure clampett there's the grotesque concept itself which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea munching on the dog's flesh there's the unrestrained violence that rears its head in any scene featuring the cat most notably there's the dirty jokes including a huge shot of the dog's behind which causes the flea to wolf whistle and a hysterical sequence in which the dog attempts to scratch himself by dragging his backside along the floor he momentarily breaks off to address the audience hey i better cut this out i may get to like it with a very limited concept clampett manages to make 'an itch in time' a unique minutiae based cartoon like an early episode of 'seinfeld' 'an itch in time' is practically about nothing but very funny with it
<START> i look around in the video store still in shock how steven seagal with his track record of bad action movies can still have 3 movies hit the shelves in less than a year attack force being the 3rd no less promised the first time entrance into the sci fi genre for our ever widening seagal visions of bad movie entertainment flashed before my gullible eyes sadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come br br seagal rebounded a tiny bit with the trashy but enjoyable shadow man last time we saw him however attack force has to be his absolute worst movie ever don't argue for out for a kill ticker or even black dawn folks this is the bottom of the septic tank here br br anyone who says this is steven seagal's return to form should be forced to write a 100 page essay on the word taste br br seagal is yet another agent i'm a supreme bad ass yet again named lawson wants revenge for the killing of his team that leads him to a nefarious plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public not to mention the dealers are not from around here br br the whole production from directing to the acting is poor was this movie shot in the dark its gotta be the most poorly lighted movie since howling 2 the action is terrible and very badly done br br the producers have also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the most throw in stunt double after stunt double and horribly dubbed steven seagal who seems to show little enthusiasm here can ya blame him br br while it has been said that attack force was not the movie stevie signed on for originally harvester and surely has to be better than attack force the post production tampering has not made it more coherent and made seagal look worse i feel bad for directer michael keusch and writer joe halpin as they are gonna be judged forever for the ill advised production re shoots br br so now this leaves seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to atone for this mess but after seeing how bad attack force has turned out do we really want him to make another movie
<START> fire and ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world the film is about a village that is destroyed by a giant glacier which is the home of the evil ice lord named nekron the only survivor of the village is a young man named larn who sets out to avenge those who were killed by the glacier the ice glacier moves through the land of fire and the princess of the land named teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures larn sets out to find her and also sets out to find and kill nekron fire and ice is directed by ralph bakshi who is one of my favourite adult animators he has brought us such animated masterpieces as the film version of fritz the cat and some films he has written himself like the great film heavy traffic i didn't like fire and ice nearly as much as i have ralph bakshi's other work but i still found the film to be enjoyable it had some very nice animation in parts and the story was entertaining enough the only basic complaints i have is that i wish that there was more of a story to the film because the story it uses is very thin and there is not a lot to it i also wish the film was a bit longer because it is under 80 minutes in running time still it's an entertaining action adventure films that unlike fritz the cat or heavy traffic is appropriate for kids 8 and older i only wish that there was a more developed story and it went on a bit longer than it did
<START> some people have stated that as of the 11th season south park has started a trend of leaving behind their politically biting satire for shallow spoofs but this could not be further from the truth br br while this episode does spoof the living dead series there is more it is a satire of how people treat the homeless characters say things like they're pretending to be just like us or they want to be human this episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the lower class who are often just down on their luck br br so yes it is still a satire and also a wonderful spoof what more could you want
<START> nothing revolutionary here just impeccably elegant restrained cinema br br garde a vue is confined almost exclusively to a drab police station and mostly to one interrogation room but director claude miller who made the wonderful film this sweet sickness among others intercalates spare glimpses of exterior tableaux as minimalist locale scenography miller's restraint especially early on is breathtaking and his exquisite handling of the consequently pivotal interior mise en scene makes for captivating viewing br br lino ventura is superb as usual succeeding to legitimize a character that on paper is cliche the laconic hard nosed world weary homicide detective ventura lives the role making it completely believable even though the script allows us little access to his inner workings the film ends at the very moment it appears he will be forced to confront his failure for the first time br br michel serrault is equal to the task as the suspected child killer who shrewdly spars with the single minded flic the exchanges between the two are more often than not pregnant with tension and the aura of a constantly metamorphosing playing field for a battle of wits serrault's character is by turns deplorably haughty and cunning and pitiable then later br br the message of garde a vue if one were to search for one is a condemnation of police methodology and the kind of pressures that make a cop over zealous to if necessary close cases at the expense of justice for most of its length though the film shines as nothing more than an exemplar of how to turn a potentially soporific set bound scenario into a suspenseful drama of the utmost cinematic economy br br
<START> what's the point of reviewing a movie like this it's painfully and embarrassingly bad not even in a way that allows you to make fun of it br br movies like little man depress me they represent film at its most disposable this movie was made for a bunch of 18 24 year old dipsh t frat boys who the studio was hoping would come out and see it on opening night before word leaked out about how bad it was so that the film could quickly recoup its investment br br a hundred other filmmakers with great ideas probably couldn't get their films made because resources were going toward making this puddle of vomit br br grade f
<START> i just saw this movie and i have to say that it was a big waste of time the girl who played eva ellen fjaestad can't act at all she read her lines very un naturally and she had a very un natural facial expression through the entire movie rosanna munter who played petra on the other hand is a natural she played her part with great perfection br br spoilers the story was simple we've seen it many many times before she breaks up he finds another she get jealous he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end there were no surprises at all one knew that eva would break up and that adam would hook up with petra the only thing that nobody saw coming was that petra told adam to go after eva at the party she became all serious which is a side of petra the viewers hadn't seen earlier in the movie and told him to win eva's heart back which was really cute br br besides rosanna munter there isn't a single actor who gives a memorable performance br br this is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors so i don't recommend it
<START> 1st watched 4 29 2007 4 out of 10 dir mick garris campy vampire like stephen king movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3 4 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for king fans it's the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers a shape shifting feline like flesh eating life needing near extinct breed of humanoid who move from town to town searching for virgins to feed on to keep themselves alive they come across as pretty normal upper class folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home day and night cats are deadly to them so they set traps in their yard to try and keep the population down we get to see them break a couple of their necks when they attack which is also a first in my movie going experience hopefully no real cats were harmed in the making of the film the boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush on until he turns into a sleepwalker and then he just wants her body there is so much campy uniqueness to this movie that it might have been better if it was an all out satirical comedy on suburban life but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minutes until you wish he'd just get over it and bring out the gore eventually that happens and the movie winds down to it's typical stephen king downbeat ending the movie is interesting because king's humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection but as a worthwhile movie experience it really doesn't cut it
