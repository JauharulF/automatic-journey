<START> i was never quite sure where this thing was going these people seem interested in what is going on on some mountain they investigate have narrow escapes leave come back leave put each other in danger sleepwalk get attacked by witches who have consistent wardrobes etc etc the guy seems to like the girl but leaves her unprotected numerous times she gets taken off he gets her back leaves her again you get the point the whole thing seems to get around to some sort of sacrifice i think but i'm not sure or turning people into witches but i'm not sure it's just dull and endless and not worth the time there are some atmospheric scenes but the print is so bad that there times when twenty seconds of blackness is not unusual is this caused by age or the overuse of night filters
<START> i had intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of marcello mastroianni's passing with numerous unwatched films of his that i own on vhs however given my ongoing light hearted christmas marathon i had to make do with just this one as it happens it features one of his best performances and he was justly oscar nominated for it with the film itself being likewise honored this was also one of 14 collaborations with that other most widely recognized star to emerge from italy sophia loren both incidentally are playing against type here she as an unglamorous housewife and he a homosexual br br by the way the film's title has a double meaning the leading characters are brought together on the historic day in which hitler came to italy to meet mussolini the event itself being shown in lengthy archive footage but it more specifically refers to the stars' 'brief encounter' in which they share moments of friendship revelation and briefly passion though each knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable which leads to the film's abrupt bittersweet ending this is virtually a two hander with all other characters save for the nosy concierge of the apartment block in which the story takes place in its entirety which include loren's gruff and fervently patriotic husband surprisingly played by john vernon appear only at the beginning and closing sequences still the cramped setting doesn't deter director scola for the record this is the 7th film of his that i've watched and own 3 more on vhs and cinematographer pasqualino de santis so that the result though essentially low key is far from stagy the camera is allowed to prowl the various sections of the large building observing the proceedings intimately or dispassionately as the situation requires but always keenly br br the narrative of course depends entirely on the performances of the two stars for it to be convincing and they both deliver their on screen chemistry is quite incomparable it's interesting however that while loren walked away with the prizes in their home turf it's mastroianni's moving yet unsentimental outsider the film somewhat dubiously does seem to equate his sexual deviance with anti fascism who generally impressed international audiences
<START> following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use the supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a contextual counterpoint to sarah's erratic persona which beyond general insensitivity has no specific recurring traits for behavioural expectations to be based on making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in every episode if not scene sarah's ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed every time she speaks it's like a self contained 5 second skit she overemotes a lot demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied this may be the most creative original and experimental tv program ever
<START> ella was excellent franchot was unavoidably over the top but he played similar parts in other films such as the man on the eiffel tower and alan was nearly non existent but the film certainly thrilled br br mild spoiler ahead i wonder how many times elisha cook got strangled in his films but i seem to recall various other examples i will avoid naming the murderer but i think it's necessarily obvious because of the plot thriller demands br br a very well done but dated film noire for example everyone smoked like crazy and the police were really stock characters and no dead bodies were ever shown unlike today's gore fests done in the familiar short scene tableaux format of the period br br 8 out of 10
<START> for some strange reason the film world is driven by fashion someone makes a film about a killer shark then all of a sudden the film world s oceans are awash with giant squids killer octopusses and sea monsters of every ilk a man is stalked by an erstwhile lover from hell then every film character is stalked by a cop from hell or a flatmate from hell or a babysitter from hell then when a major hollywood company produces a big budget fx laden blockbuster about tornados then other film producers jump upon the bandwagon the fact that they don t have the budget to pull it off doesn t stop them night of the twisters is a case in point what struck me about this made for television film is the fact that it tries to hide its lack of budget by cutting to the ad breaks everytime a tornado appears the camara locks onto the horrified expression of the actors as they scream things like oh my gawd it s heading this way and run for your lives then the screen fades to black saving the producers the need to up the special effects budget unfortunately night of the twisters budget should have been upped to include better actors the cast are by no means bad but they are unimpressive and lack the skill to carry a film which is character driven where s josh hartnett and elijah wood when you need them br br and the last word on this being a twister clone yes nott was released a couple of months before twister but twister had been hyped for several months as being the summer blockbuster of 1996 and nott has a rushed feeling to it which leads me to believe that it was made and released to tie in with the hype surrounding twister
<START> um okay i guess i get the whole shaky cam gorilla style filming technique but unfortunately i think a gorilla could have made a better movie this thing was just a complete mess from the get go bad acting bad directing bad story and horrific cinematography how this piece of garbage was released i will never know but it has and unfortunately i watched it filmed on location in tennessee by the directing team of greg swinson and ryan thiessen harry and lloyd five across the eyes i'm assuming is supposed to resemble a blair witch type film but falls short okay it nose dives off a cliff i was actually embarrassed for these young women whom i'm sure were promised hollywood stardom but ended up in this dung heap the dialog is ridiculous and actually aggravates you as you listen to it how this is supposed to be a horror flick is another mystery as there is nothing even remotely scary about it except for the fact that i watched it try this one on for size there is 5 of you and 1 of her do the math and beat her ass the end saddly it went on and on for 95 more minutes of mind numbing stupidity br br i saw it for free and wanted my money back
<START> this film is a flagrant rip off of one of the best novels of all time silas marner by george eliot br br the details of the film shown on imdb do give acknowledgement to the original authoress but i did not see this at the beginning of the film only a credit at the end of it saying suggested by the book silas marner suggested it was nothing but a complete rip off of all the essential elements of the story br br a wronged and sad old man an artisan poor and lonely has all his money stolen one night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside the man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire or rich politician here demands to adopt the child it is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before the battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child br br in this and every other aspect of the film the story is exactly the same in only one can i find a difference silas marner had epilepsy but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of mr martin too far on top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction presumably to make him look younger but actually making him look more the clown that he is there is also the addition of meaningless jokes that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years this is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful br br i am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made if i was a trustee of george eliot's i would insist on reparation if i was steve martin i would send the profits to that estate or to the poor at the very least it should be entitled silas marner adapted by s martin or better still removed from the archives br br if you are interested in this story and i hope you are dismiss this completely and watch silas marner or read the book the bbc made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980's
<START> first of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book especially when you're dealing with master writer like tolkien this adaptation wonderfully synthesizes tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia aesthetics and liberal culture yes the animation and background painting is sometimes a little rough in its technical execution but it's beautiful none the less and very evocative in terms of giving a unique sense of place to each of the scenes beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting acting that's far superior to the acting in the new live action movies and while the cell animation might not be the most technically proficient animation it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced the background paintings vary from traditional fantasy motif to outright abstraction but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film if you're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then i can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting transcendental imagery and jrr tolkien then this film is a must see
<START> i just came back from the montreal premiere of zero day and i'm surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie basically the blame is about coccio doing an easy and overplayed social message well mr i'm a reviewer it's an easy and overplayed critic of movies with a social charge br br not that i want to expose my life here but i come from a small town with a similar school than these guys go reject ignorance on the menu thing is i understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror high schools have became battle fields of conformity it's a real ugly sight you need to fight your way into being like the others it's hard to explain bit a lot of people dosen't realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence meanwhile parents are closing their eyes and smiling about how their life in their comfortable suburb is perfect br br the real motive of the movie isn't about what is driving them it's about this death like calm suburb and everybody closing their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere of a perfect town cal expressed it well it's a wake up call drama is everywhere and it can take every shape in that case little dramas like andre being called a faggot for wearing a j c penny shirt are shaping into being the worse nightmare of a whole town andre cal took the most extreme way to express their pain the malaise of unconformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like the others to be accepted br br i like particularly the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of andre cal like if with the pain they communicated cal andre have communicated their blind rage to their community their refusal to think about the causes of some acts br br it might seemed aggressive as a movie but coccio is meditating more than whining or enunciating what andre cal are living is a reality and a scary one that might get to other kids br br disturbing movie home making and strong feeling made ben coccio do a very very disturbing movie
<START> the haunting is yet another bad horror remake with phony overdone special effects and a big cast of on screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever except maybe for the cinematography yes remakes aren't all bad but remakes directed by jion da bont definitely are i suppose that the a list actors liam neeson catherine zeta jones owen wilson are there to distract us from the boring plot ridiculous special effects and terrible attempts at scaring it's audience however this is a movie not a tabloid magazine we don't care whose in it we care about the characters and story two things this film missed the storyline is like taking the classic novel the haunting of hill house and ripping out four chapters and then using whatever's left for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplained the characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good you don't really care about any of the characters at all lily taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like she's 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention what a horrible screamer she is lily taylor isn't made for the horror genre at all the ghosts are stupid and cheesy they look like a bunch of casper the friendly ghost's and the ghost of hugh cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper for halloween with a smoke machine there is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and it's not even funny unintentionally just plain sad the house is pretty and well designed that is probably the only positive thing about this movie it looks nice but that doesn't save it from it's brutal everything else i can honestly say i felt like i was wasting my time watching the haunting on tv for no price so i would've been even more pi ed if i had paid to see it but luckily it was on scream channel overall the haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects a poor attempt at horror
<START> this one is considered a key pre code film Â from the director who later made the musical biopic the jolson story 1946 but also the paranoid sci fi invasion u s a 1952 Â and features one of barbara stanwyck's best early roles br br she's supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day Â george brent douglass dumbrille edward van sloan nat pendleton and john wayne at one point addressing stanwyck with the titular nickname derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout in the former category and in the latter robert barrat as stanwyck's father donald cook as her most tragic conquest alphonse ethier as her elderly mentor Â more on this later arthur hohl as a lecherous politician and henry kolker as cook's boss and father in law whom stanwyck also seduces curiously scenes in which walter brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors br br abetted by crackling i e typically hard boiled dialogue and realistic anton grot sets the narrative contains unexpected overtones of nietzschean philosophy fed to our small town heroine by the intellectual ethier stanwyck complains to him early on that she's no ball of fire which of course contradicts her later comedy Â directed by howard hawks and co starring gary cooper Â of that name under ethier's auspices she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the new york firm she's eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one Â relating to an ambitious statesman's lust for power Â in sergei eisenstein's october 1927 sociologically it's also interesting that stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maid companion br br the first two thirds of the film are simply terrific at first i found the latter stages somewhat disappointing Â because i was expecting to see stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedly introduced george brent character while he ignores herÂbut just like the others he's soon under her spell on second viewing however this aspect felt less jarring Â as it's evident that stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused and that her tenure in paris has softened her even if she tries to cling to her hard earned wealth for as long as it's possible br br released on dvd by warners as part of their forbidden hollywood volume 1 collection the film is presented in two strikingly different edits Â a recently unearthed pre release version and the tamer theatrical release print among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to stanwyck's life as a tramp from the age of 14 though it's heard in the accompanying trailer while many other scenes have been shortened i e censored for content the violent fisticuff which develops between stanwyck and hohl after she resists his advances the seduction at the railroad car the scene in which dumbrille is surprised with stanwyck by cook the shooting followed by a suicide only shots are heard in the shorter version stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing again only brent appears in the version released to theaters etc tha latter then utilizes alternate takes for some scenes Â and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version however we also get an obviously tacked on happy ending the pre release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open ended note and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by ethier to stanwyck in new york which basically has the function of substituting all references to nietzsche
<START> oh dear the first time i heard of this bad show was when one of my friends was yelling like an idiot johny test while we were playing video games i thought he was confusing johny quest by the way one of the best cartoons i've ever seen in my life and changing the quest with test its something weird that i'm wrong but actually i was wrong he wasn't changing nothing he heard of this show br br one day while watching tv i heard that cartoon network was going to be released i wasn't sure of what was the plot of this show so i adventured myself to watch it and here is my answer i want my damn hour back because i watched this crap and my gym partner's a monkey br br this is one of the worst shows i've ever seen first the beginning with the most stupid song in the world then the plot oh where are my manners i haven't said the plot of this show is about a boy who has to amazingly intelligent sisters that have a lab and make experiments with their own brother ohhh now i see why his name is johny test he is the test of his sisters experiments br br you know i honestly miss dexter's lab before it was transformed to the new dexter a total crap too this is a bad copy of that old good show except that this show is amazingly bad don't watch it make something more productive in that half hour than watch this crap
<START> the line of course is from the lord's prayer thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven sweden especially its far north is not my idea of heaven 30 degree c winter temperatures are a little on the low side for me but the good folk who live there no doubt think they are in god's own country br br the storyline here is a familiar one acclaimed international musician daniel suffers health breakdown in mid career goes back to the little village in northern sweden where he was born persuaded by the local pastor to help out with the church choir he turns some unlikely talent into a class act and they enter a contest held in innsbruck austria there are echoes sorry of the band players of brassed off the models of calendar girls and the dancers of the full monty but of course he causes plenty of emotional upheaval as some of the more downtrodden villagers realise their worth and revolt against their oppressors he faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious pastor but nothing except death is going to stop him br br despite the somewhat corny story we get to know and like many of the characters who come across as people rather than caricatures despite many of them being recognisable types' i did wonder about the wife beater being unpunished for so long Â sweden is one country in the world where such violence is pretty strongly discouraged he was also a bit young to be one of the bullies of daniel's youth and the puritanical pastor with a secret passion for girlie magazines was a bit of a stereotype but marvellously realised by niklas falk br br michael nyqvist is simply wonderful as daniel the frail but driven musician and there's some nice music as well i was rapt for the whole two hours the ending is what you make of it i guess but it's not spoiling it to say daniel achieves what he set out to do
<START> i recently stumbled across this film on tnt five minutes into it while on vacation in florida hey there has to be some down time in the hotel right i was initially surprised to see melissa joan hart in any feature length film on tnt i mean drive me crazy isn't that old already is it br br but i stuck with it and was thoroughly surprised and entertained melissa plays her role as the psychotic jennifer excellently the supporting cast nick the ex con boyfriend karen her best friend and her life controlling parents all added a great degree of believability the twist at the end was a nice closure to this tale of the girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everybody br br if you get a chance check it out br br
<START> as most off you might off seen star wars return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they m might have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one live tv when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi wan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader real name anakin skywalker when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground
<START> while william shater can always make me smile in anything he appears in and i especially love him as denny crane in boston legal well this show is all about glitz and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and down br br it has none of the intelligence of millionaire none of the flair of deal or no deal br br this show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill in the time br br i watched it of course just to check it out i did watch it for over 45 minutes then i had to turn it off br br the best part of it was william shatner dancing on the stage he is a hoot unfortunately this show will not make it br br that's a given
<START> there is an awful lot wrong with this picture beginning with a script that is both obvious and redundant courtney cox plays a comic book artist who escapes to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city she immediately is stalked by a local who appears quite unhinged craig sheffer and who seems to be attempting a third rate mickey rourke imitation d b sweeny is a local cop who is supposedly there to protect and serve meanwhile the script manipulates the audience as to who's really the good guy logic flies out the window after the first ten minutes and never returns and there are more unanswered questions than there should be if you think blue desert might be saved by the wonderful philip baker hall you will be disappointed his part is insignificant just like the entire movie merk
<START> williamson's accent is tough to wade through he speaks incredibly quickly like he is in a rush to get through the lines during the soliloquies he acts as if he is talking to someone when he is supposed to be talking to himself all that and his bald spot just annoyed me he was just too old for this role in reading other accounts of williamson maybe he got this role because he was mad and the director decided to do a bit of life imitates art or forced method acting when the actors declare hamlet mad you believe it marianne faithful is a stunning beauty and could botch the role of ophelia and still get a pass the set is dark and foreboding but it does look as if shot in a real castle especially the scenes in the tunnels corridors where the dead king shines as a great light in the sky
<START> no awards show can please all the people clearly if your favorite movies didn't win you will say the show wasn't very good that's understandable br br however the 74th annual academy awards will be remembered for one magical moment of hollywood history br br woody allen's first appearance ever at the academy awards br br allen has often shunned the awards as being self aggrandizing and pointless and has never attended even though he has won several of the coveted awards br br when the 74th academy awards were held the nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the world trade centers in new york when it came time to pay tribute to the city of new york they decided to show a video of the great movie moments form the city of cities then the announcer simply said br br ladies and gentleman oscar award winning director woody allen br br the place erupted in an extremely long standing ovation the entertainment industry finally got to give their applause to the man from new york who usually avoids the hollywood scene as the applause died down woody applied some of his legendary wit to the situation br br some highlights br br thank you very much that makes up for the strip search br br i thought they wanted their oscars back he joked i panicked because the pawn shop has been out of business for ages and i had no way of retrieving anything br br but that wasn't it i couldn't work it out because my movie wasn't nominated for anything this year then it hit me maybe they were calling to apologise br br allen also disclosed why he had overlooked his lifelong oscar aversion for this one special night br br for new york city i'd do anything so i got my tux on and came down here said allen br br it's a great great movie town it's been a great moving and exciting backdrop for movies and it remains a great great city br br
