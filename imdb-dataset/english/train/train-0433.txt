<START> charles bronson continued his 80's slump with what could possibly be his worst movie of the decade if not ever in it he plays a detective who goes to great lengths to track down a pimp who has abducted an asian girl and is currently selling her to the highest bidder it's a shameful attempt at action and is quite possibly the most depressing movie ever made a lot of people consider the death wish sequels to be bronson's worst movies the death wish sequels weren't great movies but were in most cases competently made and very watchable kinjite however is an utterly dull thriller which is punctuated by mean spirited racism and child molestation it really is a rephrensible film and all of it is made worse by the fact that it tries to preach a law and justice mentality that is too overwrought to really say anything indeed the movie begins with underage sex being interrupted with bronson then anally raping the pedophile with a dildo the chicago theater i watched this in just gasped at the awkwardness of this scene only to gasp at the awkwardness of the pimp raping the girl in this film it has no point other than to exploit and really the movie wasn't well written enough to rise above the exploitation level and deliver something that would work bronson seems more into things but clearly this is far too repugnant to save i want to point out that i think charles bronson is the coolest actor ever but this effort is ultimately his worst the action sequences are poor also br br 1 2 out of 4 awful
<START> famous for introducing the world to hedy lamarr and full frontal nudity but it's oh so much more in fact this is one of the pinnacles of cinematic poetry up there with some of the seminal works of 1930s art cinema in the same prestigious group as under the roofs of paris tabu olympia and even l'atalante it's nearly a silent relying mostly on its miraculous images and also its fantastic symphonic score by giuseppe becce it's a masterpiece of cinematography and music yes and also of editing direction writing and acting a good 90 of the film moves along perfectly machatÃ½ seems an expert at using motifs perhaps not as subtle as it could be and perhaps a bit overused but the appearances of objects like insects lights and horses carry the story forward beautifully the small snatches of dialogue are thankfully unintrusive they don't jar as much as one would imagine the final bit is odd to say the least reminiscent of russian silents we have a montage of workers this barely makes sense in the course of the narrative but it's so gorgeously done that i refuse to harp too much on that flaw ecstasy is a film that is desperately in need of rediscovery it belongs amongst the best films ever made
<START> rather then long dance sequences and close ups of the characters which made the film drag on the movie would have been better served explaining the story and motivations of the characters br br the marginalisation of nubo the minister auntie mother and the dumbing down of the dynamic and important rivalry between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri made the movie lack any real depth if you hadn't read the book you would not really understand why sayuri loved the chairman and why mameha became her mentor at all br br visually the film was stunning and the actors all did the best with the c rate script they were given but that was all that was good about this movie
<START> i was expecting the movie based on grendel the book written by john gardner in the late 1970's it was based on the beowulf epic but told from the perspective of the monster br br whatever you may think of gardner's book a movie based on the beowulf epic should not be entitled grendel when it doesn't say anything more about the monster beyond the few pathetic scenes in which the cg monster is shown as nothing more than a modified predator br br on top of this the writers should also be punished for screwing up the original story so badly and contributing to the continued growing ignorance of mass tv audiences throughout the us br br typical hollywood to get this so wrong br br very disappointing and a complete waste of time
<START> in his brief 40 years on earth author jack london managed to cram as much adventure and incident as would seem possible this 90 minute film purportedly a biography of the man's life but patently fictionalized doesn't even scratch the surface and remains a story very ripe for a modern day retelling here michael o'shea in one of his first roles portrays london and his performance is both rugged and sympathetic he is not the problem here nor is a young and very beautiful susan hayward playing his future wife charmian whose biography on london is the basis for this film london's life has here been broken down into a series of episodes which the film skips lightly through so we have brief incidents with london as an oyster pirate a sealer in the bering sea a gold prospector in the yukon and a correspondent during the russo japanese war colorful events for sure but hardly given anything like in depth treatment and alfred santell's direction he also directed one of susan's first films our leading citizen in 1939 is lackadaisical at best making things rougher here is a very poor quality dvd with a crummy looking print source and hissy sound perhaps the best thing about this movie rental for me was one of the dvd's extras a catalog of all the alpha video films featuring hundreds and hundreds of full color movie posters let's just hope that these films are in better shape than jack london
<START> possible spoilers not sure br br while watching the lion king 1 1 2 i couldn't help but have mixed feelings about the whole film it is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes but there is nothing about it that would give you the same sort of feeling that the lion king did the story for those who haven't read the other reviews is about how timon and pumbaa meet and how they affect events in the original lion king br br there are actually some very funny jokes in the movie my favorite part is when they show the pair raising simba however for me the worst parts have to be when they show timon and pumbaa directly interfering with the events of the original i can never look at the circle of life or can you feel the love tonight sequences the same way again i'm okay with the i just can't wait to be king sequence br br the voice talents are excellent nathan lane and ernie sabella do a wonderful job as do matthew broderick the guy who does rafiki and the hyenas even the actor who does young simba sounded enough like jonathon taylor thomas for me but why did they even include a voice actor for zazu he literally had only 2 lines and neither were very necessary the additions of julie kavner and jerry stiller only add to the talent although you still can't hear timon's mom's voice and not think of marge simpson br br there are some scenes that seem to not fit in with the original the one coming to mind being when they are pride rock at the end how did they have time to fit in the initial fight with the hyenas br br as for the dvd itself you can't help but feel that for a 2 disc set the special features are especially lacking they could have easily fit a commentary or another aspect ratio on the 1st disc i enjoyed the who wants to be king of the jungle game even if it is the most shameful example of cross promotion i've ever seen some of the questions are actually difficult br br overall a good movie though not nearly as good as tlk or even tlk2
<START> rarely has such an amazing cast been wasted so badly griffin dunne rosanna arquette illeana douglas ethan hawke dennis hopper christopher walken and john turturro all jumped on board only to be torpedoed by a script that seems like nothing more than a hollywood in joke attaching martin scorsese's name to this was probably the draw but the end result is way less than the sum of it's parts resembling a nightmare gone horribly wrong each scene seems more contrived than the next search and destroy is nothing more than abstract stylish self indulgent nonsense and the entire film is decidedly dull merk
<START> first i realize that a 1 rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst this movie gets that from me because as one reviewer points out it's not bad in a self aware over the top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value it simply misses its mark on every count contains possible spoilers the dialog is completely disingenuous the continuity is so deliberate it's painful daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love and with his final word the flamenco dancers start the mock shock of what's her name see i don't even remember her character's name let alone the name of the forgettable actress when her husband the baldwin first tells her that her friend is the bad guy the car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things vegetable carts gone flying cars crashing into each other motorcycles going down the stairs people nearly being hit but remarkably no one is oh that's right except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds and an approaching car apparently didn't notice him there hmmm br br it's becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made there is so much pressure in the film industry to make money you'd think that someone in hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing now there's a novel idea br br my suggestion don't see this film don't rent the dvd don't watch it on cable there are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied

<START> i picked this dvd up at the dollar store the dvd was on the 2 for 1 rack but since it had michael madsen in it i thought that since i had never seen the movie i bought it anyway br br i must say that i didn't like the movie the movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else i found that the director's use of flashbacks did not add to the story line for me i would have preferred to view the story line in chronological order br br i won't throw it away like one of the other commentators but it may be quite awhile before i would consider watching this movie again br br who knows since it was michael madsen's film debut maybe it might have some archival value at some future date
<START> what could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women they're supposed to be spying on and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banal br br but the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense you can see real people behind the unreal lines and the directing is wonderful each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too long br br i showed this to several friends in the mid 80s because i was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie the friends enjoyed it too
<START> i am very sorry to say this but thunderbirds does not even come up with a loud pop never mind any thunder at one stage i gave serious consideration to walking out of the cinema i stayed in the forlorn hope that the film might improve i was to be disappointed it did not get any better it got worse if that is at all possible had i gone to see the film with the thought that it was going to be a spoof i would still have been let down they had an excellent opportunity to make a great franchise of films here they have totally wasted that opportunity bill paxton and sir ben kingsley should be embarrassed to have there names attached to this film and jonathan frakes well what can i say he should be embarrassed and ashamed would not be to far from the truth i saw this film at a pre release showing i had been waiting to see it most eagerly having grown up in the sixties with the original shows to say i was disappointed would be something of an understatement one final thing i will say about the film was the puppets in the tv shows were just a bit more wooden than where the actors in the film
<START> director fred schepisi roxanne directs this well intentioned but inferior comedy about albert einstein matthau trying to hook his scientific niece ryan up with ordinary guy tim robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950's to get ryan to like robbins einstein tries to make robbins look like a brilliant scientist the idea is cute but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue tim robbins meg ryan and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat but are unable to rescue the film its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie i would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of meg ryan
<START> this is superb the acting wonderful sets clothes music but most of all the story itself br br i am amazed there aren't more reviews of this movie certainly one of the best of the 1980s br br it's also a wonderful movie to see in tandem with the great random harvest which has much the same opening crisis br br a middle aged unknown english w w i officer is in a hospital toward the close of the war suffering from shell shock and complete amnesia without any idea of his name origin or anywhere he belongs he proves to be a very wealthy established man when he recovers he will not remember the years before the war br br but there the movies' resemblances end br br my warmest thanks to all who participated in the movie particularly the actors ian holm alan bates ann margret what a great and surprising casting choice glenda jackson julie christie br br this one stays with you forever
<START> kudos to the patience of paul muni who spent hours and hours in the makeup room each day to look the part of zola muni was the one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and i wonder how many people today other than classic movie buffs know anything about it he was a giant in the business for at least a decade he could have won the academy award for this performance which would have given him two in a row as he won it for playing louis pasteur the year before my own opinion is that while he tended to overact a bit i still think he was one of the great actors of the golden age whatever part he played you were riveted to the screen watching him br br unlike the pasteur role i thought this story smacked of a little too much of what we've seen in the last 60 years going overboard to make a liberal hero even in 1937 hollywood couldn't suppress its disdain for police or for the military here making it a point to tell us how corrupt those organizations are filmmakers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated in that regard this film is way ahead of its day since we've seen this big time since the 1960s br br however it must be noted the facts support this story it also does not in any way diminish zola's accomplishments as a social reformer getting rid of certain evils good for him i wish they had spent more time showing that than concentrating on one trial
<START> my wife and i really had high hopes for this film but it was a major disappointment it was a native american version of mr magoo a pathetic father who fails at everything he tries e g fishing hunting in an obvious way he subjects his family to his wild fantasies his visions are not only ridiculous but in the process he lies to his son numerous times about various obvious things words cannot express how bad this film is the children and wife are very real which makes the film even sadder i don't get the humor unless you like laughing at other people making a fool of themselves i don't get how this could have come up for awards save your bucks it's not worth the rental
<START> best stephen king film alongside it though this one is more fun than scary br br this one's got it all br br a great cast with a alice krige and brian krause and a fun cameo from king himself br br well dosed horror in an amusing storyline br br great use of music santo johnny's sleepwalk in particular br br likeable characters in a typical king setting middle of nowhere village br br lots of humor you can't really get good scares here because it's too much fun and over the top br br old but really nice makeup effects like they don't make anymore br br a 4 5 rating i don't get it really when was the last time a horror film was as much fun as this one
<START> imagine that you are asked by your date what movie you wanted to see and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer about the grudge so in good faith you recommend seeing that movie it is the halloween season after all and it did boffo box office this past weekend so it must be pretty good so you go br br and you're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it does and you hear yourself audibly saying that can't be the end of the movie but alas it is br br and imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed for recommending such a dog of a movie you think that your date thinks you're a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship actually it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was i see no future for miss gellar in the movies and suggest that she sticks to television in the future actually it won't be long before she is consigned to flea market conventions selling buffy memorabilia and it can't happen soon enough if you ask me horrible horrible horrible the plot didn't make sense continuity was terrible it's apparent that the whole ending was contrived to have a grudge ii the return of 'cat boy'
<START> a bunch of kids set up a theatre to have an all night horror movie marathon however as the night goes on there's somebody among them killing them off one by one who is it and why i saw this in a theatre way back in 1991 i was looking forward to it but boy it did not work at all the premise is a good one they have a very appealing young cast and some pros like dee wallace stone on board but it doesn't work the story stops making sense halfway through that could be because of some huge editing before the film was released the killings are relatively bloodless how this got an r rating is beyond me and the unmasking of the killer at the end was boring and stupid br br it's really too bad this movie had potential with a better script this could have become a great horror film as it stands though it's mostly forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassed by it i heard stone won't talk about this one i give it a 3 and that's just for the cast
<START> i read comments about this being the best chinese movie ever perhaps if the only chinese movies you've seen contained no dialogue long drawn out far away stares and silences and hack editing then you're spot on br br complicated story line hardly try juvenile and amateurish exquisite moods and haunting memories hardly try flat out boring and trite br br this was awful i could not wait for it to be over particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of how are you i'm fine are you sure yes wow what depth of character i guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for them br br as a huge fan of many chinese japanese and korean films i was totally disappointed in this even zhang's sentimentally sappy the road home was better than this
