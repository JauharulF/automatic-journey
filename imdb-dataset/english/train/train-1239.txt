<START> i am oh soooo glad i have not spent money to go to the cinema on it it is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like the thing final fantasy the abyss etc framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario i really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline which additionally is also senseless moreover there is nothing to watch the fx'es look like there were taken from a second hand store you generally saw all of them in other movies but it is definitely a good lullaby
<START> this movie was a long build up with no climax people whom refer to the swordfight in the end as great must either be out of their minds or have none way too often this movie got soft i am not saying that soft movies are bad but no matter how fond you are of sugar it should have no space on a t bone steak this movie was supposed to be about vengeance for crimes committed against a culture but it ended up being a petty bar brawl and there was only one of them who actually knew what a sword was tim roth's character and yes he plays him well rob roy was a weak hero with no knowledge of how to use a sword and the way he won was a disgrace as a drama this movie had it's periods but the best performance in it has to go the nature of scotland this is one tad breath short of being termed as soap in my book
<START> an excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman one of the cop pÃ©rier killed her but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other montand the unlucky montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her and pÃ©rier doesnt know either that montand had an affair with the girl montand must absolutely find the killer and what a great ending highly recommended
<START> if you want to make a movie like this have the threat be real don't surround your patsy with a bunch of bonzos there is no credibility here the plot is dull and unbelievable the acting is even worse i thought that i was watching arthur lake dagwood who is one of the worst actors in history when i saw the main character oh well at some point he has to face the music and get fighting mad i don't care do you there are all these long scenes set in this austere office the furniture made out of cardboard or masonite people talk and smoke and don't do anything most of the action happens in a five minute sequence after that it's over don't bother
<START> in my honest opinion everyone should see this movie at least once it really put things in perspective as i watched it though it was fictional this movie is about something that could happen to your children br br it shows how easily two kids can hide both their hatred for their school and their plans to murder innocent students this film would not have worked in any other format they pulled off the hand held camera perfectly br br it reminds us of april 20th 1999 when eric harris and dylan klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves it also reminds us of the media storm that followed after everyone wanted to see the rampart video and everyone wanted to see the basement tapes br br this movie is a fictional version of our dreams coming true we get to see the kid behind the monster br br the only bad thing about this movie is that it did not do well on the market and few people even know it existed if it would have had a single preview on a single blockbuster movie everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was about zero day br br i believe this is the best film adaptation of a school shooting of the few that have truly attempted it the shooting itself only takes up about ten minutes of the hour and a half long film because it mostly focuses on cal and andre and what they did up to that point br br if you have not yet seen this movie go rent it and watch it i guarantee that when it is finished you will be speechless
<START> ok me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b movies since we do them ourselves anyway the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff and tom savini there is just no way this movie can fail right wrong it just seems like such a waste there was really no story the dialog was terrible is anyone there x 1000 the characters were well they really lacked any kind of personality the effects were terrible and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff we were sitting the whole movie waiting for something anything to happen but no oh here comes the nymphs great oh they're kissing again and now for the violence ok nothing really happens again oh now they run around and the closeups of eyes again oh heres tom savini oh he died right ok maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen no oh cool a severed head the end oh crap and finally since i'm so full of myself i'll tell you this give me a van six actors a weird looking house tom savini a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and i could make the coolest movie you've ever seen i've made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects better acting and a better script than this what is this johannes guy doing making cool movies is easy it could have been so great i'm really upset
<START> vince lombardi high school has a new principal the evil ms togar mary woronov she intends to ban rock and roll music all together she butts head with riff randall p j soles who loves the ramones also the head of the school football team vincent van patten can't seem to connect with any girl not realizing cute kate rambeau dey young is in love with him br br an instant midnight movie this was put in general release and almost immediately bombed but as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s i remember attending more than a few of those when i was in college it was like a party people were singing along with the songs laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun br br seeing it now as an adult i can't imagine why i loved this so much the script is juvenile and full of groaners that i couldn't believe i was hearing characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place what saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by soles and woronov who is really enjoying herself also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles way over the top as they should as for the ramones i was never a fan i do like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me if you're a ramones fan you might give this a higher rating br br spoiler warning this is mostly for kids it has a pg rating who will probably find it silly but fun i especially think they'll like the end when the high school is blown up spoiler end br br so if you're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this otherwise stay away i give it a 7
<START> i watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best female friend i got my judgment teeth pulled out so i didn't feel very good br br i ended up liking it big time it's a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship unwanted betrayal power money drug traffic and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign jail br br the acting is on it's prime level two of the women that i lust the most star and that's a good thing claire danes is as cute and charming as always while kate beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance bill pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities br br there are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience plus it shows the difficult times at thailand br br this is an underrated movie not many films like this one have come up in recent history it should make you reflex about many things
<START> i rated this a 3 the dubbing was as bad as i have seen the plot yuck i'm not sure which ruined the movie more jet li is definitely a great martial artist but i'll stick to jackie chan movies until somebody tells me jet's english is up to par
<START> this is definitely one of the best movies i've ever seen it has everything a genuinely touching screenplay fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to watch an actually elegant romance it's a shame that that kind of romance just doesn't seem to exist anymore lovely songs and lyrics especially the final song an artistic score and costumes and sets that make you want to live in them the ending was only a disappointment in that i was expecting a spectacular film to have a brilliant end but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of movies out there definitely check this movie out over and over again there are many details you miss the first time that deserve a second look
<START> did i step in something or is that bad smell coming from daybreak 1 2 god was behind everything what has god got to do with sci fi god is only the answer when you can't think up a sensible explanation for something in fact this is exactly the problem with the series finale they obviously couldn't think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how kara thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper how her old viper and charred body ended up on earth 2 why baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head why 6 has an imaginary baltar in her head etc so they explain it with angels or just don't explain it at all br br the plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a basestar through for example why does galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl hera particularly after adama said there was no way he'd attempt a rescue because they found out the location of the cylon base that's not a good reason to sacrifice the crew's lives and how did anders know the location and what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters' lives before the war it's like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment br br the people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical christians on a mission to spread 'the word' forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot the important message the writers wanted to get across is don't put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction god is your ultimate salvation tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment br br imagine in the final movie of the star wars series they tell you there is no force instead a jedi actually gets his power from jesus then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewoks would this be a good ending no it frakken' wouldn't
<START> i am a big fan a faerie tale theatre and i've seen them all and this is one of the best it's funny romantic and a classic i recommend this for all ages it's great for little kids because it's well cinderella and great for adults and teen because it's funny and not over the top i watched it when i was little and i still watch it now it has great lines that my family and i quote all the time the acting is great and it never gets old if you like fairy tales and romances you will love this i've watched many a cinderella movie in my time and this is the best of them all sorry disney i highly recommend this movie and all the faerie tale theatre shows they all appeal to all ages and are all unique and very entertaining
<START> let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice i do not consider myself a trekker or trekkie those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors the acting was better than average but the plot held no surprises they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation now as to the historical errors if you call them that the first capitan to pilot the enterprise was commander april then capt pike jim kirk etc according to a statement made by both riker and kirk we dicovered the klingons and educated them and gave them the technology that's the reason a prime directive was created but like i said these are no reason to discredit this fine series i hope the plots will get deeper and then special effects can take a backseat
<START> despite of the success in comedy or drama the turkish directors are failure in horror thriller okul d bbe are good examples for the awful horror turkish films br br but if you watch gen you will understand that it is a strike the atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark also the special features are colorful and not cheap the soundtracks fit the movie but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary br br as a result gen does not add any difference to horror movies but it does not disappoint thriller fans in this respect it is a success for yesilcam and turkey 7 10
<START> this movie really deserves the mst3k treatment a pseudo ancient fantasy hack n slash tale featuring twin barbarian brothers with a collective iq of hot water character names that seem to have been derived from a mad libs book and such classic lines as hold her down and uncover her belly the barbarians crosses over into the so bad it's good territory
<START> rated e contains violence br br i had the original spiderman game for the pc for a couple of years now i still have not beaten it because on windows xp there is a glitch on one level which i cant beat because of it so be warned if you have xp but for those who don't have xp give this game a try its a fun clean family game with action and its great for any spiderman fan in the game you play spiderman and you take on various criminals who commit crimes spiderman is a fun little game and i recommend it to any spiderman fan or a parent wanting a fun clean game for their kids br br 8 10
<START> the only other film besides soylent green that has such an air of hopelessness is on the beach both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms on the beach with nuclear war and soylent green with the environmental poisoning of the planet br br maybe there's cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we haven't reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now new york city still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in soylent green environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming for myself it also shows the right to life ethic run amuck obviously there's no family planning in this world either br br charlton heston is an nypd detective who lives with room mate edward g robinson who's old enough to remember the earth before catastrophe struck there's been a murder committed joseph cotten an executive with the soylent corporation a multi national concern that has come up with a food product some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world's population it's latest product is soylent green br br the investigation finds charlton heston getting his man but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the soylent corporation and the future of mankind as heston shouts in the end that soylent green is made of people that we've become a race of cannibals the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative we've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive br br this was the farewell performance of edward g robinson and in his memoirs heston spoke movingly of robinson even though they had differing political views a few weeks after robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia he passed away in real life not many did but heston knew that robinson was terminally and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them br br though the timetable was off it doesn't mean that the world envisioned by soylent green may not come to pass hopefully we'll have not just the intelligence but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening
<START> wow i went to the video store tonight because i was in the mood for a bad b horror movie and i found this gem i looked at the cover and i thought it looked like just the movie for my mood i brought it home and put it on br br this movie was not the b horror movie that i had in mind this was much worse i wanted a bad movie but what i got i didn't know that crap like this existed amongst man this movie seemed like a 5 year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it br br i am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies he needs to work at a garbage dump shoveling crap where he belongs br br if you are thinking about renting this or buying it i will tell you the same thing that i would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide don't do it it's not worth it i really have nothing nice to say about this movie don't do it
<START> imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a one man spends 8 year's of his life and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself the murder technique is clear but a government unwilling to admit the truth let's a monster destroy dozens of lives when i think my job is stressful i merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick the devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by rea the comic and almost tragic at times relationship between rea and the sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies of the last 5 years the catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat while not nearly as well advertised and talked about as silence of the lamb's the plot was just as suspenseful rent or buy this movie today
<START> this movie sucked plain and simple okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist the rapist is a douche but the girl victim is partly to blame i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff but when the rapist tries to have sex with her she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything but when it comes to the rapist getting raped it's a pretty long rape scene there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching br br 3 2 10
