<START> after 'aakrosh' this was the second film for govind nihalani as a director till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india this movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence it was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released this movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood like'coolie' 'betaab' 'hero' in 1983 br br smithapatel in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs at one time she even gave up her love when the hero's ruthlessness touched the roof top br br there was another character in this movie which was played by om puri contemporary naseeruddin shah he played as an inspector turned alcoholic character the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero's ending br br in his debut film sadashiv amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent the anger which left half handedly continued in govind nihalani's other film drohkaal even after two decades this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew each one played their part par excellence
<START> this documentary begins with an interesting premise it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth sadly though after priming us with this the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non stop attack on christianity and pretty much focusing on the easy targets br br the writer director clearly has some issues with the church he is a former evangelical christian and has some legit anger and this film seems to be his form of release it'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded but as a whole the movie is disappointing
<START> i am a catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns taught by jesuit priests in high school college i am still a practicing catholic but would not be considered a good catholic in the church's eyes because i don't believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to br br so back to the movie its bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead there is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of diane keaton i never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good br br at first i thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate sister mary's emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith but it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy the tragedy of loss of life besides the two former students the lives of the aborted babies the life of the student's mom the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in god this is what is wrong with today's islam and yesterday's judaism and christianity
<START> i don't want to go too far into detail because i can't really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie the animation is crud and the story alternates between boring pointless to extremely irritating the humor was completely lost on the audience and yes ghost in the shell fans this is not an action sci fi or anything like that its an attempt at slapstick comedy and the humor just did not work after being translated it was a total chore to watch this movie and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything i wasn't expecting a ghost in the shell sequel but i was expecting something entertaining and it simply didn't achieve this yaaawwnnn rent kino's journey instead
<START> i have a 19 month old and got really tired of watching care bears all the time rooney is a great dancer who cares if he is gay this guy must have been a cheerleader or something br br beats barney cant get the songs out of my head must stop singing doodlebops songs now br br must have 10 lines of text so i must continue what about when the say all the canadian stuff like ooout aboooot whacky canadians jazmine is rhyming too much she must be dutch br br knock knock who's there dee dee super hottie br br bus driver bob cannot dance take lessons from rooney
<START> let this film serve as the death knell to the big twist films borne out of the 1990s known in some circles as the kyser soze syndrome this cinematic slight of hand has now been done to death by m night shayamalan and even ron howard used a variation in a beautiful mind however in revolver director guy ritchie known in some circles as mr madonna utilizes the soze motif in a far more obsequious manner br br jason statham with a highly questionable head of hair stars as jack green known to all as mr green he may or may not also be criminal mastermind mr gold or perhaps mr gold is an irritable spirit who can possess members of the underworld i'm not quite certain but i certainly don't care revolver is one of the most overwrought examples of cinematic excess i've had the displeasure to endure in quite a long time witness the fractured time structure the painful jump cuts the ceaseless inner monologues and the painfully pretentious animated sequence this everything and the kitchen sink directing style makes quentin tarantino's oeuvre look sedate the cinematic smoke and mirrors only lead me to believe that ritchie was as bored telling this trite tale as i was watching it br br the film is filled with moments of revelation that are supposedly shocking but they only come as news to mr green i wanted to like green as i always enjoy stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else here though he struggles along like a remedial reader in a university english literature class his lack of wit is only matched by the lack of restraint shown by his nemesis macha ray liotta feasting on scenery like a starving man at a smorgasbord liotta spits cries and fumes through the film in an embarrassing display of overacting and leopard print speedos br br there are no redeeming qualities to revolver it's yet another filmic faux pas from ritchie and might even outdo his wretched remake of swept away as his worst film yet
<START> i saw this film last night about 102 minutes and don't know what kept me in my seat i guess i just expected a film with gere would have some value in it eventually but nothing of value ever came on the screen the story is a silly excuse to pile on shot after shot of bondage and torture there is not a character in the film that does anything like real life the cutting style relies on jump cuts mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this vapid setup of a gang of sadists apparently running free for years and surprise the leader is the victim of an executed killer i don't see how gere a buddhist got involved in this violent sexist trash
<START> poor will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible german tv adaptaion of his classic play it's obvious that very little money was spent on it a stage riser a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set the movie was ineptly dubbed into english with the english voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines the whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it and just where was fonterbras in this movie anyway mst3k gave this sorry production the treatment it justly deserved br br to be or not to be i wish this movie never was in the first place
<START> generally i don't do minus's and if this site could i would give this movie 3 out of 10 meaning i really hated this movie i thought uwe boll's alone in the dark was the worst i've seen yet but at least i gave it a 2 5 out of 10 in my opinion stephen dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so i boosted the ratings a bit hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne bloodrayne would win a oscar for best movie if they were competing br br now to the plot this movie is about the btk killer which is fine but they've could have done better the start looked ok but that's it i had to fast forward most of it because the death's where boring i like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths i'm not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this sorry for rambling but there's nothing good to say about it because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this this thing of disaster uwe boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cake br br well sorry i couldn't explain the plot if there was one but that was the best i could now if you don't mind i'm going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and reminding me of how bad this movie scared me for life ok not for life
<START> interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve it also addresses the issue how we tend to ignore those among us who are not as outspoken and by doing this may miss out on a great opportunity the injection of comedy also makes watching the film an enjoyable experience a must see for anyone who is interested in a reflective yet comical look at life i am eagerly looking forward to your next product hope that you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment excellent work joanne
<START> not long enough to be feature length and not abrupt enough to a short this thing exists for one reason to have a lesbian three way there are worse reasons to exist one sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie misty fits snuggly into her outfit and is a very cocky girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character like lara croft that they make nude calenders of her you know that a soft core flick is set to explode unfortunately this is pretty pathetic especially the painfully fake sex scene between darian and misty where you can see her hand is fingering air watch this if you just can't get enough of misty or ruby who makes a nice blonde and has zee verst jerman akcent ever
<START> as someone who has lived with cerebral palsey for over forty years i find this movie to be inspirational if someone with such a severe case of cp as christie brown has can do so much then there's no reason that i couldn't achieve my own dreams daniel day lewis and brenda fricker both give awesome performances br br
<START> here's an excellent barbara stanwyck double bill on one disc the first movie and believe me the lesser of the two is mgm's to please a lady 1950 in which she is paired with clark gable it is essentially a star vehicle with gable as usual dominating the film with his screen presence here he plays a macho racing driver who gets some bad press from feminist reporter stanwyck and the battle of the sexes begins of course after much ado they eventually end up in each others arms and it all comes to a predictable and pleasing close a bit of a fluff of a move really but gable and stanwyck two icons of the golden age make it watchable br br but the real meat on this dvd is the second feature a marvellous and quite unknown little thriller called jeopardy produced by mgm in 1953 this is a wonderful little gem of a movie that hasn't dated one iota here stanwyck plays the wife of barry sullivan and mother to their young son lee aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote mexican beach when suddenly tragedy strikes a dilapidated wooden pier collapses trapping sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what yes the tide is coming in with not a soul in sight and unable to free him herself stanwyck sets off by car for assistance after driving some distance the only aid she can muster comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict ralph meeker who in return for his help wants more from her than money or a change of clothes i'll do anything to save my husband does she or doesn't she br br meeker runs away with the picture he turns in quite a brilliant performance once he comes into the film you simply cannot take your eyes off him an actor in the smouldering brando style he surprisingly never made much of his career in films although he gave splendid performances as the unsavoury disgraced cavalry officer in the outstanding mann stewart western naked spur 1953 and as one of the doomed sacrificial french troopers in stanley kubrick's powerful ww1 drama paths of glory 1957 his only real claim to fame was as mike hammer in mickey spillane's kiss me deadly in 1955 his performance in jeopardy should have done wonders for him but he had only a so so career in films he died in 1988 br br because of this release jeopardy can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic noir a memorable taut and exciting thriller thanks to fine performances tight direction by john sturges the crisp monochrome cinematography of victor milner and an atmospheric score by dimitri tiomkin extras however are no great shakes except for a radio version of jeopardy and trailers for both movies br br this disc is also part of a barbara stanwyck box set celebrating her centenary hard to believe that the lady would be over 100 years old if she was still around br br jeopardy an mgm winner
<START> flat soulless computer images on less than astonishing backgrounds animates a horribly predictable story in this film absolutely nothing takes you by surprise you can even tell when the bryan adams vocals are going to come in which are always at the wrong time br br the main character spirit the horse is given an annoying voice when he narrates what is happening the narration is not needed though as everything happening is really obvious you can even tell what the horses are saying although all they do is neigh which would be good but all the horses make exactly the same sounds one for warning one for sorrow one for laughing etc there is no variation between the horses' voices br br young kids might like this film though it's soppy enough for a family to sit down and watch and there's little danger of anyone being frightened if you have nothing else to do and want to watch a film with your kids this isn't a bad choice br br but otherwise this isn't recommended
<START> this movie wastes virtually every actor's talents in what could best be charitably called a potboiler br br despite it's action packed 'top gun' opening it is all downhill from there with plenty of stereotypes and unlikely situations following each other until you try to choke yourself on your popcorn br br there are so many dead end story lines in this movie i was guessing at one point it was made by splicing together a discarded tv series br br quinn's mexican drug lord role is laughable and his 'associates' plucked right out of a 1970's quinn martin cop show costner's character is wooden and gives us no reason to believe he actually fell in love with mendez' wife nor are we convincingly led to believe the wife is aching for companionship and will jump the first hot body coming along br br definitely a 'b' movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved
<START> this movie will promote the improvement of the mind read a book it's incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make i've seen b movies before but the c movie has just been invented i didn't think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into knights high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind my roommate who loves these types of movies even turned it off now that has to really tell you something if you watch this movie and like it i will pray for you
<START> really really bad slasher movie a psychotic person escapes from an asylum three years later he kills a sociology professor end of scene one semester yesterday later hey that's what the title card said a new sociology professor is at the school she makes friends with another female sociology professor who works there and starts dating another professor the students are all bored as are we br br there are a number of title cards indicating how much time has passed scenes are pretty short and cut to different characters somewhere else making for little progression of any kind a lot of scenes involve characters walking and talking or sitting and talking and serve little purpose despite the passage of time many of the characters are always wearing the same clothing sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time we ask ourselves how long has that body been there and also at least one of the dead people don't seem to have been missed by others br br the killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the breast another by stabbing him in the crotch and another by slicing her forehead is his knife poisoned or something br br the video box cover has a cheerleader there aren't any in the movie the rear cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown menacing a group of women in a dorm room the central redhead in the photo is in the movie but nobody ever wears such an outfit and there is no such scene the killer is strictly one on one
<START> i realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title this movie is not primarily about the act of riding giants but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport riding giants to change the emphasis br br in my teens i lived a block from the wedge one of the hardest breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world i've been out in 15 to 18 foot surf and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12 foot waves on many occasions that experience is why i am in complete awe of the surfers in this film the idea that jeff clark to all appearances a normal mortal could get away with riding maverick's by himself for over a decade is beyond my grasp the first safety rule of any water sport is never surf dive swim by yourself he went where sane people would not and lived to tell about it i wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left br br in the world of warm water the first shot of the waves at jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body these are not just scary waves these are uncontrolled bowel evacuation waves when we see laird hamilton not only surviving 40 to 60 foot waves i can hardly type those numbers but actually working the faces like a fun day at rincon i'm blown away there is a dedication and focus in big wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world br br this a great film i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are great big wave riders in the world outside the hamilton kalama crew and i think they deserved mention splice in ken bradshaw at outside log cabins and a 10 it is
<START> the acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay it was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes the ending was even worse everyone kept dying but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly ok they did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had etc the movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline the only reason i give this 3 10 is that i kind of feel bad for the young actors they needed better coaching they could have really made this an ok film but the screenplay and acting failed miserably
<START> lion king 1 1 2 is the funniest non theatrical release from disney i recently saw this movie again after not seeing it in many years i remember first time i saw it i didn't had any expectations at all and were pleasantly surprised by this watchable and highly entertaining movie br br is it better than simba's pride in many ways yes though simba's pride wasn't exactly bad it did suffer some problems lack of an good script and bad characterizations which made impact of what otherwise a okay film br br anyway it's nice to see timon and pumbaa's personalities blossom again in the way that we or certainly me loved about them in this film in simba's pride they were completely annoying and i didn't liked the timon and pumbaa series neither br br this film could easily have been a stupid one but fortunately the filmmakers didn't took the wrong turn and instead focused to make this film at times extremely hilarious there are a few jokes that adults can enjoy on their own the score is quite good there are two new songs which are catchy and two new characters timon's mom voiced by recognizable marge simpsons' julie kavner and uncle max which are enjoyable the friendship between timon and pumbaa are touchingly portrayed the emotional scenes are well integrated in the comical story and doesn't feel out of place which it could have easily done especially in comedies br br but is there something that distracts this picture from getting 10 votes from me yes there is although they fortunately doesn't impact too much but i'll mention them 1 many of the scenes from the first film are used in this one personally it was weird to see the old scenes integrated with the new ones br br 2 during the climax some of the jokes becomes lame br br 3 storywise this is timon's story and although the filmmakers try to integrate his tale with simba's it makes the screenplay feel a little rushed at times br br but hey those details doesn't impact this otherwise amusing movie it is the only really acceptable disney sequel which should be in every movie collection
