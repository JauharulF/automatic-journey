<START> i always enjoy seeing movies that make you think and don't just drip feed the answers to their audience revolver is one of these films and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow with a bit of concentration and an open mind i got it first time true it doesn't compare to other mind mucks like the usual suspects or memento but in its own right its an intelligent and thought provoking film br br another thing i really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is every scene every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages if you see it you'll know what i mean br br so to conclude watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it if not well no one ever said revolver is for everyone and that's my 2 cents
<START> very different topic treated in this film a straightforward and simple description of local chinese customs by looking at the daily operation of a public bath run by the old owner and his retarded son when older son returns home wrongly believing his father has died how every man in town makes his daily visit to chat play games discuss personal matters and get honest advice besides the usual spa like therapies when old man dies strong and loyal family ties make older son take charge so public bath operation is not disrupted and finally the arrival of modernization to end this way of spending relaxed hours and getting along the public bath has to be demolished making place for a commercial complex to be constructed
<START> the first time i saw it i got half of it but i watched and i knew later on it was about a salem witch trials they focused on the sara good's family she is famous for cursing a priest which came true in the film it depicts her daughter dorcas and her husband the spirit of ann putnam sara's husband comes to the future hunts this girl to redeem her soul which does happen at the end of the movie dorcas is depict as witch at 5years old who is burned at the stake which never happen ann putnam saves her from the flames the girl is safe she goes to ann putnam's grave to to see that is not empty but it is at first because she accuse her of witchcraft and lets her burn to death now that ann putnam saves her her spirit is redeemed and she is not a outcast to society for the salem witch trials
<START> i watched this flick yesterday and i have to say it's the finest horror film made for 36 000 i've ever seen sorry steckler the film is definitely worth seeking out if you are a zombie fan this movie reeks of soul and atmosphere some of the shots of the zombs are the best ever committed to film very creepy looking dusty webbed corpses slowly shamble to their screaming victims brrrrrrr br br hot saggy canadian women with sexy accents will keep you preoccupied before the horror rears its undead corpse eating head this film entertained from start to finish i couldn't ask for more than that my only complaint is that is was too short
<START> a glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never ending wet slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes 2001 a space odyssey miles apart in vision but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless a magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn you've probably seen this scene in the trailer but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and results an avalanche the horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible br br the movie traces two characters a mammoth named manfred ray romano and a buck toothed sloth john leguizamo as they try to migrate south they find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them they are joined by a saber tiger named diego denis leary whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap diego's meat eating family wants the mammoth most of all but diego's learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end br br there are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in shrek characters contemplate on why they're in the ice age while they could have called it the big chill or the nippy era some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends all the great guys are never around the sensitive ones get eaten ' throwaway lines galore whimsical comedy and light fingered adventure makes this one pretty easy to watch also food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that they consider dandelions and pine cones as good eating ' br br the vocal talents of romano leguizamo and leary make good on their personas while the children will delight in their antics the adults will fancy their riffs on their own talents there is some mild violence and intense content but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age old battle of good versus evil and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties the animators also make majestic use of background landscapes that are coolly fantastic br br
<START> i saw this movie with my family and it was great this film is more than just a documentary that offers not more than cold facts with long mono duologue's and lots of charts the complete power of this movie comes from the impressive pictures being filmed under water in the air or the arctic with watching this movie you can learn more about our planet than with just reading a book it shows that we are embedded in the circular flow of life this movie is not only for environmental fanatics although people that want to look a good movie with a message should watch it this movie taught me that we are not only living on the earth we live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us
<START> the league of gentlemen is one of the funniest strangest darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time so much so it paved the way for more comedies of its ilk many of which have copied the style but have never succeeded br br unlike every other sketch show around the characters of the league of gentlemen are all loosely connected firstly they all live in the fictional town of royston vasey in the back of beyond of northern england br br the first characters to greet newcomers are tubbs and edwrad the pig faced owners of a supposedly local shop situated so far away most of the residents probably don't know of its existence other oddities include the denton family with an obsession with hygiene chastity and toads hillary briss who sells a special yet thankfully unknown brand of meat pauline a restart officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens mr chinnery kind hearted vet and menace to all things four legged geoff tipps a plastics salesman with a vicious sense of humour often involving guns electric tubes and plums br br despite being a comedy at heart the league of gentlemen often transcends genres whilst never appearing to be spoofing or ripping off other people's material there are several horror references such as the disappearance of a hiker a pair of silent twins an obsessive circus owner and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds even more striking are moments when the series takes on a more sobre tone and aforementioned characters such as pauline and geoff are shown in a more sympathetic vulnerable light the film adaptation is the best demonstration of this but some fans may decide they belong local br br the equally underrated third series also takes a different route instead of sketches each episode focuses on an individual character with each storyline leading to one conclusion involving a plastic bag and a runaway theatre company van although many fans may not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two they're certainly signs to how inventive the league of gentlemen can be and how unafraid to explore new areas br br in short the league of gentlemen is definitely worth a look as like the welcome signs says you'll never leave
<START> i go to the cinema to be entertained there is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film from beginning to end there is no respite from the gray grinding reality of this woman's life it is one paced with no change of mood i remained until the end only because i was convinced that things must get better they don't and i don't think i was the only one as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close honestly depicting social depravation is no crime but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public a dreadful film
<START> a dreary hopelessly predictable film set in a most unpleasant setting lower coachella valley acting is as amateurish as any i've seen looks like a screenwriting 101 script however it does function as a great sedative
<START> the past creeps up on a rehab addict when he reconnects with his ill brother and a former girlfriend after what he hopes was his last stint in detox life's dramas presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable not even the writing has any bite or wit the cast is made up of attractive looking actors smiling glumly at one another and the music and photography are lugubrious a couple of the visual effects are laughable indie clichÃ© touches that reek of a puny budget although written and directed by a man this was produced by a woman and i'm not sure but i think this may be a distinct reason why this picture about two men estranged brothers growing closer never quite gels never feels natural or seems lived in it's an attempt to get inside a male relationship but the careful sterile presentation is a cheat no one's heart is in this living breathing or bleeding this material the perfect son is quickly diffused by too many cooks in the kitchen
<START> prior to this release neil labute had this to say about the 1973 original it's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack i'm like come on you may not like the new one but if that's your favorite soundtrack i don't know if i want you to like my film br br neil a word you might want to sit down for this too as lord summerisle says shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent see neil the thing about the original is that paul giovanni's soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it the filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical along with richard and danny thompson and bert jansch it practically kick started the 1970s folk new wave to undermine it is akin to imagining jaws without john williams or the buddy holly story without buddy holly the result's one of the most breathtakingly arrogant pointless remake of a british cult classic since sly stallone's get carter br br the original had apparently left nicolas cage disturbed for about two weeks so disturbed during that fortnight's window that he pitched the idea of re imagining one of the most nuanced films about inter faith struggle ever devised to a writer director previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism it's like some parlor game what would you get if sam peckinpah took on bambi or gaspar irreversible noe remade love actually actually i'd quite like to see that unfortunately someone took this parlor game seriously all labute's succeeded in doing is ripping out the original's guts while saddling it with his own gormless sex war preoccupations br br after failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash cage's highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor then he receives a letter from ex fiancÃ©e willow woodward this one trades on name homages for kudos now living on the private island community of summersisle Â that extra 's' stands for 'superfluous' Â and wants edward to help locate missing daughter rowan br br summersisle it transpires is a female dominated joint conceived as a haven for oppressed womenfolk and refugees from the salem witch trials here the matriarchs observe the olde ways and the few males are near mute breed mules it's like lilith fair on a grand scale summersisle's main export is honey Â a symbolic and literal headache for edward as he's allergic to bees beekeepers cries edward they seem to be everywhere on this island well that's probably because summersisle's main export is honey br br while making his investigations edward overhears of an oncoming mayday ritual called the time of death and rebirth he discovers the previous year's crop failed nearly dies from bee stings and eventually comes to the conclusion a conclusion which admittedly couldn't be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a timetable of events on the back of his hands that rowan will be burnt alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest he also meets the queen bee of the hive sister summersisle burstyn who has her own plans for him involving the eponymous wicker man the drone must die br br first the good news any concerns cage would be airlifted from the wicker man's flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black cia helicopters can be laid to rest he toast that's about it for the good news this is a story whose chapters were carefully written intones burstyn with sublime irony though retaining the basic cat and mouse premise and credits typography what's left subjects the original to a scorched earth policy br br crucial to shaffer's original screenplay was that his christian copper in accordance with ritual came to the island of his own free will Â and most importantly was a virgin the perfect sacrifice in reducing matters to a sexual as opposed to a religious power struggle labute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice by the time cage has worked out he was the bait you honestly couldn't care less br br and cage is one of the very worst things in this a lumbering drawling donkey Â an arsewit whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth goddamit he moans after he hallucinates a drowned rowan with all the mental torment of a man who's set his morning alarm clock half an hour too early one hopes it's his character's frequent reliance on pills that has reduced him to this state Â alternately fatigued then full of preppy overbearing vim if so it's a fine portrayal of an undistinguished iq addled with anti depressants if notÂit doesn't bear thinking about as willow the saucer eyed beahan is similarly dreadful presenting her lines as if in competition with cage for theÂmostÂhalf heartedÂdelivery while burstyn entirely lacks the mercurial menace to convince who's afraid of naomi wolf br br every element that made the original great Â the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs the ingenious score the dialogue lord summerisle's majestic you did it beautifully has been replaced with the rather less attractive you did it excellently whoah dude Â have been substituted for a meandering battle of the sexes thriller with occasional crash bang wallop namely walloping women this is a labute flick after all cage's sister beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes impotent little men will be hooting with glee at how them uppity hippie chicks finally got what was comin' to 'em hyuk hyuk br br the closing coda sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of genre clichÃ© in a bar two guys run into a couple of summersisle maidens on shore leave flirty fishing for fresh martyrs at the moment of their successful pick up you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camera br br one more thing keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count anything up to 10 tend to be not much cop the wicker man has 18 producers in total
<START> warning small plot details revealed br br i can find virtually nothing positive to say about this film it is written so badly that every character is a caricature yet it seems to take itself seriously it is poorly cast especially ralph macchio all baby faced 5 foot nothing of him as a streetwise tough plot elements are all drawn in black and white with every situation almost immediately escalating to some extreme climax br br most egregious of all plot element about to be revealed it has perhaps the most gratuitous and contrived nude scene in the history of semi serious film one can just imagine the filmmakers saying we need jobeth to shed her top hmmm i've got it early in the film let's give nick some ridiculous dialogue about baring yourself in the hallways then jobeth can use that line on him later and really bare herself in the hallway yeah that's the ticket br br i will give the producers credit for tackling a weighty subject in 1984 one that proved all too weighty in the late 90's with events like columbine however the execution is dreadful this film could have been a dark comedy in the vein of heathers a campy political statement like network or a serious examination like brubaker instead it tries to be all of these things and ends up being none of these things teachers get an f
<START> this is movie is very touching i don't care what people say about this movie this is a very good movie the performances by amitabh bachchan's role has the dying father is great because he wants to teach his son how to handle life in case something happens to him and akshay kumer was great in his role as the spoiled aditya thakur the supporting role of shefali shetty who played the role of sumitra thakur was magnificent priyanka chopra was good in her small role she had in the movie ragpal yadav as the brain dead servant and boman irani as the show off father in law have a very good connection and the comedy scene's were hilarious the direction is very good
<START> this movie was so bad that my i q went down about 40 points after seeing it it made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it it must of been some kind of personal favor to van damme
<START> this noir may not be the best remembered film from the era but it features a great mystery plot the common noir atmosphere and some good performances from its lesser known cast members robert siodmak the talented director behind the mystery horror classic 'the spiral staircase' directed this film two years earlier than the aforementioned film and shows a real flair for creating a dark and brooding atmosphere as well as creating a plot that both intrigues and fascinates the viewer phantom lady focuses on scott henderson a man married to a woman he doesn't like he picks up a lady in a big hat in a bar one night and the two agree to a 'no strings attached' night of fun however he then returns home to find his apartment infested by police officers and soon finds out that the reason they are there is because his wife has been strangled with one of his neck ties he's dismayed to find that no one he saw while with the mysterious woman can remember her and naturally the jury sends him down for the murder of his wife however luckily for him his beautiful female employee gets on the case br br the plot moves along nicely throughout and unlike many of the better known noirs this one features a few murders which make the proceedings more interesting in fact if it wasn't for the fact that it was made in the forties and shot in black and white i would swear phantom lady was an italian giallo the central characters are all interesting enough with alan curtis providing a good portrayal of the unfortunate victim and ella raines being effective as the female impromptu detective the real standout of the film however is franchot tone who provides a memorable performance as the insane villain of the piece the film also features a role for supporting actor extraordinaire elisha cook jr who features playing the drums in the film's most memorable segment if i was to criticise this film i would say that the identity of the murderer is revealed a little too early although phantom lady does deserve some credit on that front for the original way it goes about it the conclusion is satisfying and everything makes sense which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line and overall phantom lady is surely one of the greatest and most under seen noirs ever made
<START> it's about an embezzler peter ustinov who infiltrates a british company texa conn or something like that posing as a computer whiz and security expert he secretly learns to hack into the computer while gathering the admiration of his boss karl malden the enmity of his office rival bob newhart and the love of his inept secretary maggie smith br br some of the business details were a little murky to these non business oriented eyes but they're believable enough and i got the general idea ustinov the peculating peter establishes phony businesses in paris rome and stuttgart and uses texa conn's computer to send all kinds of money to these ersatz establishments the overseas companies of course consist of nothing more than himself ustinov and the addresses are an abandoned artist's loft in paris a barber shop in rome and a bakery in germany he simply visits them to collect the checks he's sent himself br br i didn't think i'd like it for the first few minutes because it seemed rather on the slow side i was expecting something with a faster tempo and more outrage along the lines of the pink panther or the lavender hill gang but this film insinuates itself into your good graces as you come to appreciate the understated humor in the plot the characterizations and the dialog br br probably it would be a bad idea to give away too many of the relatively subtle gags but here are some examples of the more noticeable br br ustinov to secretary smith let me have the assets of these companies smith assets what are they ustinov little female donkeys now nothing is made of this little exchange there's a quick cut and no delay for any laughter which is appropriate because one's reaction is more likely to be a smile than a laugh br br ustinov searches out that crummy loft in paris it's covered with cobwebs bricks are strewn around and a couple of the former occupant's paintings have been left behind the landlord doesn't speak english and ustinov knows no french ustinov points to a child like painting of a nude woman and chuckles ah a fam fye tal eh landlord chuckles too replies vous le prenez pour une anee ustinov oh annie so that's her name landlord oui ustinov entente cordiale mes amis if i got those genders wrong je m'excuse bob newhart as willard gnatpole has the hots for maggie smith and is supposed to be driving her home but tells her he's taking the scenic route there is an immediate sequence of suggestive traffic signs caution lay by give way yield ending with the imperious stop children there's another montage when ustinov's scheme is about to be discovered by the board of directors blurry rooftops police cars a farewell embrace from maggie ending with a sign prison wormwood scrubs br br well maybe one more i still can't get over malden as the boss declaring decisively i never agonize over decisions then gulping a handful of pills and washing them down with a glass of water br br the acting is unarguably fine it's bob newhart's best role for instance not that he had that many and not that his range wasn't limited but he's perfect in this part the musical score by laurie johnson obviously had a good deal of effort put into it she seems to have written a brief concerto for flute ustinov's passion is music and his overseas establishments are headed by false names like claude debussy and giacconino rossini stuttgart's phony president is somebody named schmidt and he's an anomalous clinker maggi smith is pretty sexy bourgeois and turns out to be not nearly so dumb as she seems br br delightful in its own quiet way but don't expect comic fireworks
<START> unlike another user who said this movie sucked and that olivia hussey was terrible i disagree br br this movie was amazing olivia hussey is awesome in everything she's in yeah she may be older now because many remember her from romeo and juliet but she's wonderful br br this story line may be used quite often but it's a unique movie and i'll fight back on anyone who disagrees i enjoyed this movie just as much as i have any other olivia hussey movie olivia's my girl and i love her work br br i saw this for the first time on saturday 4 14 07 and fell in love with it not only because's it's an olivia movie but because of it's unique story line and wonderful direction
<START> houseboat horror is a great title for this film it's absolutely spot on and therefore the only aspect of the film for which i can give 10 out of 10 there are houseboats there is horror there's even horror that takes place on houseboats but if there were ever a tagline for the film poster it would surely be 'something shonky this way comes ' for houseboat horror is easily the worst australian horror film i've ever seen not to mention one of the worst horror films i've ever seen and a fairly atrocious attempt at film making in general the good news is it's so bloody awful it sails straight through the zone of viewer contempt into the wonderful world of unintentional hilarity it's worth watching because it's bloody awful br br the category of 'worst' comes not from the storyline for the simple reason that there actually is one a record producer a film crew and a rock band drive up to the mystifyingly named lake infinity a picturesque rural retreat somewhere in victoria in reality lake eildon to shoot a music video someone isn't especially happy to see them there and possibly in an attempt to do the audience a favour starts picking them off one by one with a very sharp knife even more mystifying is how long it takes the survivors to actually notice this br br on the surface it looks like a very bog standard b movie slasher you've got highly annoying youths intolerant elders creepy locals one of whom a petrol station attendant would easily win a gurning competition and let's face it my description of the murderer could easily be jason voorhees ah but if only the acting and production values were anywhere near as good as the comparative masterpiece that was friday the 13th part vii unfortunately houseboat horror is completely devoid of both these things br br but in the end this only makes what you do get so ridiculous and amusing fans of one time 'late show' and 'get this' member tony martin will already be aware of some of the real dialogue gems 'check out the view you'll bar up ' while the actual song to accompany the music video is so bad it has to be heard to be believed i can't help wondering if writer director ollie wood hoped it would actually become a hit the horror element is comparable i think to b slashers of the genre and particularly of the period but there were times when i couldn't help imagining someone biting into a hamburger off screen and seeing a volley of tomato sauce sprayed at the wall on screen br br indeed if you've been listening to tony martin recommending this film as hilarious rubbish like myself i don't think you'll be disappointed any fans of 'so bad it's good' horror should not pass up the opportunity whether you'll 'bar up' or not though is another matter if on the other hand you are in search of genuine excellence in the australian horror genre get yourself a copy of the incomparable 'long weekend' and don't look back
<START> i really thought that this movie was superb not only is the history correct but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate i was a fan of emily blunt's portrayal of victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that vicotria became famous perhaps infamous for the romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of albert br br the technical aspects of the film are worthy of note as well i appreciated the beautiful score which moves quite wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story i also considered the cinematography to be outstanding some scenes leaving me quite breathless because of the lushness and splendor they depict br br there have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this film and it rates as one of 2009's best
<START> we rented five movies for new year's eve weekend and watched this one first all i can say is that there was no place to go but up after watching this one it was pointless and vulgar harvey keitel's script must have been easy to write just make two out every three words a curse word andie mcdowell is surprisingly good in a character roll but the movie has nothing else to recommend it
