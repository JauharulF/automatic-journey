<START> when i saw that this film was only 80 minutes long i thought we were in trouble condensing the gigantic w somerset maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen but you know the movie's not half bad and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers br br i've heard many film buffs complain that leslie howard was a wet noodle of an actor and he was but i can't think of anyone more suited to play the role of philip carey than a wet noodle for that's certainly what carey is howard plays him well which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly then finally take him out and buy him a spine br br ah and then there's bette as the girl with whom carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him i didn't know what on earth the appeal of mildred was in the book and the movie stays true to that detail but as played by davis she does become the most fascinating character in the story and if she's nasty and unlikable she's at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time davis's performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting much as brando's would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out stella in that little known tennesee williams play and it's not hard to see why davis is intense to the point of scary she makes no effort to wring any sympathy from the audience and she allows herself to look ugly and most unglamorous her appearance when carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed disease though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it's an std is shocking of course it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the production code went into effect if it had been made a year later you can bet things would have been a bit different br br yes much of the novel and many of its most interesting parts are left on the cutting room floor and the story really does become about carey and mildred and not much else i found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of maugham's novel but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they did br br grade b
<START> i'm a big fan of horror flicks and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine that said zombi 3 is one of the absolute worst films i have ever seen so needless to say i really enjoyed it it's the best bad movie i've seen in a long while the story has some similarities with dan o'bannon's return of the living dead but whereas that film was intentionally funny this one is the opposite it has some of the most laughable acting i've ever witnessed especially from the main scientist character his scenes with the general were just hysterical also the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy and the death scenes are often just downright stupid this of course makes it all the more fun possible spoiler the worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head which then opens its eyes and somehow flies out of the fridge obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string latching onto the guys neck killing him zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now it defies every law of physics known to man and it's one of the most absurd things ever filmed that's just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess i can't believe it's gotten so high a rating here if you are a fan of bad movies do yourself a favor and rent this sucker
<START> it's like this you put in the dvd and the most professional looking thing you see over the next ninety minutes is the logo of the distribution company and at this point you know you've just been jerked around br br people are generally trusting enough to assume that if something has been put on dvd it's going to be of a certain level at least financially if not creatively but sadly this isn't the case distribution companies are perfectly happy to throw together dvds of amateur movies and ship them right out into the stores to await the unsuspecting buyer who is drawn in by the well designed dvd cover the weight behind this particular project is most likely independent horror movie pioneer kevin j lindenmuth whose name may be known amongst genre fans since he's responsible for various other low budget werewolf movies rage of the werewolf werewolf tales and so on br br blood of the werewolf is made up of three short independent werewolf stories with no real connection other than the fact that they deal with hereditary shapeshifters the first segment blood reunion pretty much sets the tone for the whole thing a man returns to his home town to look up a girl who had a crush on only to find that her domineering grandmother refuses to let her have relationships with men and for reasons which are somehow related to a dark family secret this instalment is poorly directed poorly directed and basically nothing superior to what you could throw together yourself with a few friends and a home video camera br br the second story old blood is probably the strongest out of the three and is directed by lindenmuth himself it tells the story of a lesbian couple one of whom is a shapeshifter and the other wishes to be given this power her wish is granted but she doesn't become the creature that she envisioned this short movie shows that lindemuth has more talent and experience than the other filmmakers who worked on this project but still not enough to raise it above the level of an amateur movie br br and finally we have manbeast in which some army guy runs through the woods while being chased by two other fellas they wish to kill him as he has been bitten by the beast and is believed to be dangerous but all might not be as it seems this one has an interesting concept but it's stretched out to be far too long and if you don't guess what the twist is in the first ten minutes then you probably ain't too bright this pretty much sums up the problem with this whole dvd a few good ideas just aren't enough to justify spending money on something like this after all would you pay for a picture you could have painted yourself
<START> for this movie defines a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all c p must now be compared br br first off the beginning did have elements of style and if handled well could have become a cult classic a la pulp fiction or a desi desperado but the plot was there one begins to meander and at one point completely loses it br br throw in a deranged don with an obsession for english a call center smart alec a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb a levitating gravity defying hit man and a cop with a hundred or was it a thousand black cat commandos on their trail good ingredients in competent hands but this is where i would like to ask the director sir what were you smoking br br im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of bollywood film making for what must never be done insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers br br possibly the only redeeming feature in this desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music watch the videos hear the airplay and you wont be disappointed vishal shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes br br how i wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy br br as i sign off i want to really badly know how does akshay's bullet wound vanish in a microsecond what were you editors doing tashan maybe
<START> if you've read mother night and enjoyed it so much as i did that you just have to see the movie understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of vonngut's writing that beyond his story lies vonnegut himself and that you can't put a human mind on the screen his whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance i believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that vonnegut poses in his book but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen does this mean that the movie misses the mark of course not in my opinion the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page it succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of america's true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense i've seen other movie versions of vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel vonnegut's genius and loses grip on his own craft i would not place this movie as one of the best i've seen but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching by taking vonnegut's voice out of the movie's narration or trying to insert it however it can mother night tells his story brilliantly and preserves the story's fundamental lessons without confusion distraction or disappointment
<START> contains spoilers the movie plot can be summarized in a few sentences three guys go hunting in the forest two of them along other people get shot in the head without explanation the last guy can stand in the clear shout and do anything without getting shot he gets to walk through an old factory and has the evil people walk right into his scope without a struggle the villains are conveniently dressed in black and look like villains br br that is the whole story not summarized but in detail everything is drawn out with a guy standing ringing a door bell we wait with him long shot of guys being bored in the woods and sleeping we can take a nap with them the one drawn out shot of following a female jogger could have been redeeming if we could see her butt or boobs bouncing br br there dialog is less then terminator and it is not because there is so much action the characters just don't talk and then they don't even have something corny to say like 'i'll be back ' if my buddy shot this on the weekend i'd cheer for him because it is quite a feat to figure out the camera controls to pay money to rent this as a dvd is totally inappropriate br br the one thing that is a little funny is the extra with the director telling how they local police didn't realize that they were shooting and treated them like a random guy walking around with a gun if they'd have filmed that i'd be sure it would be more fun to watch then the movie
<START> i loved the movie but like everyone said there were some bits that weren't developed enough i thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison sure they were supposed to be innocent american girls but still i felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have for example in the montage where they're sight seeing the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward looking br br then there are some parts that were very ambiguous i think it's pretty much understood that danes' character didn't do it but i can see how that could be confusing also why did the camera dwell on manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk i thought it was suggesting something but it turned out to be nothing br br apart from that the movie was great i cried when claire danes took the blame she's a great actress br br also i wanted to see that bitchy thai inmate get her ass kicked talk about lack of closure
<START> this is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen unfortunately i am a horror movie buff and will rent any horror movie unless it's not made for t v when looking at the box it says it is rated r for gore and some language where was the gore was their one good death scene where you actually saw gore i could have overlooked that if there had been some brief nudity or some good dialogue there wasn't even one remotely witty or amusing line in this lame movie sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid but this was just sad
<START> i saw this movie sunday afternoon i absolutely loved this movie i loved everything about it from the sappy moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where mamie gummer lila is crying because of her poor decision in marrying a man for her parents and not because she is truly in love i loved these moments because they were just so real at first i was seriously scared because i was hoping that it would not end up like bobby which was a great cast but a poorly written movie with no real meat to it but during the middle of the movie i felt completely different you will laugh and you will cry but in the end you will want to see evening one more time trust me when i say go see it
<START> get ready for it this is one of my favourite films of all time i am relatively unaware of david mamet's writer and director other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times it's always a joy to watch i can say without hesitation that he is a genius this film is extremely well written and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit con artistry and back room hustles the feel of the film is very similar to the sting 1973 and it also pays homage to film noir br br it's quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters it is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch br br generally the acting is superb especially joe mantegna but someone who i watched the film with remarked to me that it's not a good idea to have a heroine lindsay crouse who is not only a gambler a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad 80's hairdo i agree but i think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role br br the less you know about the plot of this film the better just like mamet's most recent film the spanish prisoner because the ending will be even more impressive just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance
<START> hi folks br br forget about that movie john c should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits bon jovi has never been and will never be an actor and the fx are a joke br br the first vampires was good and it was the only vampires this thing here just wears the same name br br just a waste of time thinks br br jake scorpio
<START> this movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because jean claud vam damme stars in this movie there are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie br br the acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the 2 actors bill goldberg and michael jai white can not act at all and this movie by far has to be one of jean claud vam dammes worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch blood sport kickboxer or sudden death br br over all this movie is crap ok and my rating is 4 out of 10
<START> heartland was in production about the same time as michael cimino's heaven's gate heartland cost a fraction to make but is 10 times the piece of film br br heaven's gate was the biggest and most expensive 40 mil in 1980 hollywood flops of all time its failure resulted in the sale of the united artists studio to mgm imdb entry br br heartland cost a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from great writing direction photography and acting it easily draws you into the beauty joys hardships and sorrow of pioneer life br br it's sad that hollywood sometimes would pour millions into turkeys based on a director's single big hit and neglect such a wonderful story
<START> the movie wasn't all that great the book is better but the movie wasn't all that bad either it was interesting to say the least the plot had enough suspense to keep me watching although i wouldn't say i was actually interested in the movie itself janine turner and antonio sabato jr are both gorgeous enough to keep you watching they have a few cute scene's that should appeal to the romantic's overall i'd give the movie a 7 or 8 it wasn't bad just a little lacking plot wise
<START> it seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip basic instinct 2 to the point that a significant part of the audience including critics found it terrible even before it was released it seems even more fashionable to trash sharon stone whoÂlike all of usÂis now fourteen years older andÂunlike most of usÂstill looks wonderful first comments on this movie were so vicious that i had to see for myself in my opinion this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film but is not as bad as most comments pretend michael caton jones is not paul verhoeven neither henry bean and leora barish are joe eszterhas basic instinct 2 is just an entertaining average thriller and besides the addition of jerry goldsmith original score keeps little resemblance to its predecessor even stone gives her character a different dimension creating a lustful devilish catherine trimell who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like hannibal lecter she is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure unfortunately she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick she became too successful too much of a main icon and like all those actors who have reached that level her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by hollywood audiences br br the rest of the cast is outstanding giving performances that are far better than the material deserves david morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than michael douglas his acting is flawless giving a dense complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie he can keep your attention from beginning to end br br i am not recommending basic instinct 2 as a great movie i am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators
<START> cunningly interesting western from a director who had few peers in the genre much like other anthony mann pictures the far country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery both of which play out amongst some of mann's peccadilloes like honour integrity betrayal and of course death the story sees fortune hunting partners jeff webster james stewart and ben tatum walter brennan travel to oregon territory with a herd of cattle aware of the blossoming gold boom they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a klondike town arriving in skagway they find self appointed judge mr gannon john mcintire ready to meet out justice to webster on account of webster having fractured the law all be it with honest cause along the way in punishment gannon takes the partners herd from them but they steal them back and head across the canadian border to dawson with gannon and his men in hot pursuit here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involved br br interesting from start to finish the far country benefits greatly from james stewart's bubbling anti hero in waiting portrayal and mann's slick direction of the tight borden chase script the cinematography from william h daniels is superlative tho not done any favours by current dvd prints and the film has a few surprises and a will he wont he core reeling the viewers in paying dividends on re watches for hardened genre fans it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful yet dark western world of anthony mann and james stewart 8 10
<START> wisecracker the biography of actor william haines offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies the old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a los angeles museum screening of show people the late silent feature in which he co starred with marion davies beforehand haines was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter but he was pleasantly surprised and no doubt relieved at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it watch the film today and you can see why show people is a delightful hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair yet without malice it's still funny and its satirical points still resonate needless to say the technology of movie making has changed vastly since the silent days but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves haven't changed all that much br br show people also stands as the best surviving work of marion davies a first rate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes where her career was concerned davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour the newspaper magnate william randolph hearst it's well known that hearst exerted enormous influence over davies' choice of roles and well known too that despite her gift for comedy he preferred to see her play dignified heroines in period costume dramas by the late '20s for whatever reason marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies including the red mill and the patsy but show people directed by the great king vidor stands as her most enjoyable showcase william haines gives an engaging likable performance as her boyfriend and co star billy boone but this is the leading lady's show all the way br br marion plays southern belle peggy pepper an aspiring actress who storms hollywood accompanied by her father determined to become a movie star her dad colonel pepper is played by actor director dell henderson a veteran of griffith's biograph dramas whoÂcoincidentally Âresembled hearst one of marion's funniest bits often excerpted elsewhere is her audition at the comet studio casting office while dad helpfully suggests emotions to portray sorrow joy and drops a handkerchief across her face peggy assumes the appropriate expression and posture she's hired only to discover that comet makes low brow comedies the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue of course comet is intended as a take off of mack sennett's keystone but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds as peggy pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves comet for the more prestigious high art studio assuming the name patricia peppoire as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress at some point it may occur to us as it surely did to viewers in 1928 that davies' rival gloria swanson started out in keystone comedies before rising to prominence in serious dramas for cecil b demille and as miss peppoire takes herself more and more seriously giving the high hat treatment to former colleagues such as lowly comic billy boone davies' performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed squarely at swanson herself this is especially notable during an interview sequence when miss peppoire's spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spot on impersonation of swanson i suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof but i have to wonder how friendly relations were between gloria and marion after this movie was released br br in any event show people is a delicious treat for buffs who will relish the parade of star cameos throughout charlie chaplin contributes a nice bit sans makeup and looking quite distinguished eagerly seeking patricia peppoire's autograph and in a show of good sportsmanship marion davies herself puts in a self mocking cameo appearance evening the score for poking fun at swanson by poking fun at herself this is a silent film that viewers not especially attuned to silents might appreciate at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business show people surely belongs in the company of such classics as sunset boulevard and singin' in the rain among hollywood's most expertly produced enjoyable exercises in amused self examination
<START> tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in vietnam in 1971 br br at this point america knows they are fighting a loosing battle and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'tigerland' training camp in louisiana br br the film is more of a character study no real plot but it focuses on a key character roland boz who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man who only wants to escape the camp we are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold br br i'd have to say this is a great story about vietnam and more importantly about the army in general great acting and very memorable also the directors use of film and style works so well cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding vietnam its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle the particular scene where boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell and it's futility br br fantastic film not just about nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army' br br rating 9 out of 10
<START> this is one of the greatest films ever made it's an all time classic the character played by ned beatty undergoes one of the greatest on screen transformations ever portrayed he is a shallow almost useless overweight insurance salesman he is proud of his ignorance and yet judges the backwards hicks to be the ignorant ones when he compliments the old man on his hat and the old man responds you don't know nothing' the tone is set it's true he really doesn't know nothing' but one backwoods anal rape later the man is practically a warrior his shallow fake bravery is toned down into serious resolve the old self is forever dead left in some far off woods soon to be under hundreds of feet of water and what of lewis our intrepid guide lewis is a philosopher hunter warrior and he's just about nuts burt reynolds proved himself as an actor way back in 1972 in this film completely giving himself in to this wonderful role who wouldn't want to have a friend like lewis if one was to venture into the dangers of a forgotten soon to be left behind world like the one our hapless travelers find themselves in this film speaks to us on so many levels the story feels real it works as a complete action adventure with wonderful cinematography and deliberate grinding pacing it works as a bit of a horror film with the danger and almost surrealism of the encounter with the vile rednecks who objectify their sow ned beatty but it also works as an art film using incredible amounts of symbolism to convey truths that go to our very core i have seen this film at least fifty times and every time it comes on i find i have to watch it you have to watch it quite a few times to even begin to comprehend it this is one deep movie this is one well acted movie and this is one hell of a story i gave it a 10 out of 10 and put it in my 10 all time greatest films ever made along with schindler's list casablanca taxi driver and sling blade among others movies that make you think movies that take you beyond having to think movies that use a story to make their point without trying to preach to you if you think you know deliverance you might but again you might not it really is that good
