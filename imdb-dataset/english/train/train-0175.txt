<START> this wonderful 1983 bbc television production not a movie as others have written here of the classic love story jane eyre starring timothy dalton as rochester and zelah clarke as jane is the finest version that has been made to date since it is the most faithful to the novel by charlotte bronte in both concept and dialogue br br a classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons when film producers start to meddle with a classic's very lifeblood then that classic is destroyed thankfully the producers of this jane eyre approached the story with respect and faithfulness towards the original which results in a spectacularly addictive concoction that is worth viewing multiple times to enjoy its multi layers of sweetness and delight and suspense the performances are delightful the music is just right even the gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful and set the right tone for the production br br my only criticism though slight is that this version like every other version ever made of jane eyre ignores the christian influences that built jane's character and influenced her moral choices in today's modern world a woman in jane's situation wouldn't think twice but to stay with rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her oh just get a divorce she would say to her man or she would live in sin with him but jane eyre knew she couldn't settle for this course in life and respect herself why this decision was based on the foundations of the christian faith she had been taught since childhood not from the brutal calvinist lowood institution but from the christian example of a true friend helen burns who was martyred rather than not turn the other cheek someday i would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation a classic novel that ends with the heroine writing even so come lord jesus should not have the foundations of that faith stripped out of it
<START> i can see where the film makers were going with this but they never really reach their destination it's supposed to be a homage to spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame but unfortunately it fall short in its attempt it doesn't have that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for the characters are not vile and desperate enough like their italian western counterparts and failing these two points it lacks the humor of a successful parody in fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously unfortunately they also missed the humor mark by a mile a whole lotta bad movie
<START> how many times do we have to see bad horror movies with a killer in a scream ripoff mask the plot of bleed is kinda original but the movie itself is a complete failure for one thing the dialogue is poorly developed it's boring and wastes too much time on trivial details the acting is bad et cetera i want my money back this rental stinks worse than a skunk
<START> mulholland drive made me the definitive fan of david lynch he's a modern genius because he's not only a film maker his stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen so the straight story was quite a surprise to me with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets still lynch is there and while this is far from his best it's a film not to be missed late richard farnsworth's performance is one of the reasons br br 8 10
<START> 'grey gardens' 1975 is the maysles' brothers bizarre documentary of jackie bouvier kennedy onassis'eccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down 28 room mansion on east hampton long island 'big edie' bouvier beale 78 witty and dry and her daughter 'little edie' beale 56 emotionally about 13 a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future live in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic they amuse themselves by bickering all day listening to the radio or singing to each other they dont even own a television their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special although obviously dysfunctional people one of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today
<START> now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly i'm appalled for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then i'm afraid i don't know what the world has come to let me tell u something i started watching many t v shows like lost prison break dexter deadwood and even invasion but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season then we have the sopranos i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season and more importantly all of its episodes there is no department that this show doesn't excel in acting nothing short of superb james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it would've been the better choice however after watching the first few episodes i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony the raw emotion he displays is superb then we have everyone else edie falco michael imperioli lorraine bracco dominic chianese whom i remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part 2 and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie 'walnuts' gualtieri and silvio dante all of these actors perform to the best quality and all giving an excellent performance in each episode then we have the story never have i been so sucked into a t v show before the story is nothing short of excellent each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show not just say its too violent or they feel that the character of tony is immoral i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day i don't think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me you'll be hooked from the very first episode i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show hooked on it trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on t v after you've watched the first season you'll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates television and no t v show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos
<START> by 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it still instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it they went ahead and made it anyway apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible hell it worked for the wild bunch so why shouldn't it work here of course the wild bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of the last hard men is plain old fashioned rubbish br br it's hard to figure out what attracted charlton heston and james coburn to their respective roles heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw coburn the hunt becomes even more personal when heston's daughter barbara hershey is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation br br this is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over the top detail it's tremendously disappointing really because the star pairing sounds like a mouth watering prospect there's no sense of pace or urgency in the film either it takes an eternity to get going but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on nastiness all in all this might be the very worst film that heston ever made i'm sure it's one of the productions he is loathe to include on his illustrious cv
<START> wendy wu homecoming warrior has a very good strong plot but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie i am a younger teenager and didn't enjoy this movie very much i thought the effects were horrible but they might seem entertaining to younger children the matrix moves ruined the action you know that it was absolutely fake then there was the yen lo an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which wendy was striving to win it all ends like a typical feel good movie when wendy and her buddhist monk cousin shen defeat yen lo and destroy him forever in the end so wendy learns a lesson blah blah blah i'm ready for the next dcom
<START> the honey i shrunk the kids franchise was a huge deal and not to mention very famous i loved honey i shrunk the kids when i was little it was an original story and had such an exciting plot the sets were so amazing and the cast seemed like they enjoyed each other's company now honey i blew up the kid was pretty stupid so i think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved br br basically adam is a little more grown up now and the mom's are going on vacation to leave their husbands with their children but when wayne's favorite item is threatened for the garbage he wants to shrink it and keep it but he and his brother get in the way but when the wives come back after forgetting to give some meds to their son they get caught in the machine as well leaving the kids in the house alone br br the plot is silly but like i said it was just a family film that i think some might get a kick out of the original honey i shrunk the kids is the best i think everyone could agree the third one wasn't so bad i would recommend this one at least over honey i blew up the kid movie it was at least a little more fun br br 4 10
<START> i agree with one of the other comment writers about good story good actors but mismatched and i would also say rushed it has been about 24years since i read the book as it was in school but i felt that you would need to know the story of jane eyre when watching this one as bits are left out therefore it doesn't fully make sense for example jane mr rochester have hardly spoken suddenly he is proposing marriage the actors don't have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story the actors are good but aren't given enough time to do this story justice i'm sorry to say it but i didn't really enjoy this version the 1970 version with susanna york george c scott would be the jane eyre movie of my preference but you should check out the 1983 bbc mini series version with zelah clarke timothy dalton in the 2 main roles i love it so much i watch it regularly there is an abridged version which goes for 225mins or the full version for 330mins
<START> this picture for me scores very highly as it is a hugely enjoyable and amusing spoof of alien invaders taking over a town and many of its' men folk br br the town and the players are all decked out in sort of 1950's style and the whole movie has a deliberate tacky and kitschy feel to it some of the scenes are hilarious like with the birth of an alien creature br br all the actors give full blooded and serious performances which makes the film even funnier and the special effects and aliens are at least it seems to me intentionally 3rd rate to add to the amusement br br these type of films often deserve a cult following br br 8 10
<START> i was able to see this movie yesterday morning on a early viewing pass br br i am a mom of 2 children who range from 11 down to 6 so i'm sure plenty of parents can relate to having to see many many kids movies this was refreshing for me i haven't read this particular book so i don't know if it stayed true to the book or not but it sure took the grossness factor to a high level this is the story of the new kid in town and it just so happens that there are a group of boys who have formed a club of sorts and love to pick on kids sound familiar haven't we all suffered this one time or another he has the little brother who he cant stand and parents that he is embarrassed about what i enjoyed most of all was seeing how each character was totally different from another they all stood out the bully why do they always make the bully a red head my daughter has red hair and she is no bully lol is well a great bully who finds himself being yelled at by his own big brother it took twists and turns and well you fall in love with all of them and really find yourself routing for all the characters even the parents great connection between father and son all around enjoyable sweet funny gross etc take your kids you will enjoy it as much as they do
<START> in short the movie had a little bit of a weak 1st act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and pacing somewhat of a decent 2nd act that managed to build some tension and intrigue despite some inconsistent pacing and some inferior performances by the cast and the 3rd act there virtually wasn't any 3rd act br br regarding the 3rd act the movie just abruptly ends there is no resolution and no path down from the climax of the 2nd act so there wasn't much of a 3rd act the bad guys die and that's that the end credits roll there is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters and so on the audience would've likely left the theater after the movie asking that's it a real letdown br br music was composed by david bell which worked adequately enough to serve the film most of the time but it's certainly nothing outstanding it's just functional but achieves this by being merely generic and derivative it is also apparent that the score is very dated with the use of synthesized timpani for some of the percussion what least impressed me about the score is that some moments of tension heralds music cues sounding like they were ripped off of james horner from 48 hrs and commando particularly the brass br br in all the film had potential as the basic story itself is good but the execution was lackluster with mediocre direction weak acting and somewhat inconsistent pacing br br there was virtually no 3rd act to properly finish the story and this omission is major and unforgivable as it doesn't allow the movie to end satisfactorily this could either be the screenplay or possibly the production had to cut out filming or editing the 3rd act into the finished movie due to budget constraints but i'm speculating as to why there isn't a 3rd act whatever the reason the abrupt ending really hurts the movie overall br br this is good for a view if you're curious and you can get the movie for very cheap as well as to learn the reason why you need to have the 3 acts beginning middle end if you write screenplays and make movies br br otherwise you might not want to waste your time unless you can get the mst3k version to at least get some laughs out of it
<START> i want to add to the praise for the production of this film especially the luminous cinematography firelight glistening off of smooth and muscled skin creates stunningly beautiful imagery the film was nominated for and won a single oscar the first given for editing mala's performance is moody penetrating and powerful
<START> philip k dickian movie and a decent one for that matter better than the paycheck woo and that abomination called minority report spielberg but lets face it the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me half way through the movie i already started to fear about such kind of ending and i was regrettably right but that does not mean that the film is not worth its time no not at all first half as already many here have commented is awesome there are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future we will do such kind on corny sf things because we can or is it simply over combining but the paranoia is there and feeling out of joint also good one
<START> my husband and i enjoy the doodlebops as much as our 8 month old baby does we have bought him dvd's and cd's just so we can watch and listen to them ourselves they are fun energetic and very entertaining they encourage children to be active share and care they always have a positive message along with fun entertainment every time our son hears the theme song he quickly turns his head toward the television and starts bouncing up and down in excitement dee dee is a wonderful singer she has a great voice moe is a great dancer i would recommend the doodlebops to anyone with children our favorite song is the bird song you just can not help but smile and want to dance when you hear it
<START> fot the most part this movie feels like a made for tv effort the direction is ham fisted the acting with the exception of fred gwynne is overwrought and soapy denise crosby particularly delivers her lines like she's cold reading them off a cue card only one thing makes this film worth watching and that is once gage comes back from the semetary there is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason it is absolutely bone chilling this film only does one thing right but it knocks that one thing right out of the park worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so
<START> this film is really something of a curate's egg good in parts in contrast to other reviewers i found that the main fault with it is its inability to draw in the viewer's interest in the characters and the plot i sat through it because i'm interested in rock'n'roll and the dynamics of bands but if i were to evaluate it purely on the basis of its merit as a movie i would have to give it the thumbs down with a few caveats jason behr is good in the part of john livien and quite convincing as a rock singer the narrative regarding his childhood trauma is unclear although we are given hints in livien's well acted relationship to his parents but his behaviour is ultimately bizarre to the viewer which it shouldn't be nevertheless the idea of using a stage persona to solve inner conflicts is interesting albeit not novel nor fully explored as a theme in this film the allusions to john lennon were irritating but i confess i'm not a beatles fan at any rate livien and his band reminded me more of oasis than the beatles in the sense that there was something derivative about them another frustrating thing about the movie was the way it opened up with some interesting albeit middlebrow and high school level philosophical musings of the lead character but left the threads of his thinking there only to pick them up again in the middle of the film very briefly when livien says before god there was music ever seen that ad for tia maria in the 1990s before time there was tia maria that's what sprung to mind anyway it seems an idiotic conclusion and the viewer has no idea how he reached it but he's entitled to it fortunately his bassist and friend played ably by dominic monaghan seems to acknowledge the fallacy of this thinking when he responds you don't know that br br in all the limited strengths of the direction and the plot could go either way on future projects into pointless banality or into an interesting and more mature perspective
<START> decent enough with some stylish imagery however the tiny budget hampers things br br i also get the impression they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic weirdo perv website stuff br br if you like anime in particular stuff like cyber city and the ad police then this might up your street br br but basically its low budget matrix cash in however not totally devoid of its own style br br great soundtrack by some unheard of grunge punk post grunge bands worth checking out if only for the soundtrack
<START> this subject matter deserves a much better script and final result than this movie serves up the script is full of holes because it was never conceived as a story but rather a string of nightmare scenarios loosely knitted together the gaps and loose ends in the story line are numerous the scene where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead and have been looking for her since she was taken is just bizarre it is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head of the shelter for runaways handing her a missing poster from when she was eight in the real world if the head of a shelter for runaways found out that he had under his roof a solved kidnapping what would have followed would have been an immediate call to the police it's a law enforcement issue not a 12 minute segment for oprah everything that follows from there to the end is so short shrift that i can only conclude that the first 90 minutes was for pure gratuitous exploitation funny that's what this movie is supposed to be condemning in the end it seems to have joined in
