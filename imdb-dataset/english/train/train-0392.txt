<START> i sometimes enjoy really lousy movies those that occasionally result when people even talented people get together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster movies like attack of the killer tomatoes plan 9 from outer space manos hands of fate and heavens gate etc br br so when i heard that this movie rachel's attic was considered by many people to be the single worst film of the decade naturally i just had to see it br br boy do i regret that decision this movie is beyond bad it is so bad that it is not even as enjoyable as the usual bad movie the acting filming script etc are even worse than a low budget porno film the sound is utterly horrible the plot is completely incomprehensible the acting is laughable it is a complete waste of everyone's time and money at least the porno film has porno to break up the monotony while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy squeezing a rotten apple and a mad hatter's tea party br br the lighting is non existent many scenes take place in semi or complete darkness which is probably just as well the writer director i use the terms loosely david tybor tries to get kinky with bondage scenes but the results would be laughable if they weren't so pathetic there is some nudity but it is of such abysmal quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant i could go on forever and not do justice to all the flaws and shortcomings of this truly awful waste of film br br for the love of god avoid this train wreck i know that despite or perhaps because of my negative comments you may still be tempted to see if this piece of trash is really as bad as i claim it to be but trust me on this it's even worse than i have said and you will absolutely positively regret the experience and expense if you waste your money on a purchase or rental
<START> i rented the dubbed english version of lensman hoping that since it came from well known novels it would have some substance while there were hints of substance in the movie it mostly didn't rise above the level of kiddie cartoon maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book or it lost a lot in the dubbed version or maybe even the source novels were lightweight but for whatever reason there wasn't much there br br i noticed lots of details that were derivative sloppy poorly dramatized or otherwise deficient some examples the opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 star gate scene and the star wars image of hyperspace the robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized r2 d2 br br it starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of star wars but mercifully since the humor doesn't work gives up on comedy and plays it serious in that sense it's superior to the star wars franchise which started with a clever sense of humor and eventually deteriorated to jar jar's annoying silliness br br the agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm the harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field dumping silage onto unharvested crops rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto already harvested rows or into a truck corn maize was pouring out the grain chute but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field br br when it was time for kim's father had to face his fate there wasn't any dramatic weight to the scene that could have been partly the fault of the english language voice actor but the drawings didn't show much weight either kim's reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing br br similarly when a character named henderson was killed chris showed very little reaction even though they were apparently supposed to have been close henderson's death is no spoiler his name isn't revealed until his death scene she seems to promptly forget him someone's expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does i think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case there's at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of chris br br on several occasions villains fail to accomplish their orders a villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths i can't say whether that's lifted from star wars or if that comes from an earlier source possibly the lensman books br br there's a scene where a space ship crash lands as it plunges toward the ground parts are break off the ship but so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands br br while in most cases chris seems like a competent tough space hero there's a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress someone tough enough to get over henderson's death so quickly should at least be able to shout help it's got me and i can't reach my gun instead of just shrieking br br the character with the most personality almost too much at times is d j bill he sounded like wolfman jack the d j in american graffiti i wonder if he's as well voiced in the original language br br two planets in the movie exploded the explosions were unimpressive and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to star wars to its credit however the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the death star's primary weapon the dialog had a good interesting explanation for the cause many other explosions in the movie did look good just not the planetary explosions br br some of the sound effects are very cheesy as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game some of the images look like primitive video games and some influence from tron is visible too on the other hand the sound effects are often pretty decent although that emphasizes the cheesy sounding parts the art is good too particularly when it stays away from the often cheesy looking computer graphics br br finally there's the story if a movie tells a good story it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings but the plot here was pretty lightweight a naÃ¯ve boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship and acquires a great power he doesn't understand he and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful unredeemably evil enemy he makes friends learns about his special power and grows into a young man if he is persistent and virtuous enough he might even defeat the evil enemy details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline but there's very little more than that in this movie br br in the end it's just a kiddie cartoon but then since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children maybe it doesn't need to be anything more than that
<START> i've seen a lot of stupid plotlines in my time but this one is among the worst after catching some disease in space an astronaut comes back to earth and starts melting he then goes on a rampage killing people how is beyond me i just watch them i can't explain them this is the kind of movie that shouldn't have been made in the first place
<START> an itch in time' is one of a string of home runs bob clampett hit for wb in the early 1940s including horton hatches the egg' and tortoise wins by a hare ' soaked in manic timing and exaggerated mayhem it's basically the saga of a flea who's busy breaking ground for a new home and the dog whose ground is being broken because master elmer will give him a dreaded flea bath if he so much as scratches the unlucky canine is forced to endure an upward spiral of torment as the homesteading flea uses pick axes and power tools to clear the land ' ultimately the little monster lights the fuse to a small mountain of high explosives he's piled onto his victim's backside there's a tremendous explosion and the hapless pooch covers his eyes as his rear end erupts in a blazing fourth of july display that really has to hurt and the dog takes flight but soon he stops the action and says with a merry smile you guys better cut it out 'cause i think i'm starting to like it ' for years this kinky confession was censored but current prints have restored the clip so now viewers can enjoy it in its original devilish glory still cut however is the closing gag in which the cat blows his brains out after he laments now i've seen everything ' this was a common gag at wb but it has since been purged from this cartoon and several others including horton '
<START> the only thing that the first power really has going for it is that it affords jeff kober an opportunity to play one of his lovely variety of psychotic villains that he's done so well in the last 25 years kober is a worthy successor to lyle bettger who specialized in those parts back in the fifties br br but it's not enough the first power is a souped up slasher flick that has lou diamond phillips wasted as an lapd detective who has a specialty in catching serial killers kober is his latest catch but kober's in league with a lower power and they're going to team up and make lou's life miserable for him even after kober is given the gas chamber his spirit comes back in all kinds of guises br br mykelti williamson is on hand as lou's partner who meets a nasty end involving a demon possessed horse and tracy griffith as a psychic and elizabeth arlen as a nun with insights are around to help lou will he succeed in battling forces from beyond br br by the time the film ends you no longer care lou really got trapped in a turkey maybe the devil made him do this film
<START> it's curious that the two stars of meet the people were a pair of movie stars who went into the new medium of television and became even bigger successes and who both went into the production end of things and enjoyed tycoon status on the small screen lucille ball however was not a major star that would come with television as for dick powell he desperately wanted to get out of doing films like meet the people and his career salvation would be coming in his next film br br i think the only reason that dick powell did the film was because a young player from mgm was cast in a specialty number and he was seeing her at the time his private time with june allyson was far better than what we see on the screen powell looks crashingly bored and can't summon up any kind of emotion at all br br he was probably tired of doing these musicals with silly plots the kind he ran from warner brothers from the original show meet the people was not a book show it was a revue and it ran in the 1940 41 season on broadway for 160 performances when mgm bought it they scrapped everything but the title and the title song the rest of the score was patched together from various and sundry songwriters none of the songs is memorable odd when you consider some of the source material is from burton lane e y harburg harold arlen and rodgers hart these guys just must have emptied the trunk for material br br the plot is sillier than even most of the musical propaganda pieces of the time powell is the writer of a revue called meet the people and he's a shipyard worker who wins a lottery date with movie star lucille ball she's interested he's interested they're both interested in the revue but creative differences keep them apart of course until the finale that's the film in a nutshell br br mgm did give powell and ball some good musical acts which are the main reason for watching meet the people the big bands of vaughn monroe and spike jones are here and the highlight of the film for me is bert lahr dressed in a commodore's suit like lou costello had in the dream sequence in in the navy the song heave ho is written by arlen and harburg who wrote for lahr the courage number from the wizard of oz and as just about everyone in the world has seen that film you have an idea of heave ho is like br br dick powell's next film was murder my sweet in which he finally bid a not so fond adieu to musicals and lucy would have to wait for television before the world got to see what she really could do
<START> a series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day not as mind numbingly awful as say freddy got fingered or lost reality but that in no way is an endorsement in any way sense or form features the worst rhyming clown ever any most if it isn't offensive to anybody but the most prudish or politically correct it also has the worst song parody ever put on film the worst arnold impersonation ever not just the worst put on film literally the worst ever i have no clue why karen black micheal clarke duncan or slash would star in this the reasons i watched this in the first place the only thing mildly amusing was dickman in conclusion i would't recommend this film to anyone but the people who are making it their mission in life to get this in the bottom 250 on this site are pathetic do something notable with you lives people plus if it's true the church of scientalogy hates him he can't be all bad br br my grade d
<START> offside is the story of teenage girls who tried to sneak in the stadium to watch final world cup qualifying soccer match in tehran that may lead iran to the 2006 world cup in germany females are forbidden to go to stadium by law in iran although many of them dress like boys and sneak in stadium guards search every one at the entrance to make sure no one carries fireworks and of course no girl gets in br br like most of panahi's work his armature cast's performance was superb you actually think that you are watching a documentary the dialogs between the girls and the privates were executed delicately and astonishingly believable the film depicts the interactions between captives and the drafted guards who themselves are serving mandartory away from their family and friends in a funny sort of way at the end the audience realizes that there is not such a difference between the girls and the guards who were just following orders
<START> this is another example of a sucky sequel to a great movie i highly recommend the prophecy but this movie was a dud from the start the acting was decent all the way around but the story line was weak and added nothing to the origional a 4 out of 10 at best
<START> a truly muddled incomprehensible mess most things in the film look more or less like 1987 but then there are futuristic things just thrown in like the policeman's ray gun and that car the director seemed to be in love with colored lights the only really notable performance was the girl who played valerie but since there was no cast listing i don't know which actress that was this one is worth missing grade f
<START> i agree with other users comments in that the two main roles were well acted that being the guy that played gary gillmore and giovanni's role too bad the story was so boring not hearing about the story i knew nothing of gary gillmore before the movie so i didn't know what to expect i thought it would be something like dead man walking or the chamber but how wrong i was the whole movie was just talking talking and talking about their mom and dad the only cool scenes were the flashbacks where the dad would lose his temper that was the only interest i got from this borefest
<START> i have to be 100 honest with you fellow imdb users i wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster doesn't charlotte gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way i'm in love with that woman i got what i expected but only half this film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations br br while i don't agree with another fellow imdb user who states that the movie is overrated i must admit that prÃ©te moi ta main has plenty of flaws br br my main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters there isn't a single scene previous to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment of romance or even a clue to suggest that they're interested in each other br br in fact the only scene were both share a moment is tremendously awkward when both are in the couch and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest i didn't buy the dinner sequence br br still the movie delivers very funny moments and has a strong dialogs that support such an ingenuous premise i mean with ingenuous that it would be very difficult to execute such a farse by a 43 year old man in these days br br i understand it's a movie and that's why i accept it as a funny situation plus the humor is versatile there are moments involving s m funny lines with chabat's best friend some lesbian references funny situations involving the family women and more br br charlotte gaionsbourg's performance is top notch and she's by far the reason to watch the movie she's funny sexy looks very thin and fine and demonstrates she's a versatile and talented actress who can pull out a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance br br alain chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance i think the supporting cast do what they can br br the score art direction and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film br br those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits it's a good example of feel good cinema
<START> the acting in the film is really well done honestly but the movie is so slow and so boring as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt i am glad to see sam rockwell in this he did a great job so did the other actors as i mentioned but man this is one of the worst dragged out films i have ever seen now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good but other than that avoid it this film has so much filler it makes a twinkie cake jealous br br i never ever walk out on films but watching this one at home with family i walked out yeah it was that boring apparently my comment doesn't have enough lines to post so here's some more filler i guess i was inspired by the movie i just watched
<START> i have not read the novel though i understand that this is somewhat different from it the fact that i rather enjoyed this coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book having not read a single word of austen's writing i really can't compare this to any of her work what i can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever witty and well delivered as well as the biggest source of comedy in this this made me laugh out loud a lot with perfect british and verbal material every acting performance is spot on and paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker the characters are well written credible and consistent i did find a couple of them extremely irritating however and while i think that at least some of that was meant to be funny it tended to get repeated excessively and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared the editing and cinematography are marvelous and everything looks utterly gorgeous plot and pacing are great you're never bored it does end in a really obvious manner but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer i can't claim that this did not entertain me it did from start to finish and i'd watch it again there is brief language in this i recommend this to any fan of romance stories 7 10
<START> deanna durbin then 14 and just under contract to mgm made a short feature in 1936 which paired her with judy garland a year younger in the first film for both of them louis b mayer then decided he didn't need two competing young singers placed his bet on garland and let durbin go universal immediately signed durbin rushed her into three smart girls and rewrote the screenplay to pump up her part she's billed last but with the typographic equivalent of neon lights around her name universal was convinced durbin would be a smash and they were right three smart girls is less a musical and more a screwball comedy and durbin 15 when the movie was released carries it with aplomb she's penny craig and she and her older sisters joan and kay are determined to save their father who had divorced their mother from the clutches of an elegant gold digger with a fierce mother they talk their way from switzerland where they live to new york city where their father lives they plan not just to break up their father's wedding but to reunite their father with their mother who after ten years apart still loves the guy is there any doubt that durbin will sing a song or two in her warm luscious soprano nope is there any doubt the girls will succeed with kay and joan finding love and matrimonial material along the way nope again years later durbin was quoted as saying that she couldn't keep playing little miss fixit forever she was right of course but in three smart girls her first feature movie she has little miss fixit down pat durbin is funny determined resourceful energetic and of all things natural her personality is so genuine that it makes this comedy a mix of farce confusion good intentions and cheerful avarice downright endearing br br durbin carries the movie with ease it's a lot of fun watching her hold her own against the likes of binnie barnes as donna lyon the woman with her hooks in penny's rich father played by charles winninger who was no slouch at stealing scenes either alice brady who played the dithering matron in my man godfrey plays donna lyons' mother who is even more of a gold digger than her daughter the last of the accomplished farceurs is ray milland as lord michael stuart who through a contrived and amusing mix up is mistaken for mischa auer br br three smart girls holds up well as a light weight and amusing comedy of manners and mix ups so does deanna durbin as a brand new star who with her huge success saved universal's bacon
<START> i have to admit i did not finish this movie because it was so amazingly stupid and not worth watching i watched it with a room full of kids who also were not laughing at the stupid and crude humor the director bob dolman seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitalia that it overrides the real story that i grew up with this is not a good film for kids besides the fact that the content is so crude the movie is just stupid has bad flow and has no intelligence behind it what a waste of a perfectly good story if you read the book when you were younger and loved it then don't waste your time watching a movie that so badly botches it that it makes you angry buy your kids the book instead
<START> the first half was ok but the last half really really disappointed it's funny the producers even admitted they didn't have a clue for the ending and it really showed whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this i really didn't want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn't really worth that effort when battlestar galatica first came out i was really excited with the prospect of a better remake it didn't happen that first season border on being space porn they eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama so i started watching again but to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel same with baltar and six was pretty dumb
<START> this movie is an exact copy of a tv series on indian television channel doordarshan which was aired at least 15 years ago the series was known as gubbarre meaning balloons each episode was a new short story the story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and convincing abhay doel does a good job but he doesn't fit the role of a normal and third class guys as he calls himself in the movie in fact shayan munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the abhays role but shayan just doesn't have the talent to pull it off br br i would suggest watching the series if it is available it is the same story except for the running around with the friends mother and the initial introduction the acting of the tv actors was much better than these stars br br the only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour or 45 minutes story to 2 hours so it has to get draggy even the nasal singing sensations songs could not make up br br this movies is good for a lazy sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven't watched the original tv serial the script and the ending of the serial was much better br br spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead the ending of the original serial was much stronger as the hero himself dumps the girl even thought she is willing to marry him he is aware and tell her that he doesn't want to be repayed and never helped with that intention the director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film the original ending would have bought tears to the girls eyes and would have had the guys nodding in agreement the deliver just wasn't right br br but personally i feel this is a pathetic copy no credit should be given to the director scriptwriter the story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of premchand munshi i am not sure if this is premchand munshi's story but many of the other short stories int he series feature a few of premchand munshi's and other great hindi writers stories
<START> the 1963 version of the haunting has been one of my favorite horror films for years so i anticipated the release of this 1999 remake with a good deal of trepidation it hardly seemed that any follow up could exceed or even equal the original masterpiece unfortunately my worries were well founded this movie stinks br br i don't know what the people involved in this film were thinking jan de bont who seemed to have had a fluke when he directed the excellent speed does as poorly here or perhaps even worse as he did with the much hyped duds twister and speed 2 cruise control hey jan stick to cinematography would ya liam neeson is adequate in his role as the doctor pretending to be a sleep psychologist i don't think he is capable of turning in a truly bad performance but even he cannot save a lame script and weak story catherine zeta jones proves once again as she did in entrapment that she lacks the acting ability to rise above the material that is handed to her the female lead who did great in an episode of the x files looks lost here as eleanor an insomniac hovering on the edge of sanity and that blond guy whoever he is is more wooden than the laughably strange statuettes of children carved into the woodwork around the house i don't think he changes expression once during the entire film br br spoilers ahead br br the reason the first movie worked so well is because we were never sure whether the house was truly haunted or whether the manifestations were a result of eleanor's precarious mental state no spirits are actually seen in the original leaving much up to the imagination a hallmark of other great horror films like the changeling and the blair witch project in this updated version we of course get tons of cgi ghosts which basically in the face of the weak script plot make the movie totally unscary the f x aren't even that great considering they were done by ilm the frozen breath looks particularly fake the effects in the underrated peter jackson film the frighteners which i saw just before this one were a lot better the wooden carvings of the children which are supposed to look creepy just look silly especially when they scream and the cgi monsters are nothing to write home about rather than providing a relief from the bad acting bad direction and bad writing the effects only add to this mess of a film br br some particularly dumb scenes when the three other characters break into eleanor's bedroom and none of them seem at all surprised to find a huge scowling demon hovering over the bed the scene where eleanor sees the former lady of the house hanging from the rafters the acting here is particularly bad and last but not least the unintentionally hilarious bit where wooden blond guy utters an uninspired shout of what is supposed to be anguish leaps up on a piece of furniture and starts slashing away at the painting of the old evil guy who built the house we actually get some satisfaction in this scene as seconds after his attack blond guy is dragged over to the fireplace by the ghost of the old guy and promptly gets his head cut off by the flue it was the only part of the movie i enjoyed br br in sum stick to the original 1963 the haunting 3 10 stars
