<START> i honestly have to say that i could not stop watching this movie from the second that it started simply for how bad it was it's kinda like watching paint dry only a lot more confusing i mean you sit there and just wait for something to happen anything in fact preferably something that makes the whole film make sense at the end of the film i actually sat there wondering if there was any chance at all that i may have missed the first hour that explained everything or whether i may have inadvertently passed out during the film and missed the parts that glued the plot if there was in fact one together the main thing that really confused me about this movie is nearly at the end the main girl if there was indeed a main girl was in some sort of alternate reality i mean what the hell was going on at this point all of a sudden she awoke and was in a mental institute chained to a bed being drugged by doctors or something then quicker than it would have taken me to slit my wrists it flipped back and she was getting eaten out by some random vampire it made no sodding sense i'm tempted to email the makers and demand my time back i mean i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this rubbish i am kinda interested to know if the filmmakers themselves actually knew what it was all about just seemed someone had edited out all the bits that could have made it make sense though i think the film would have had to have been 4hrs long to make that happen i side completely with the other person who wrote the other review i was duped royally with this film by its title and that alone i'm just so sodding grateful i didn't actually buy the film no matter how many times iv seen it in the local pound shop you would have thought that would have given me a clue that the film was a complete pile of steaming movie rubbish but to be honest i think Â£1 was way too much money to spend on this film what a sodding huge waste of time and a good razor blade i mean i wish i od'ed its less painful than watching this film
<START> a simple movie in the beginning a simple movie in the end it does have that un ending and pretending cliche but most tv movies have that any ways br br christopher reeve does a good job as being an ex con drifter the marriage between her and the woman he works for i feel is a bit queer but i believe for the time period it is set in that it is believable none the less br br now i saw the edited 'tv' version even tho the movie was made and showed on 'tv' i find that a bit queer as well but i feel if i saw the entirety of the piece i would give it more in likely the same rating br br j t walsh does a nice job not his best role but still a nice job br br 7 10
<START> i grew up in southern west virginia i'm about the same age as or maybe a year older than homer hickam author of the rocket boys the book forming the true story basis of this heart warming film br br and so i relate closely to the west virginia coal mining theme and to the stunning effect sputnik had at that time october 4 1957 on all of us the rocket boys went on to make great lives for themselves i went on to get my degrees in physics and computer engineering all because sputnik woke up a lot of young people to the science gap the u s s r had on the u s in those cold war days br br this is a wonderful film for everyone of all ages but if you grew up in west virginia in the late 1950's it'll touch the core of your being br br everyone get it watch it recommend it to your friends who'll thank you many times
<START> i think this film has been somewhat overrated here there are some things to admire in it for one thing it deserves credit for being a science fiction ish film which relies on its story instead of special effects and action sequences to carry the day the supporting cast is good the set design and cinematography are good and the ideas are interesting enough though they are beginning to seem a little tired after the many mediocre dark city memento fight club clones of recent years but the film is undone by poor characterization wooden performances from the lead actors and a laughably bad ending br br the main problem i had was that the protagonist was neither likable nor unlikable i realize that part of the story dictates that he should be a bit of a wait for it cipher but i was utterly unable to work up any empathy for a character that just seemed like a boring anonymous schlub of a man what character transformation there is for this sad sack is artificially forced on him by the plot lead actor jeremy northam succeeds in conveying that the protagonist is confused and hapless but fails at inspiring any sympathy for him opposite him lucy liu does what she can with a character who has no real personality of her own unless being the embodiment of a spy movie clichÃ© counts as personality br br one of the biggest disappointments of this movie is the ending i won't give any spoilers here but i will say that a surprise twist at the end was telegraphed pretty clearly at least 45 minutes before it occurred further after being content to be a quirky idea oriented movie for the first hour or so the last few scenes suddenly and terribly devolve into the worst kind of hollywood pap complete with big explosions and special effects the revealing of the film's mcguffin at the end is poorly done and at the end the characters seem even less likable than they did before some of the film's main plot threads were resolved br br the movie's not all bad though it does manage to maintain a certain low level of tension throughout most of it despite the slow pacing although i think i have a higher than average tolerance for slow paced movies and there are some moments when the unsettled paranoiac feeling that director vincenzo natali was clearly trying to evoke rises to the surface but in the end these elements aren't enough to overcome the flaws in the film's acting and script there is probably a good movie that covers these same themes and ideas but this isn't it
<START> what is most disturbing about this film is not that school killing sprees like the one depicted actually happen but that the truth is they are carried out by teenagers like cal and andre normal kids with normal families by using a hand held camera technique a la blair witch ben coccio succeeds in bringing us into the lives of two friends who have some issues with high school although we aren't ever told exactly what is behind those issues they seem to be typical a lot of people hate high school so what a part of you just doesn't believe they will ever carry out the very well thought out massacre on zero day the surveillance camera scenes in the school during the shooting are made all the more powerful for that reason you can't believe it's really happening and that it's really happened the hand held camera technique also creates the illusion that this is not a scripted movie a brilliant idea given the subject matter
<START> sometimes i just want to laugh don't you no analyzing no critiquing and no looking for deeper meaning rent this movie watch it all and laugh your ass off don't want to admit you liked it fine but don't trash it here when you and i both know you liked it it's damn funny
<START> karen goes into a japanese house as a substitute nurse to emma a strange woman who sleeps at day and wakes at night karen goes upstairs after hearing noises when she encounters a frightening ghost she will learn the house's secrets br br it is very scary the scenes are shocking and frightening the characters are good the settings are creepy i love the whole plot the ending was shocking i paused at a scene where the little boy meowed so loudly to the man finding his sister upstairs and i was shocked this is the scariest movie i have watched i did not see the japanese version i recommend this to horror fans 10 10 and 5 stars
<START> well what can i say other than these people are super in every way i quite like sharon mcreedy i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the boxed set of 9 discs 30 episodes i did not realise that they had made so many i also think that it is a great shame that they have not made any more i wish that i got given these powers imagine me being knocked off my cycle somewhere and being knocked out cold then waking up in a special hospital later on i discover that my body has been enhanced just like richard barrat these stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way you cannot fight these 3 people as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry the music is well written and to me puts a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats improved sight improved hearing and touch and the strength of 10 men for richard and craig and the strength of 3 women for sharon who i thought was beautiful and intelligent when i was a boy i had a huge crush on her now i can see why on my dvd set the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series i also thought that trymane was a good boss firm but he got things done
<START> because of all the negative reviews of this film i almost didn't watch it however i was pleasantly surprised that it was a fairly enjoyable horror movie the acting wasn't great apart from the wonderful alice krige but some of the dialogue just consider yourself lunch was quite amusing br br on the whole an above average stephen king effort 7 10
<START> this is by far the worst horror thriller i've seen in my 29 years if someone offers this to you for free tell them no this movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it the plot isn't even the worst part of this movie its the acting camera work lighting and sound there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie whoever paid to have this film made is broke now i hope the director never gets the greenlight for another movie in its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual btk killer's capture but i've seen movie of the weeks that looked like oscar winners compared to this
<START> well well well as good as john carpenter's season 1 outing in masters of horror was this is the complete opposite he certainly proved he was still a master of horror with cigarette burns but pro life is perhaps the worst i have seen from him br br it's stupid totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays it's welcome despite the less than an hour running time the script is nonsense the characters are irritable and un appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd br br and for those suckers who actually bought the dvd one of them being me did you see how carpenter describes the film he's actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time and he praises the script and in the commentary track where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut he just says he didn't feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there i fear the old master has completely lost his touch i sincerely hope i'm proved wrong br br i want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome though technically speaking this film is top notch with effective lighting schemes and make up effects
<START> someday somebody is going to write an essay comparing paul naschy's fury of the wolfman to the great spanish surrealist films l'age d'or and un chien andelou the naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end dali and bunuel probably loved it and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull off br br the film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from a to b to c some mishmash about a professor walterman his first name mind you who was bitten by a yeti monster during an expedition to tibet and hasn't been the same since which is understandable one of his jealous colleagues the insane daughter of the noted doctor wolfstein knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him but its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beast br br walterman flips out turns into a werewolf kills a few people is electrocuted dies is buried unburied taken to a castle filled with circus freaks wired to various machines zapped with assorted electronic effects injected with potent elixirs is chained up turns into a werewolf a woman in an evening gown with thigh high nazi fetish boots whips him he escapes helps the pretty female doctor find her way out of the castle fends off the circus freaks with a battle axe eventually turns back into a werewolf and has to fight to the death against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife the lady with the nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her luger pistol they die together and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the studly reporter who did nothing look what a beautiful day it is br br la furia del hombre lobo was written by paul naschy in a hurry original director enrique eguilez was fired and replaced by josÃ© marÃ­a zabalza a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production he was often unable to work though he did find time to instruct his 14 year old nephew to make some alterations to the script and naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of naschy's previous movies mark of the wolfman the scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different and helped pad out the runtime after zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie post production was a nightmare nobody knew who was doing the editing the money ran out the master print disappeared for a while and then at a pre release screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater he was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curb br br yet somehow the film works if you let it it keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles vaulted catacombs chains whips gloomy moors fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesn't make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution in one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning in the next shot its bone dry and he's howling at the full moon then its raining again and yet you don't look at it as a gaffe its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible opposites are the same and effects proceed causes first the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams and then the cable starts sparking with electricity people say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness i say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend it is a marvel of making something out of nothing and succeeds not because of what it could of had but because of what it does it's easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it the trick is being able to see through the mayhem or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effect br br paul naschy died last week at the age of 75 he had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more was working on film projects right up until his last days but passed away in madrid spain with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment his rich varied and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest and yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like fury of the wolfman in rapt awe even people who don't like euro horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at if only for just a minute in a couple spots you can find it for free at archive org or even buy it on a dvd for a nickel it's worth far far more br br amusingly naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted sick demented little movie as a classic if not an outright masterpiece of cinema dementia the problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for naschy to forgive i would never presume to dare to forgive it for him but i will say this i'd rather watch fury of the wolfman in its dingiest most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing obnoxious crap churning out up at the swine flu cineplexes this or any other weekend br br the world lost a great artist this month watch his films and remember br br 9 10
<START> i'm a big fan of camp but when every plot 'twist' is predictable and bad while obviously not trying to be even i lose interest i was going to rate this a 3 but the ending dropped it a point easily its only saving grace is that i hated other movies more not enough beer in the world for this one
<START> this was the first of panahi's films that i have seen i saw it at melbourne film festival i was totally absorbed by the different characters that he creates and how differently they react and behave compared to aussie kids and yet on other levels how similarly i think perhaps if more people could see movies like this they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be fueled by the fear of the unknown there are the obvious large political differences between oz culture and iranian culture but i found the more subtle differences between the characters that this film fleshes out so successfully on screen extremely fascinating there are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem to me so unique i found it made the characters compelling viewing
<START> did heidijean really see this movie a great christmas movie not even close dull bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with maybe i'm expecting too much for a lifetime movie played 15 days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie
<START> joseph l mankiewicz's sleuth didn't need a remake it's a thoroughly well made film that stands up well to this day however given that the modern day remake machine is currently in full swing i really can't say i'm surprised to see the film updated for modern audience the plot remains identical to the original film and at its core we have the story of a young man milo tindle who goes off to see an older man andrew wyke to discuss a divorce as the younger man is having an affair with the older man's wife from there a game of cat and mouse ensues its clear right from the outset that director kenneth branagh wanted to add a different touch to this film and he does so by way of the central location which has been changed from the charming games ridden country house of the original to a technical marvel kitted out with layers of security equipment i'm glad that the director chose to make this change as nobody wants to see a remake that directly copies of the original plus there's the fact that the location is well used and always nice to look at unfortunately however the positive elements of sleuth 2007 end there br br the original film was over two hours long while this remake is only just a shade over eighty minutes naturally therefore that means that this version has less about it and unfortunately it's the characters that suffer the plot is also rushed and we get into the first twist in the tale far too quickly and before we are given any chance to actually understand why and how these events can be taking place the film does not build the characters or the rapport between them enough to make sure that their relationship makes sense one major thing that has been changed about the older character is his obsession in the original he was obsessed with games which turned out to be very important once the twists come into play here he has some kind of security fetish that doesn't really mean anything by the end kenneth branagh's handling of the film allows for a classy score but the class ends there the original thrived on it but this film is happy merely to soil itself with expletives on numerous and mostly unwarranted occasions which cheapen the whole thing the final twist in the tale is completely different to how it was in the original and ensures that the film boils down to a really hideous conclusion after spending two hours with the original i understood respected and liked both characters presented in the film after eighty minutes of this i hated them both i do have some respect for branagh for not merely rolling out a carbon copy of the original film but this is not a good adaptation of the great anthony shaffer play
<START> they're showing this on some off network it's well crap while it is not as bad as the b movies they show on the sci fi network on saturdays but still a fairly large pile of crap the acting is passable the plot and writing are fairly sub standard and the pacing is entirely too slow every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where they're wrapping things up before the credits not the peak of the movie the denouement also large portions of the cast look way to old for the age range they're playing the whole thing is predictable boring and not worthy of being watched save your time it's not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free
<START> oh my god the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old the plot the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace br br i am not usually this critical about any movie cause every person has his her style but this movie however was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008 i can honestly believe that this movie is unknown and i think it should stay like this for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke br br i advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies or even simply movies to stay far away from this one
<START> the horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn gothic flicks each night from 10pm till about 4 in the morning but their 'scare' factor is very limited if one exists at all in fact i am sure i will find a multi million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer br br the bloodsucker leads the dance deserves special mention because it is i feel the undisputed low of a channel full of lows i cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is but for the purpose of completing the minimum 10 lines demanded by this site i will at least give it a go br br firstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen in fact the film might as well have been called 'toothbrush' or 'wallpaper' for all it has to do with the plot at least they used toothbrushes at least they had wallpaper br br there are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances not one i'm sure they were making two different films by mistake here br br a more suitable title would have been 'horny italian count leads five people to a scary castle and bores us silly for ninety minutes ' yes that fits better br br the acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling and that guy who plays seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character abysmal br br the only saving graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off bonus br br otherwise steer a wide birth away from this one no vampires no dancing no scenes of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on gods earth i will ever ever ever watch this one again br br no word of a lie this film could put you off motion pictures for life
<START> it utterly defeats me why godard is taken so seriously and one plus one is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an 'intellectual' polemicist it's hard to credit that godard actually believed all that marxist and maoist kant anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as godard was making his films supporting them as a filmmaker ask yourself would you have boring voice overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience and then when you couldn't think of anything else to do layer another voice over to the first voice over which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case brilliant jean luc as for godard insisting on making a film with the rolling stones of course he did wouldn't you it was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place the genius of the stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera the bookshop scene wasn't worthy of even the worst fringe theatre and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it as could be readily seen copping out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film making is no more than a safe get out to offer those who clearly see godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience ironic that godard's one time great friend truffaut with nuit americain made the best film about film making ever and godard made the worst with le mepris incidentally godard didn't choose the stones' track of sympathy with the devil it just happened to be the track they were working on when the 'film' started shooting at barnes olympic studios
