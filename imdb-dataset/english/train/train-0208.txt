<START> i can watch a good gory film now and then i've seen some pretty sick stuff however this is one of the few films that i found to be grotesque in a way that was just plain repulsive and revolting i like gore films when they are fun i like wen they are a lot of creativity behind them the gore in this film is not creative it is sick it is repugnant it is completely unpleasant because of this this film is certainly not entertaining the film is a horror film but it lacks scares so pretty much the only reason why one would watch this film is for the gore but that is the most unappealing and ugly aspect of the whole film and that's saying a lot the acting is terrible the plot makes no sense and the music is really annoying and way too electronic sounding it all took me right out of the film pretty much the whole film is one big long depressing ordeal there's this guy that has a freak accident in a shuttle and awakens in a hospital to find that his skin is dissolving and melting off i guess that after that he goes out and eats human flesh in order to slow down the melting process there's some weird subplot involving an old couple getting chased by a dog some dismembered head floating down a stream and an ending involving a man being electrocuted there were times where i tried really hard to enjoy it but the only scene in the whole film that i thought was even entertaining was the scene early on in which a nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion if you like ugly nasty ad unappealing horror films this one is for you
<START> scott bartlett's 'offon' is nine minutes of pure craziness it is a full frontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsy inducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avante garde cinema there's no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature Â particularly the human face and form Â to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highly industrial form of modern technology in a sense the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools his machinery his technology this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubrick's '2001 a space odyssey 1968 ' and indeed bartlett's opening sequence of images Â flashing colours before a close up human eye Â recalls dave bowman's journey through the stargate the visuals are richly coloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasingly grainy video as though we're sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact the end product was recorded from a tv monitor br br there appears to be some confusion about the film's release date imdb lists the film as a 1972 release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film's completion and its first public screening either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video and some brisk techno music wouldn't have gone amiss either 'offon' captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information i had a thought Â and please don't laugh at this free thinking interpretation Â that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth's television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguely familiar imagery that couldn't possibly make any coherent sense perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality
<START> convoluted infuriating and implausible fay grim is hard to sit through but parker posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it she's at once touching funny cunning the supporting actors commit to it as well br br i wont even try to tell you the plot it involves characters from hartley's henry fool and attempts a tale of international espionage br br the film works well if you continue along with it understanding it is in a sense completely ridiculous it becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod along i resisted the temptation to turn off the dvd twice br br fay grim requires an adventurous film goer willing to tackle something that isn't cookie cutter in the end it offers something that defies description
<START> women have never looked so attractive and pathetic as in salazar's film piedras although editor's cut here and there might help the film it is exciting and enjoyable with an intense mark from pedro almodovar's latest films 5 different women are coping with their male partners and families beginning with several different stories bound to meet as the plot goes on salazar portraits his women characters in the same neurotic and border line behaviour familiar to almodovar a kleptomaniac high society lady with a fattish to smaller shoes a burlesque house madam taking care of her disabled daughter a drug addict dancer obsessed with her former boyfriend and a taxi driver taking care of her late husband's disturbed kids all roaming the streets of madrid in well designed scenes using some of almodovar's familiar actresses the director succeeds in it's first film to give depth to all the characters sharing the film and to create genuine sympathy with each of them the women controls the plot line and the men are bound to be left with each other eventually surprisingly good for a first film and worth the time in any standard it is noticeable that salazar hesitated in some needed guidelines to the actresses but an impressible act is shown anyway on the screen especially by monica cervera which played in his former short film br br a must to all almodovar's fans and enjoyable to all
<START> the decoy is one of those independent productions made by obvious newcomers but it doesn't have all the usual flaws that sink most such films it has a definite story it has adequate acting the photography is very good the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men and the background music isn't overdone this is a dvd new release so people will be looking here to see if it's worthwhile i don't know where all the 10's come from as there's no way this film is that good even if you're the filmmaker's mother br br the last film we saw at a theater was warner's trashing of j k rawlings much loved and excellent book order of the phoenix in comparing the decoy with phoenix consider that phoenix as made by warners had no story certainly no acting was allowed by the director the photography was dreadful and the wall of sound overbearing musical score was just a mess i rated phoenix a 1 because the scale doesn't go any lower the decoy is 4 times better in all regards br br if you have the opportunity give the decoy a chance remember this isn't decoy 3 the shootout or any such nonsense it's original if your expectations aren't overblown by the foolish 10 scores here you might just enjoy the film on its own terms
<START> this documentary explores a story covered in pilger's latest book freedom next time which was published in 2006 it reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of diego garcia one of the chagos islands in the indian ocean br br the islanders are technically british citizens as diego garcia is a british colony much like mauritius the nearby island to where the natives were exiled used to be but the british government has ignored their pleas to return to their homeland as the island is now a military base for the united states army who have used it as a basis for the bombing of iraq and afghanistan br br as usual pilger's coverage is shocking especially as he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders his interviews all round are excellent and his cornering of a parliament representative where he uses the government's own information to pin him down ranks as one of his best br br pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the british conspiracy to evict the natives the weaving of this footage with the interviews and the islanders music really heightens the film's impact br br it is not easy viewing but stealing a nation is john pilger at his best recommended
<START> star pickford and director tourneur along with his two favorite cameramen and assistant clarence brown doing the editing bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor isolated scottish islanders the same territory that michael powell would stake twenty years later for his first great success visions of wind and wave sunbacked silhouettes of lovers do not merely complement the story they are the story of struggle against hardship br br the actors bring the dignity of proud people to their roles and pickford is brilliant as her character struggles with her duties as head of the clan wavering between comedy and thoughtfulness here with her father's bullwhip lashing wayward islanders to church there seated with her guest's walking stick in her hand like a scepter discussing her lover played by matt moore br br see if you can pick out future star leatrice joy in the ensemble i tried but failed
<START> for months preceding the release of this movie you saw it advertised in all sorts of print media so i patiently waited for its video release to see what all the hype was about after it was over i had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the vcr for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie it essentially fails because it is a character based movie about unredeemable characters with the possible exception of amanda peet whose only redeemable quality is that she is amanda peet you cannot stand any of them the film relies on its dialogue which is sophomoric moronic and crude the only slightly amusing character is eric whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on the final twist designed to make you laugh at the three main characters only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards peet all in all only rent if you are desperate or possess a dark sense of humor
<START> i watched this movie yesterday and was highly disappointed br br heather graham and tom cavanaugh basically had to carry this awkwardly unbelievable script for five hours or however long it actually was from the beginning every single element of this movie is unbelievable this movie made me chuckle several times but they were mainly out of shock that the director writer actually expected us to believe the many messy scattered elements that attempted to piece this movie together br br the movie's focus is gray graham and her issues with intimacy things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly way too much in common br br interesting intriguing however instead of unraveling this story into something believable and palatable the director keeps taking gray into these ludicrous twists that never actually make any sense at all being an lgbt individual this movie seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we go through in the coming out process i'll be insulted if the writer's queer had it not been for the cute chemistry between cavanaugh and graham which by the way was understandably forced i would give it a negative 3 stars
<START> dan katzir has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a roller coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern israel br br for anyone who's ever been in love the film brings back the uncertainties the insecurities and heartache that make love so bitter sweet the atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling instantly you are drawn in to dan's plight and you can't fail to be deeply moved br br you can't write drama and passion like this the contrast between the realities of dan's desperate snatched relationship with iris and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently watchable if you have an ounce of passion and have ever been in love see this film
<START> after a lively if predictable opening bank heist scene 'set it off' plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink this is a movie that deals in nasty threadbare stereotypes instead of characters preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought wit or feeling in short it's no different from 90 of hollywood product but it's the racial angle that makes 'set it off' a particularly saddening example of contemporary film making posing as a celebration of 'sistahood' the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating afican american 'gangsta' stereotype the gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all african americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the man it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else worse 'set it off' exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure serious race related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery then they're ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished the lapd turns out to be a bunch of caring guilt ridden liberals tell that to rodney king and aspirational 'good' sista jada pinkett smith follows the path of upward mobility out of the 'hood and into a world of middle class self indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank manager boyfriend 'set it off' illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the 'hood while all the time despising it while the likes of 'shaft' and 'superfly' in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well worn plots they had a freshness an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch 'set it off' wouldn't be worth getting angry over if wasn't a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of african american film making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s
<START> in addition to his tarzan series the prolific edgar rice burroughs did write many other books although aside from the popular at the earth's core few of these have been filmed one exception is the novel entitled the lad and the lion brought to the screen as the lion man 1936 an over talkative static old hat slow moving and rather dull movie despite being filmed on real desert locations actually movie is the wrong word the narrative doesn't move but proceeds at a snail's pace in an abrupt series of jerks for instance at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear even more frustrating for the keen movie fan are the characters who make an impression of sorts like the lass who plies hall with drugged wine but are enacted by players who are not credited the credited thespians generally come off worse than the unknowns one exception is australian actress finis barton who gives a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who rescues young master fairy admittedly most of the cast are saddled with atrocious king james dialogue which has to be heard to be believed but the way to play this rubbish is tongue in cheek a stratagem which does not seem to have occurred to a single one of the film's roster of no talent players maybe director j p mccarthy scotched that idea anyway it's sad to see the lovely kathleen burke forced to trade lines with the likes of richard carlyle her dad and jon hall her suitor admittedly mr hall delivers his lines with marginally more conviction than mr carlyle but that is no recommendation
<START> other commentators have detailed the plot and the social parables and commentary as well or better that i could but i would like to join in my admiration for this little jewel of a film it holds up very well indeed more that 50 years later in every category screenplay acting photography set design sound design it really is a classic of sorts this was my first exposure to the young alec guinness and it's obvious from the first frames what made him so special as to eventually receive a knighthood br br i only rate it an 8 because it's essentially a rather lightweight parable that examines human nature but doesn't really skewer it and because the plot takes the easy way out at the end rather than actually resolving conflict between the inventor and the mill workers and industrialists who are chasing him all over town also a couple minutes of thought reveals the basic flaw in the logic of the screenplay wear and tear is hardly ever the determining factor in buying new clothes especially dress clothes children grow up people change sizes gain and lose weight and go with the latest fashions all the time and have as long as looms have woven cloth and if nothing else the manufacturer would make a fortune providing indestructible material for military uniforms especially bdus br br still this is a great film if you get a chance to see it on a classic movie channel you should
<START> of all the british imperialist movies like four feathers charge of the light brigade for example this movie stands out as the cream of the crop it reflects a time when the sun never set on the british empire get over it i won't go into why because so many others have expressed the many reasons that makes this film great i have visited the alabama hills and have photographed the pass through which the british marched and it remains as it was unchanged by time and encroachment by man and vandals and even though i know it's coming seeing din lying dead on a stretcher and when these lines are read br br yes din din din br br you lazarushian leather gunga din br br though i've belted you and flayed you br br by the livin' gawd that made you br br you're a better man than i am gunga din br br i still at 54 years of age get misty eyed and anyone who says they don't is a liar the range of emotions within it is the mark of a great movie like the ending of another great film of mice and men
<START> saw this movie at the vancouver film festival and thought it was deadly smart stylish and funny br br the cast was rock solid great work by carrie anne moss dylan baker tim blake nelson billy connelly and up and comer alexia fast br br weirdly i found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it br br writers dennis heaton robert chomiak and andrew currie layered in a lot of political subtext but didn't whack you over the head with it br br the world they created had depth and made sense there is a giddy carnivorous spirit to this movie br br fido is guaranteed to cure grumpiness br br loved it
<START> why br br that simple question had to be on the lips of every single new yorker during the 12 months of terror that david berkowitz created in 1976 77 that same one word will surely become the same perplexing question 22 summers later as people exit theaters exhibiting the trite and exploitative summer of sam br br director spike lee attempts to weave the story of a pack of misguided thugs searching for the celebrated psychopath who paralyzed new york city for over a year with a stark and graphical depiction of the killings the demons inside berkowitz's head and the frustration of a futile nypd manhunt he presents an ensemble of despicable losers who hear their own barking dogs as they live lives devoid of love honor and humanity no different than berkowitz lee browbeats the audience in nearly every frame with not one of us are what we seem to be often a critic of the white establishment lee perpetuates the stereotype by including a scene where mira sorvino playing a newlywed with a cheating husband john leguizamo hopes to have oral sex with a black man in the back of a big black cadillac an italian mafioso tells a black detective that the famous willie mays' over the back center field catch was lucky lee even makes sure to deliver the racist musings of one middle aged black woman who declares i'm happy it's a white man killing all these white people because if it were a black man killing all these white people there would be the biggest race riot in nyc history br br other than an outstanding opening pan shot of an arrival at a disco reminiscent of shots from martin scorcese's goodfellas or orson welles' the third man this film has no soul purpose or passion he parades characters on the screen bereft of human decency although we learn nothing about the true victims of this horrible spree spike lee seems to be saying new york city got what it deserved during that frightening boiling summer over two decades ago br br how could anyone wreak such havoc on his beloved city how could someone show such hatred toward his fellow man br br are these appropriate questions for berkowitz or lee br br you decide
<START> i missed the beginning but i did see most of it a friend got it on dvd in the cheap room at fye br br the skits are all very short and yet most of them are still too long the majority of them they seem to have forgotten to have something funny quite a lot of racist sexist homophobic humor in it skits based on stereotypes or skits which use racist terms for people br br i'm trying to remember anything i thought was funny in it and i'm having trouble the logo for the tunnel vision network is a lipsticked mouth with an eyeball in it the mouth opens and closes over the eye like eyelids kind of creepy br br what a disappointment most of the actors went on to better things and it's lucky this bomb didn't hold them back
<START> films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning while there are some exceptions the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes the kids in paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds as they're both very annoying and they don't have an ounce of acting ability between them in short they're rubbish this isn't good considering that they're the leads and it especially isn't good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors it's a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn't not completely it follows a young girl who after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created it soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings and so sets about making various changes until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare oh dear br br as you can see this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie however it is squandered through a number of fatal faults first and foremost in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness the movie is extremely stale the central plot is hardly played with at all and the result is an entirely boring experience the lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don't care any more which is due to a lack of ideas thanks in part to it's lead characters the film feels like a kids movie throughout this is to be expected as it stars kids but bernard rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story as the horror in the movie is laughable at best the film is also very cheesy and the 'romance' between the two leads is extremely cringe worthy and makes for very painful viewing in fact if i had to sum this travesty up in one word i would choose 'painful' paperhouse is poorly acted laughably plotted very corny and dull on the whole save yourself the pain see something else
<START> this is a complex film that explores the effects of fordist and taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations there are constant references to assembly line production where workers are treated as cogs in a machine overseen by managers wielding clipboards controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed and firing workers stanley who meet all criteria as his supervisor says are always on time are hard workers do good work but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake br br this system destroys families stanley has to send his father to a nursing home where he quickly dies after stanley loses his job iris' daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant references are made to the fact that now with declining wages both partners need to work the implication being that there's nobody left at home to care for the kids iris' husband is dead from an illness and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care iris' brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift and or teeth job even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them the one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail presumably he's also black and black men suffer disproportionally high incarceration rates she remarks that he like her is doing time her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slave br br stanley however still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of fordist capitalism he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father's traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract as iris' brother in law does suggesting that he married the wrong sister he does not as iris says conform to the work eat sleep routine of everyone else rather he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way in a sort of bauhaus ideal this was the dream of early modernists and 1920's socialists such as the bauhaus to use technology to provide for all basic needs allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations he is also outside of traditional gender relations he cooks he cleans he cares for his family and he knows how to iron iris on the other hand lives in a traditionally male role she's a factory worker the mains source of income for her extended family and she brings stanley into the public realm traditionally off limits to women by teaching him to read and write she gives him access to the world of knowledge also traditionally gendered male br br literacy here is used as a metaphor for the traditionally masculine public realm and the systems of circulation monetary vehicular cultural that enable participation in the public realm without this access stanley is feminized the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning he is excluded from all regular circulations unable to participate in the monetary can't open a bank account in the vehicular can't get a driver's license can't ride the bus and in the social he asks if he exists if he can't write his name br br after learning to read he grabs books on auto repair farming and spirituality the bible the word of god is therefore relativized placed on the same value plane as how to books in fact organized religion in general is only very occasionally present the bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find stanley and iris having sex it is however acknowledged as a moral force iris clearly a character devoted to living a good life mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatching br br once able to read he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan a car and a house taking his place at the head of the family the breadwinner presumably he's an industrial designer dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce this ending probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film is so incongruous with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it wasn't forced in by some studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feel good ending and its potential effect on the bottom line br br now that according to the pundits we've comfortably moved on to post industrial capitalism the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period br br nevertheless it's highly recommended at least if you want to exercise your brain disregard the ending and it's close to a perfect 10
<START> for a while i was caught in the trap where i found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that i liked them fatty drives the bus is the exception it is the truth it is the best bad movie ever br br the badness of this movie seems to come naturally halfway through satan's opening monologue the word hell appears at the bottom of the screen the glamorous bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a thrift store dress it takes the eccentric couple that keeps trying to kill each other forever to walk down the stairs jesus walks to a funk soundtrack br br anyways fatty gives the impression that someone lost their tenure for advising a senior's film project but it's the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful you get the impression the makers knew it was going to be bad but never forced it br br never to be duplicated in wonder fatty delivers highly highly recommended
