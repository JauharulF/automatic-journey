<START> an end of an era was released here in the states in spring 2002 with the rookie a disney live action film that seemed to be the best for last it took place right here in texas actually the story began in west texas as evidenced by an area code found on a sign over there it was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high class baseball team that he decided to go professional br br what i liked about this movie it was sooo nice it was a very good sports movie ala the mighty ducks trilogy it had also taken moviegoers across texas from somewhere between the panhandle and el paso all the way to the metroplex where i live i can tell because i recognize that ballpark was the ballpark in arlington now it's ameriquest field it was nice to see disney's golden age end here in my area br br r i p br br golden age of disney br br 1920s spring 2002 br br it all started with a mouse and it ended with baseball sobs br br 10 10
<START> why do they insist on making re makes of great movies like high noon from here to eternity and this one br br why do they think that color is more engrossing to a viewer than stark black and white br br why did robert's insist on wearing that dopey broad billed baseball cap it made him look like jim varney br br why would anyone spend four hours suffering through this br br watch the original then you won't have to ask yourself why
<START> i caught this on showtime tonight and was amazed by how a movie with such a interesting premise could wind up being so unbelievably awful who's your daddy stars brandon davis as an adopted high school senior chris hughes a geek who inherits the heir to a porn empire left to him by his biological parents though the premise sounds like the movie could be a lot of fun it is ruined by inept directing from first time director andy fickman a clichÃ©d and predictable screenplay and acting that is even bad by direct to video standards even the normally funny charlie talbert turns in a surprisingly dismal performance as the best friend ali landry is the only good part of this lame and unfunny dud 1 10
<START> when i saw the previews for this movie i didn't expect much to begin with around a second rate teen horror movie but wow this movie was absolutely awful and that's being generous br br first of all the casting for the movie was terrible you feel no sympathy or for that matter any morbid feeling for the characters the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the god awful thing to end br br secondly there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever can somebody please explain to me why the girlish looking boy starts screaming pancakes at the top of his lungs while going into jackie chan moves i've never seen before and even further biting the guy who has the virus why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus infected guy and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud where the hell did that come from br br i just simply couldn't believe what i had seen i really thought i had seen some bad movies but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all this movie made me want to puke and then puke again then blow my brains out br br please save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive watching grass grow perhaps is a proper alternative
<START> where can i begin i heard this movie was coming out and i was very mad i am a huge fan of the original carlito's way and when i heard about this i thought it would be just like almost all the other sequels that come out in hollywood i thought it would be bad boy was i wrong this movie was much worse than i expected not saying all sequels are bad but thats the problem with hollywood these days they make too many sequels and remakes and rush them this was not a theater release it is a dvd release still in my opinion there was no reason at all for this to be made after i heard about this film was in progress i then later heard pacino was not in it that right away killed any chance this movie had of being good why did i check this movie out then some of you may ask well i had the opportunity to see it so i did i don't only watch movies that i have high expectations of i had low expectations on this one obviously i just wanted to see if it would have anything relevant in it now if any of you reading this are a carlito's way fan you know a lot of the story in the first one has to do with him going to jail br br very minor spoiler i wont ruin anything because this may actually make you not want to waste 2 hours watching this trash all i will say is in the end of carlito's way 2 we don't see carlito go to jail now i don't know about any of you but i would have thought a prequel to carlitos way would show how he ended up in jail i even had some interest in actually seeing what happened br br now thats not my only problem with the film the actor who played carlito did not do too bad a job but he could not have saved this film if he tried there's not even all those little things that should be thrown in there that carlito's way fans would like you don't see any appearance of kleinfeld or other key characters in the first one i would have liked to see something like that what is even worse is luis guzman is in this film yet he doesn't play the same character he plays in the first film big mistake on their part why cast the same actor for a different character it made the movie worse than it already was br br bottom line i am a carlito's way fan this new straight to dvd release is a disgrace if you are a fan don't watch this movie coming in with high expectations this movie did basically nothing for me and it is definitely one movie i wont be picking up on dvd or watching ever again
<START> this is a most handsome film the color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in brilliant color other indoor scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant as for the music what more can be said other than that lanza's voice was at its' peak as he sang so many of the worlds' best known and beloved arias the marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony of course hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of caruso there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events for example the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth there are some very good web sites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several pictures of him these web sites can be located by using any good search engine there are also several books available concerning his life history but the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film the voices of lanza kirsten and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie enjoy i know that i sure did
<START> a very silly movie this starts with a soft porn sequence ventures into farcelike comedy in the art gallery adds a shocker of a discovery in the hotel room then introduces a random murder for no obvious reason br br what follows is bizarre and surreal the stopwatch scene in particular is exquisitely unnecessary culminating in a revelatory twist ending which is as obvious as it is unfair on the viewer see the trivia section for precisely why it's deliberately unfair br br the movie goes out of its way to be offensive to as many groups as possible transsexuals the insane and the wonderful huggie bear style racial stereotyping on the subway and condescendingly treats the viewer like an idiot in the closing scenes as characters endlessly explain to one another in great detail and over and over again what just happened in the film though the background female characters in the restaurant scene at the end are a joy to watch br br in fact the whole movie is a joy to watch despite its many many flaws the whole package just well works
<START> excellent movie albeit slightly predictable i have to comment on nicole kidmans acting in this movie some of her other works haven't shown the amazing talent this woman has but birthday girl doesn't suffer from this in the slightest even without words kidmans acting shines through
<START> sunday july 16 8 00pm the castro san francisco br br as a southern colonel your make up is very indiana br br the yammering gossips of hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in marion davies direction over the years that she had fame handed to her and was undeserving is often speculated considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into this criticism would seem to have some validity as a comedienne however her star shone very brightly left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled mabel normand one of her better outings was king vidor's show people 1928 which survives and is so well known largely because mgm filled it with star cameos this happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars davies and that notorious joe college wise cracker william haines rumor has it show people was loosely based on the life of gloria swanson who began in sennett comedies and rose to grand drama and don't think she didn't spend the rest of her life reminding everyone with von stroheim walsh and demille coincidentally the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs keystone had abandoned the year before think of who worked there br br colonel marmaduke oldfish pepper dell henderson drives his daughter peggy davies from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies these two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible billy boone haines Â a custard pie artist Â who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance watch for the bit with the noodle and then helps peggy land a part in his next picture what she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball but a job is a job and billy convinces her all the stars have to take it on the chin Â at the preview billy and peggy bump into Â charlie chaplin who asks for her autograph she pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified billy grabs the book and makes her sign chaplin climbs in his car and billy tells peggy who shes just snubbed so naturally she faints it's so very funny considering davies character isn't supposed to recognize this guy peggy soon moves on to work at the high art studios changes her name to 'patricia pepoire' and leaves poor billy behind davies does a wonderful send up of a serious actress with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips vidor throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot and they're all sitting shoulder to shoulder facing the camera that includes polly moran who's also sensationally funny playing davies' maid louella parsons one of the friendly vampires estelle taylor claire windsor aileen pringle the comedy duo of karl dane with his arm in a sling and george k arthur pretending he's stealing the silverware leatrice joy amused by arthur's antics renee adoree rod eating and smoking la rocque mae murray john in a robe gilbert who also appears driving through the mgm gates early in the picture norma eeeww talmadge looking bitchy and aloof as usual and patricia dressed like marie antoinette sandwiched between douglas fairbanks as he does an amusing trick and william s hart protecting her from doug billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming with predictably nutty results vidor even works himself into the final scene as the director of peggy's current production also worth noting are harry gribbon as the comedy director doing a great caricature of eddie sedgwick sidney bracy as the dramatic director who can't get peggy to cry for her screen test and then can't stop her once she does and paul ralli as andre her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony when her character tries to 'act' its as though davies is poking fun at all the awful dramas she'd been forced into and she's brilliant doing it br br while it's true show people is a hokey satire of the 'good ole days' ten years hence it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from mgm irving thalberg and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent what a shame so much has been lost there are also far too many examples of great films like the patsy 1928 vidor and davies' hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year languishing in vaults when they could be seen and enjoyed
<START> perspective is a good thing since the release of star wars episode i the phantom menace claims and counter claims of just how episode's ii and iii will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' star wars films making them part of a cohesive whole rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies what the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films this new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy return of the jedi often derided for its overly 'cute' factor rotj is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect the empire strikes back indeed the 'cute' element of rotj namely the ewoks remains a weak link in the entire series did george lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities only he can answer that question br br this cute factor aside the film is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga following on from the conclusion of the empire strikes back luke skywalker mark hamill follows his rebel alliance friends to tatooine his home planet to rescue han solo harrison ford the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba the hutt for overdue debts br br skywalker is a changed man since leaving tatooine with ben 'obi wan' kenobi alec guiness to fight the evil empire now swathed all in black luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn his psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest while he might aim to always assist his rebel friends he yearns for another chance to confront the evil darth vader again despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the dark side and join vader at the emperor's side br br early scenes in tatooine are impressive from jabba's lair to his floating palace and the 'almighty sarlac' an intenstine that lives in the sand lucas' cgi enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the sarlac making it look fake and overdone br br the battle scene on tatooine is outstanding and is one of the more memorable of the saga luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates jabba and his cronies proving his prowess as a jedi is now almost complete br br when luke returns to the degobah system to visit the ailing yoda one more time the viewer is let down by yoda's distinct lack of screentime undoubtably the star of the empire strikes back yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of luke's destiny is played out on screen br br rotj really is luke's film perhaps even more so than the original his journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with darth vader and his fate the other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow the romance between leia carrie fisher and solo is all but non existant unlike in empire in fact only leia's character is developed in rotj solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films br br their roles are consigned to working alongside the rebels to destroy an all new death star that nears completion this time the emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction the empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all while the emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful skywalker to his side to work alongside or is that replace darth vader the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film less cunning than governor tarkin peter cushing from star wars more deeply psychologically dark than anything else played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate br br all the other actors are well entrenched in their roles hamill surprises as the more wisened luke making his character's progression from whiny teenager impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series ford's role is waring thin as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films he was the real star of the first film after all fisher's leia is more of a prop at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about add in favourites like alec guiness as kenobi yoda and the loveable chewbacca c 3po and r2d2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast br br despite the film's corny forest battle involving the ewoks and the empire it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence on endor in space and on the death star each with very impressive special effects the music as always is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance just as the 'blue danube' worked perfectly for 2001 a space odyssey john williams' score is as much a part of star wars folklore as light sabers and the force br br lucas left the ending open to interpretation meaning there could have been more episodes made indeed sci fi fans have created their own versions of episodes vii viii and ix in their heads over and over again rotj works when given a chance and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series br br when all six episodes get to be viewed together this saga could well be the best ever made is it already the addition of episode i changed the landscape of the series this is why return of the jedi can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release
<START> i saw this movie years ago and i was impressed but then again i was only 12 years old i recently re watched it and want that time back this film is pretty bad while i like lee majors chris makepeace watch my bodyguard 1980 if you would like to see a good movie that he was in of meatballs also starring bill murray for some laughs and burgess meredith this role does did nothing for their careers br br anyway lee majors character franklyn hart is an ex race car driver who plans on driving his race car which he had in storage across the country to california one problem the government has outlawed all private transportation i thought the concept was ok not the worse i've heard of but the execution failed horribly
<START> i rented this one to see vanesa talor one more time she can act but doesn't get a chance in this clunker the opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes must have come from a stock archive because the movie is shot direct to videotape the production values make blair witch look professional there's a really cheesy animated statue but no other effects worth noting this movie is bad but not amusingly so the players would do well not to mention it on their resumes
<START> the film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour it starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good funny story is to come well i can tell you it will not come it will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness br br in an interview i heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that according to him the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience i was amazed to hear that am i living in the same world he lives in ok a lot of people do walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all but that doesn't make me feel like i am losing my identity what does khrzhanosvky think that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch am i shortsighted or is he br br well my vote the good start of the movie saves it from getting a 1 a decent 4 is my conclusion
<START> this is a really well made movie sumitra bhave has always made sensible cinema and this is my favourite film by her this movie should have won the national award and would have been my pick to represent india at the oscars it is at least a thousand times better than 'shaaws' which is going to the oscars from india this year br br it is such a pity that the information about this and all other indian movies on imdb is lacking and sometimes even wrong sadashiv amrapurkar played a very important character in this movie and he is not even credited on these pages the rest of the cast and crew too are not mentioned at all awards and nominations for this movie are not given even when sonali kulkarni won the indian national award for this movie there was not even a single vote cast for 'doghi' br br 'doghi' is not a hindi movie it is marathi and thankfully escapes the song and dance sequence does not get tangled up in glitzy glamour and half witted designer ware it is a real life soulful story that is made with a rare understanding and respect br br 'doghi' which can roughly be translated as 'two women' is a story of two sisters gauri and krishna it is actually a very simple story sumitra bhave does not venture into many sub plots and that makes it a very difficult film to direct the entire movie is set in a non descript remote village in maharashtra and the screen rarely ventures far from the house of the two female protagonists no aesthetic sunsets in this one br br the movie opens and we are introduced to the entire house which is preparing for gauri's wedding gauri and krishna's father being a hard working farmer the house is full and happy there is nothing wanting in their simple lives however on the eve of the wedding gauri's to be husband meets with a fatal accident gauri's father cannot bear the tragic news and suffers a major stroke without a strong working member the house could have fallen apart but gauri's mother shoulders the responsibility she works as and when she can but cannot make ends meet but her life still is easier than gauri's superstitions that people half heartedly try to forget make gauri an evil luck bringer she is outcast from the society br br gauri's mother writes to her brother desperate for help she accepts his suggestion he takes gauri off to mumbai where she is made to work in brothels gauri sends home the money she earns and their conditions improve gauri gives her life for that of her family's br br however when gauri returns home for krishna's wedding her mother does not come out to meet her she does not allow krishna near her and does not allow gauri in front of the guests she loves gauri but fears for krishna's life this breaks gauri completely and she decides to return to her unfortunate life but krishna runs out and holds gauri she begs her beloved sister to return krishna promises to stand by her promises that they would face the world Â together br br there is nothing that is not required in this movie everything is necessary and sufficient gauri goes off to mumbai but what she does there is never told Â the subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know it just the bare story which is profound in its simplicity br br 'doghi' is responsible cinema it is respectful to the subject it handles it is respectful towards its audience Â it does not think them to have the mental capability of a four year old br br the acting is first rate the direction is marvelous Â the silences carry the story forward in a way no words could have the script is well researched br br anyone who appreciates good cinema is bound to like 'doghi'

<START> this movie is one of the masterpieces from mr antonioni it is about youth distraction happiness alienation materialism honor corruption and it is like everything else from great italian director true art br br
<START> i agree with the last reviewer that this movie had terrible acting yes there was a lot of gore and some nudity but it was overshadowed by a slow moving meaningless plot and dumb ending where was this supposed to be filmed anyway a canadian chinatown or hong kong hostel was a much better movie and i would recommend seeing that instead a technical annoyance i had with the dvd is that if you shut off the spanish subtitles they return after a few scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again also don't waste your time on the deleted scenes because there's no audio and it just looks like tourist footage
<START> every now and then a film maker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you inside to see the things that make us human lawrence kasden done this again i always felt thebg cill was the anthem of it's age and he has managed to do it again in grand canyon every so often we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it this is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice the juxtaposing of little and big events that lets us see how basically trivial most things we worry about are is truly genius i have watched this film a number of times and am constanly surprised at how deep the emotions run through this film danny glover and kevin kline do their roles with great tenderness and stever martins portrayal of a movie exec is priceless thank you again mr kasden
<START> mark hamill should have felt mighty embarrassed with corvette summer this time he uses a new kind of force to regain the possession of his dream machine a bright red 'vette it looks like another sour teen age flick the first half hour and does a u turn in heading for the wrong direction the writing and directing jobs are dreadfully done with a few scenes you can't hardly take you're expecting this to happen anyway and you're also sniffing the smell of late 70s hodgepodge only a former newcomer like annie potts would easily steal the show and save this poor movie from the repo creeps her impractical but delightful personality holds on to your interest for good and this is the finest chance to see her in a swimsuit hooray for annie sorry mark i guess the force wasn't with you this time around
<START> minor spoilers br br well i just sat up late and watched this film mainly because i enjoyed and rated some of singleton's earlier work like boyz n the hood however i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived clichÃ©d so called message movies br br the acting is mainly poor pop stars and models do not necessarily make good actors take note the situations hard to swallow rape victim becomes overnight lesbian please but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of by the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its one dimensional players br br not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural sexual and political ignorance as a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems it's message is contradictory resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion as for the films conclusion i found it predictable embarrassing exploitative and mildly offensive for a film called higher learning i have to say all i learned is to avoid seeing this ever again br br if you want a true comment on some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire american history x unless you were just watching it for tyra banks then go hire a life
