<START> this was a very good film i didn't go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the acting the script and the scenery miranda richardson was fantastic and so was joan plowright they stole the show but the other actors played their parts wonderfully also very enjoyable film
<START> i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i'm well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective programmes with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this
<START> a warning to you not to be seduced by the names bigelow and red undertow is pointless and unengaging and made me think often of a phrase by twain about wishing all the characters would be drowned together when someone brings up the category of worst films ever made it's not the likes of plan 9 or attack of the killer shrews that i think of it's the likes of this what a complete waste of time my own and everyone who was involved with this flick
<START> 2005 toronto film festival report it is official takashi miike is whacked br br the annual midnight screening of the new takashi miike film the big spook war or the great yokai war or yÃ´kai daisensÃ´ call it what you will this is a fanatical ride br br colin geddes the fearless programmer stated this film was originally geared towards children in japan think of lord of the rings or neverending story for japan after the screening i can understand where they were going with that but damn this is takashi miike after all he directed the '01 film ichi the killer when it screening at the festival barf bags were handed out at the screening and no that wasn't just a marketing ploy br br plot summary a young boy with a troubled home life becomes chosen and he stumbles into the middle of a great spirit war where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions through his journey br br this is not really for kids well not 'too' young certainly see them getting scared shitless with some of these spirits even the friendly ones on display this is unlike anything i've seen in the movie theater before a fantasy naturally some very funny but dark material you will not be bored can guarantee that will this ever hit north america doubtful br br my rating b
<START> every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror diamonds are crafted and one becomes completely awestruck by its sheer brilliance this is no less than a diamond this is a film brimful of eeriness chilling anticipation and dark atmosphere and i think it's safe to say one of my favourite horror films of all time and of course it contains probably the single most flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror every time i see the film and it gets up to the point where you know the inevitably will happen i try to remember exactly when i will be frightened out of my wits but it never fails to happen i never get it right and i find myself as terrorized as the first time i saw it now it must be said to scare a jaded horror fan like that that is nothing short of pure perfection unlike the americans the brits know their subtleties they take pride in the art of acting they do not need any special effect in order to convey atmosphere they rely on the power of the potent story and the creepiness in this case of suggestion and anticipation every single element is impeccable from the set pieces the acting the story to the menacing atmosphere pauline moran surely could make the devil whimper that's for sure as an end note if you for some demented reason don't like this piece of insanity then you honestly don't know what horror is all about and frankly do not deserve to know it either thank you
<START> now i like sci fi cartoons however when robotboy appeared in canada in late 2006 i watched the premiere and was inevitably appalled the characters are generic and stereotypical do they really need to make an african american man wear tiger stripe print clothing and speak in a jamacian accent why are all the asian characters vibrant yellow and squinting does the mother have to have big thighs and chest and constantly complain to the point where things become unrealistic predictable gross and sometimes disturbing there are heavy similarities to even stabs at astro boy allow me to explain dub names for the young robotboy astro kamikaze tenma constantine shadow gus abercrombie tommy alejo lola zoran kennedy moshimo o'shay and it so on brief resemblances to my life as a teenage robot star wars teenage mutant ninja turtles kamen riders sailor moon and co are afoot not to mention the abundant racial gender stereotyping don't even get me started on the innuendos i'll just say they're hidden and quite dirty but seriously don't even try watching this especially if you like astro boy
<START> chris kattan is a great sketch actor on saturday night live but he should probably leave the movie industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control he plays an annoyingly peppy character who basically comes off as mildly retarded and on speed wanna know the only funny parts the stuff they showed in the previews yes his rendition of take on me is funny nothing else is especially when you can tell he's trying very hard to be a physical comedian which he shouldn't have to try at because he is one and yet his 'demolishing the vet's office' bit comes off as cringingly bad this movie made me develop an eye twitch avoid it at all costs and keep watching snl
<START> what an appalling film don't get me wrong gene hackman and denzel washington are good actors but aside from a few interesting set pieces the film is mostly taken up with hysterical submariners shouting crying sweating and generally freaking out when anything goes wrong br br take that with simplistic asides to make sure the audience still understand what's going on the scene where denzel washington explains to a radio repairman how he must be like scotty in star trek is nothing more than a joke and you have a dumbed down thriller not worthy of the acting br br let us just hope that the real nuclear us navy is not in the hands of such a script br br
<START> let's see here are the highlights of the brain machine 15 establishing shots of a pool and a house 15 establishing shots of a nondescript office building 5 countdowns by a bland technician 7 close ups of a menacing guard and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a high tech experiment br br various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the release date given on the dvd box of 1977 that's an easy one to explain this dog simply sat on the shelf unreleased for five years until someone dusted it off thinking it fit in perfectly with the post watergate mood of distrust in government after seeing the brain machine now my only wonder is that it ever got released at all
<START> look this is quite possibly one of the best movies america has to offer the rest of the world to hate this movie is to hate freedom itself i remember that the early 80's were a time of uncertainty the economy was weak communism threatened us all and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty out of that confusion came a hero stroker ace ned beatty's performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness his triumph is an inspiration to all the on screen chemistry between burt and loni draws obvious comparisons to brad and jennifer jim nabors is a poet go see this movie tonight
<START> i was rooting for this film as it's a remake of a 1970s children's tv series escape into night which though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd fascinating and disturbing the acting in paperhouse is wooden unintentionally a joke the overdubs didn't add tension they only reinforced that i was sat watching a botch casting exasperated the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth chemistry or conviction as in most lacklustre films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be comforted consoled and reassured that they will not be held responsible out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen lamer than i could have dreamt br br escape into night deserves a proper remake written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind
<START> my spouse i found this movie to be very schlocky it started out good but quickly got unbelievable ridiculous most of the acting was poor with the exception of the little girl abbie who really was terrific in addition the dialog was predictable lame especially gideon the angel's also without giving away anything when one of the characters has a tragedy she almost appears nonchalant at first we thought it was 'shock' but then we realized that it was just a terrible script we love almost all of the hallmark movies their heart warming stories but this movie doesn't rise to the occasion of being one there are so many great ones don't waste your time with this horrible movie
<START> i have to admit that i liked the first half of sleepers it looked good the acting was even better the story of childhood pain and revenge was interesting and moving a superior hollywood film but no one mentioned this so far at least in the latest 20 comments when it came to the courtroom scenes and brat pittÂ´s character followed his plan to rescue his two friends who are rightly accused of murder i felt cheated this movie insulted my intelligence br br warning spoilers br br why did anyone accept their false alibi witnessed by the priest if these two guys had been with him why shouldnÂ´t they tell this during the investigation amnesia if you were the judge or member of the jury would you believe it is it wise to give the motif of the murderers away br br i am sorry but in the end the story is very weak and this angers me this movie had great potential 4 10
<START> this movie is very good the screenplay is enchanting but meryl streep is most impressive her performance is excellent she brings me to go into the heart of her role
<START> a sweet natured young mountain man with a sad past henry thomas comes upon an abandoned baby girl in the woods and instantly falls in love with her the town elders generally support him in keeping the child though a local temptress cara seymour thinks little of the new family a determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister travelling salesman david strathairn at his creepiest have parallel stories which converge in a fateful way this is a charming slice of life in the ozarks in the same vein as where the lillies bloom the dollmaker all three were shot on location in those beautiful hills and cover the lives of simple living but not simple minded american folk a minimum of strong language and brief but pointed violence make this fairly safe family viewing
<START> i grew up during the time that the music in this movie was popular what a wonderful time for music and dancing my only complaint was that i was a little too young to go to the uso and nightclubs guess it sounds like i'm living in the past i do have wonderful memories so what's wrong with that world war 2 was a terrible time except where music was concerned glenn miller's death was a terrible sadness to us this movie will be a favorite of mine clio laine was excellent what a voice i don't know how i ever missed this movie my main reason for this commentary is to alert the modern generation to an alternative to rap and new age music which is offensive to me please watch this movie and give it a chance
<START> although the notorious bettie page is well acted and shot is is at best a cliffs notes version of bettie's biography the film mainly centers on her work with irving and paula klaw the brother and sister team who produced the bulk of her most famous photos it does not detail her life after posing aside from her religious rebirth it cites the real bettie page by richard foster as a source but it ignores bettie's later years of mental illness and incarceration in a mental hospital the narrow focus of the biography can be debated but the majority of bettie's fans and the civilians would probably be more interested in her modeling career which is what they get br br the film is well acted with gretchen mol faithfully reproducing the look of bettie as well as conveying the sweetness that her photos exuded the character is played as rather naive a probable byproduct of interviews given by bettie in recent years it is more likely that bettie was aware of the nature of her photos but rationalized it as acting and costumes br br the supporting cast is also outstanding with chris bauer and lili taylor playing irving and paula klaw and david strathairn as estes kefauver the film errs with the character of john willie played by jared harris john willie never met bettie page and was not involved in photo shoots with the klaws harris plays willie a bit like peter o'toole in his more debauched state br br despite the quality of acting the film is a bit of a disappointment in terms of depth the story is rather cursory and we never feel that we truly get to know bettie much like her photos it's just an image it does tend to exaggerate bettie's notoriety her photos were mainly seen in and around new york in a very narrow market of underground and cultish publications her real fame came after her photos were reprinted in the late 70's and 80's and the cult of betty page as her name was usually spelled grew bettie's greatest exposure pardon the pun was in playboy appearing in the january 1955 issue the christmas photo which is staged in reverse in the film br br the film is well done if rather shallow it is able to sustain interest until the end and showcases many fine performances it hits the high points of bettie's life but ignores many details which would have given it far greater depth the ending is rather a let down it feels rather abrupt still the movie is definitely worth viewing by anyone interested in bettie or even the time period the soundtrack is great really pulling the viewer into the 1950's if nothing else the film stands as a showcase for america's burgeoning sexuality and the clash with its puritan past it's also a peek at an icon for both men and women
<START> i've watched almost all of the gundam mech anime that have showed in the us and this by far has the best story the way its plot twists and turns has u riveted gundam wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war the series follows a group of five 15 year old boys who have been trained to pilot state of the art mobile suits known as gundams the gundam pilots were trained to battle a powerful insurgency known as oz as things begin to heat up between oz and the gundam pilots new political groups will form and old ones will dissipate old conflicts will end and new ones will arise to obtain peace the gundam pilots must come to grips with the events taking place in their world and put an end to all the fighting but how far are people willing to go to obtain their goal i recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a show that has a deep plot
<START> this movie was a fantastic comedy it had a lot of comedians star in it like akshay kumar rajpal yadav paresh raval and john abraham br br rimi sen was good at playing akshay kumars wife and so were all the air hostesses mr hot as mac akshay kumar and mr cool as sam john abraham are two fashion photographers who like the same girl maggie neha dupia when john abraham cheats on his work he becomes akshay kumars senior and akshay kumar gets really jealous because his flat has to be given to john abraham and neha dupia starts liking john more akshay kumar wants to be better than john abraham so he finds a flat and he is going out with three different girls nitu chandra nargis bagheri daisy boppana
<START> now i've always been a fan of full moon's puppet work but i have to say that robot jox is one of there better projects yes you heard me the story works wonderful the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first rate job gary graham who really makes his mark on tv in shows like alien nation the series and star trek enterprise shows that he can be an action star who kicks ass and takes name the stop motion effects could have been a tiny bit better the color was wrong they look plastic to me instead of the metal they were suppose to be but that is a minor complaint compared to the whole that is the robot jox if you like gary graham or other full moon movies then you will like this movie 9 stars out of 10
