<START> i watched this with a growing sense of unease why would god in the shape of ian hunter help these particular people in their attempted escape from devils island and what was he doing there in the first place i mean i know god works in mysterious ways but helping thieves and murderers and prostitutes find redemption forgiveness and changes of heart in such a godforsaken location in any event it is hardly a likeable movie whatever gable had by way of charm is missing in this portrait of a thoroughly selfish man crawford is as endearing as ever she was i e to me not at all and the whole look of the film makes it seem as if it was made 10 years before compared to contemperaneous films like stagecoach and mr deeds goes to town this looks prehistoric
<START> series 1 br br as the uk eagerly awaits the launch of series two of 'lost' series one which just finished showing here did not disappoint br br a group of over forty passengers struggle to cope after their plane crash landed into a deserted island they pray for rescue however as the days turn into weeks and the survivors explore the rainforest that surrounds them they begin to wonder whether they are alone br br admittedly the series has a hard time keeping up the pace after the explosive pilot episodes which hurls at the group a polar bear a giant beastie and the possibility of others on the island nevertheless the series manages to pick itself up after a few episodes and is outstanding by the final episode possibly the greatest thing about 'lost' is the fact that we visit each character's life before the crash in a series of flashbacks this gives us more insight and hence more suspense and excitement as the events unfold in the present br br ultimately this show is a superb combination of drama suspense and the supernatural it is quite simply unmissable br br spoilers for season 1 follow br br series 2 br br after the cliffhanger that was the end of series 1 of 'lost' series 2 begins with our protagonists delving deep into the heart of the phenomenon that is the hatch they discover a mysterious man who has a job to do meanwhile michael and sawyer struggle to cope with the aftermath of what happened on the raft br br as the series progresses the viewers will be unable to bring themselves to turn off their television set as every episode of the series contains more twists than a curly wurly chocolate bar one of which introduces a whole host of new characters with every mystery solved with 'lost' five brand new ones seem to come out of the woodworks after the 974th plot twist of the series it finally dawns on the viewer that it doesn't actually matter whether the plane crash survivors make it off the island however the stunning series finale answers just over half of those questions despite its anti climatic ending
<START> gender bender sexes things up a bit for the x files this episode has an interesting premise a good story but an ending that is wanting gender bender is also the x files debut for actor nicholas lea better known as alex krycek in this episode he plays michael a man attacked by one of the kindred you need to see this episode just to see nic lea's less than spectacular beginning an interesting thing about the kindred's power of seduction when marty does it to his victims they become turned onto him her however when andrew seduces scully she only because disoriented and groggy and does not become attracted to andrew maybe it's because marty has more experience at it than andrew this episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be miserable to film up in british columbia throughout the episode it is so wet soggy and muddy it could not have been that much fun despite the disappointing ending gender bender is still a decent episode to view
<START> it is ironic that during the '50s when douglas sirk was at his most successful in terms of audience appeal he was virtually ignored by the criticsÂ he is now seen however as a director of formidable intellect who achieved his best work in melodramaÂ br br written on the wind is about the downfall of a texan oil dynasty surrounded by worthless reputation alcoholism and nymphomaniaÂ it is about the twisted fatal connections between sex power and money br br stack draws a compelling portrait of a tormented drunken destroyed by frustration arrogance jealousy insanity and some deep insecuritiesÂ br br dorothy malone succeeds as an attractive woman with an excessive sexual appetites degrading herself for hudson and to other fellows in townÂ her best line i'm filthy in one frantic scene we see her shaking quivering and sweating to a provocative mamboÂ in another weeping alone over a model oil derrick at her father's deskÂsymbol of excessive wealth and masculine tyrannyÂ br br the frenetic atmosphere is both made palatable and intensified by sirk's magnificent use of colors lights and careful use of mirrorsÂ
<START> against all flags is every bit the classic swashbuckler it has all the elements the adventure fan could hope for and more for in this one the damsel in distress is well not really in distress as spitfire stevens maureen o'hara is at her athletic best running her foes through in defiance of the social norms of the period anthony quinn rounds out the top three billed actors as the ruthless captain roc brasiliano and proves to be a wily and capable nemesis for brian hawke flynn for the classic adventure fan against all flags is a must see while it may not be in quite the same league as some of errol flynn's earlier work captain blood and the sea hawk for instance it is still a greatly entertaining romp

<START> i watched this film many years ago and have searched for it ever since in my opinion although very raw it is very educational as to what the future can hold i enjoyed the movie and to this this day rate it very high sorry to all those that disagree but a movie should always be judged each to there own and in my opinion its great give it a go with all the cloning and test tube babies that are happening today who are we to judge this film this may be a dramatised event of what is to become but there you go all the horrors of today are so far fetched even i laugh but this one gets me thinking and it scares me as a mother what if i was desperate after watching this movie i would think twice sorry but i love the movie make your own mind up don't watch the movie making just aknowledge the story and ask yourself this how far would you go for a child
<START> this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash adorned in black of course who sings a lot and narrates a bit also if you like johnny cash this film is quite enjoyable also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work just for fun try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair anyway its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all
<START> in the same tune as his americana drums along the mohawk john ford captures american history in a way that is fictional yet very believable henry fonda made three consecutive films in this era with ford and all three are about a certain time and place with emphasis on the setting and the cultural surroundings in mohawk pioneer america is in full bloom with americans fending for themselves against indians and other forces here ford shows us 19th century america a time when invention and creativity were beginning to blossom and this nation truly was becoming great amongst it all was a tall lanky young lawyer from illinois named abe lincoln and this film fictionalizes his life as a lawyer foreshadowing the greatness he would later accomplish br br fonda is superb in this movie capturing the essence of what is considered to be the persona of lincoln although no one knows exactly what he was like then the sets and supporting cast also work well together and give a unique balance in ford's picturesque of the american dream and its many forms this is not a film to be taken literally but rather symbolically showing that lincoln was indeed warming up for the events in his life that were to creates his legacy we even get some scenes between him and a young mary todd and it is hard to see how they did end up together but that is not the point i believe this is simply a tribute to the greatness of lincoln widely regarded as the greatest american president his quiet and straightforward demeanor was rare then and would be today indeed our government surely needs more men like him
<START> when i first heard about down to earth i was pretty excited i'm a pretty big fan a chris rock he was especially hilarious in dogma but this film proved to be a disappointment chris rock's performance was not nearly as good as his past performances and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole br br first off chris rock he plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine obviously this works fine in the scenes where he's supposed to be doing standup but in the rest of the movie it doesn't even when he's talking to one other character he seems to think he's trying to make a roomful of people laugh he has a few funny moments but they mostly come during the standup scenes no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian as for the rest of the cast they're pretty much there just to give rock someone to talk to none of them stand out br br also the movie was poorly directed the movie has basically a one joke plot old white guy acting like a young black comedian while i prefer movies with more than one joke this still could have worked and been quite funny the problem was we saw too much of rock and not enough of the old white guy it's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy telling chris rock's jokes but for most of the time we just see chris rock so it's not nearly as funny the few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy talking like rock are in fact hilarious if he had been shown more the movie would have been a lot funnier br br overall a few moments of laughter can't make up for the fact that down to earth is poorly acted and poorly directed this one was a pretty big disappointment br br rating 4 10
<START> as a lesbian i am always on the lookout for films relating to gays lesbians however with this kind of crap out there it would be enough to discourage any audience br br i kept waiting for something to happen anything a story to develop or just for it to make some kind of sense neither occurred it was just meaningless scenes unconnected in any way with anything the film failed to conveyed any kind of story or depth to the character br br after an hour or more of this nonsense i simply turned it off br br don't waste your time on this absurdity br br 1 star and it doesn't even deserve that
<START> kurt russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past glories reno hightower robin williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as jack dundee he dropped the big pass in more ways than one br br you'll see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film as jack hisses at a rat reno poses and the call of the caribou goes out br br don't miss this classic that isn't scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played
<START> my friends usually can put up with a lot of hopeless movies but this one was too poor for us to even watch it to the end it was just so boring and unoriginal not even the hot girls that starred in this movie could keep me watching everything was just predicable and annoying br br the acting was at times good but more times bad the most annoying character in the whole movie that you just wanted to die would have to be the main characters best friend the more i saw him the more i wanted to smash my screen you know what fat ugly kid i'm talking about br br the plot has been done so many times before i think they should be sued by other movie companies ok it is a good idea but thats all this movie had br br overall this movie can only be watched if by your self to save any abuse from your friends or if you have absolutely nothing better to do
<START> yikes this is pretty bad the play isn't great to begin with and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours especially as peploe doesn't decide how she wants to treat the material's theatrical origins we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc and has decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that you're watching a film whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material mira sorvino's central performance is breath takingly poor stage y and plummy it's as if she's playing the part via helena bonham carter's merchant ivory oeuvre only fiona shaw delivers a performance of note and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material but it's hard to watch a film for one performance alone even if that performance is as light truthful and entire as shaw's ben kingsley turns in an average and disengaged turn and diana rigg's daughter rachel stirling plays her supporting role as just that sadly none of bertolucci's magic has rubbed off on his wife if this film is to be the evidence
<START> the main complaint with this film is the fact that i can not tell who is who no racism intended but these asians look all the same i can tell somewhat of the story but heck thats about as far as it goes the peoples identities are not a mystery if they were a mystery i would care about them instead i wasn't them off the screen asap br br tons of wide shots and silent emotionless faces occupy this movie heck is it boring not only do i not know these people but they are just sitting there br br the production is typical chinese john woo terrible video with blotched scenes this looks only slightly better than andy lau's fulltime killer which was a great movie you would think with a decent budget they could at least make it look like 90s hollywood i didn't know the chinese had these art house beatniks
<START> after growing up in the gritty streets of detroit mi and having friends who traveled to new york balls i fell into the lifestyle of being a house member i joined the house of theieves we adapted the same rules as most houses but we were professional crooks that would boost and commit credit card fraud to obtain the fabulous jewels and clothes we desired i even learned how to profess the making of checks and driver's license and cash them in over seventeen states until a jealous queen called the secret service on me and i went to federal prison but i learned a lot from these queens in this movie and i highly recommend you watch it yourself you can even read about how i grew up in the houses here in detroit and the criminal activity we indulged in my book identity schemes is available on sale at amazon dot com or at identity schemes dot com but trust me it is a lot better than paris is burning because its a 2005 make
<START> reviewed at the sept 12 2006 2nd screening at the paramount 1 theatre during the toronto international film festival the film had world premiered the day before at the elgin theatre visa screening room br br the basic plot involves morgan freeman playing a one time popular actor who is on the downward slope of his career and who is taking on roles that may be beneath him but which he still does with a positive attitude knowing that he needs to pay the rent etc the downward slope is indicated by his being a long time between roles with previous flicks in bargain dvd bins and his being chauffeured by a not too sure of himself production assistant who drops freeman off at a local community market where he is going to do research for a role as supermarket manager he soon discovers the real life market is run by a iron willed 10 items or less checkout line clerk played by paz vega when freeman's ride never returns and vega needs help in prepping for an interview the circumstances cause them to join forces in a ride across town to get freeman back home and to get vega a job that'll get her on a more upwardly mobile career path br br while the film was enjoyable it felt like it was still a sketch or a work in progress there were two extended musical sequences one with vega freeman teaching each other children's songs in the car one that literally plays like a paul simon music video that felt like padding to bring up the time and even then the film was only about 80 minutes long br br it's a good thing morgan freeman is as well liked as he is because without him this would have been too little sure it was funny in parts and paz vega is a delight as well but there was just not enough here to say it was a complete film br br they lost me when morgan freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask for directions and paz vega said she never does that who ever heard of a guy wanting to ask for directions and the woman saying no in the real world it's the exact opposite br br make sure you stay for the outtakes in the credits the bit with a target store saleslady teaching morgan freeman how to hustle sales is just hilarious an early bit where freeman's chauffeur insists it is freeman's voice on a books on tape reading was also pretty funny br br the director writer brad silberling and actress paz vega were there for a brief q a after the screening silberling answered one question saying that the script was not written specifically for morgan freeman and that once freeman took the role he actually changed very little of what was there quite a compliment for both silberling's writing and also about how freeman can just slip into a role and make it feel entirely like he was born to play it
<START> just in time to capitalize on the long awaited movie version of dreamgirls is the dvd release of this semi forgotten 1976 musical melodrama that also takes the rise of the supremes as its inspiration released five years before the broadway opening of dreamgirls and partially set in the same period it has a predominantly black cast and a story revolving around an up and coming girl group and that's where the resemblance basically ends written by joel schumacher well before he became a big league director of mainstream studio product batman forever the phantom of the opera this movie seems grittier on the surface true to form however schumacher weakens the storyline and character development by injecting an abundance of clichÃ©s and eye rolling one liners with little affinity for staging musical numbers sam o'steen a highly regarded film editor but neophyte director helms the production like a low budget tv movie with a frustratingly episodic structure br br the story follows three harlem sisters sexy sister self righteous delores and sweet sparkle as they sing in the church choir meet smooth talking but well intentioned boys stix and levi and then find their first taste of success as a singing group first as a sweater wearing quintet called the hearts and then as a glitzy trio known as sister and the sisters but naturally there are problems beyond the silly name for the group sister gets involved with nasty drug dealer satin struthers who beats her and turns her into a cocaine junkie levi goes to prison for getting caught in a drug pick up for satin stix gets frustrated by failure and unwisely turns to some jewish mobsters for financial help delores just gets plain fed up and poor little sparkle has to decide what kind of future she wants a big plus is that r b great curtis mayfield wrote the atmospheric songs some catchy and one look into your heart a real winner br br the solid cast does its best under the contrived circumstances lonette mckee's valiant attempt to make sister a tragic figure is undercut by some of the ham fisted plot turns including a sad billie holliday like turn at the mike before they hit it big on primetime tv philip michael thomas and dorian harewood portray stix and levi with boyish vitality if not much credibility the best work comes from mary alice in a relatively silent turn as the girls' patient mother and a pre fame irene cara who effortlessly exudes sincerity in the title role though her costumer and hair stylist should be shot for the hideous look she achieves in the final scene the dvd just comes with the original theatrical trailer complete with an unctuous voice over by dj casey kasem and a bonus cd of five of the film's songs performed not by the original cast but by aretha franklin off her 1976 recording of the soundtrack it's not a terrible movie just an interesting if lacking curio that happens to cover the same ground as dreamgirls
<START> this is simply put the worst movie i have ever seen it ranges from like 2 hours and the box art was totally misleading my friends and i rented it because we thought it would be a poor man's 300 you know to laugh at and make fun of no there is nothing funny about this movie only pain then the movie starts up and they are speaking some sort of different language we think 'oh its just the beginning ' but no from there the movie plummets and becomes more of like a super boring book you had to read in grade school where nothing literally happens for hours and the battle scenes rival those of 2 kids fighting on a playground omit cinematography and this movie belongs in trash compactor movies like this will lead to the world we see in wall e which by the way was a good movie
