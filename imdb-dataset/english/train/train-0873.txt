<START> tim robbins and john cusack are two actors i have appreciated throughout their careers and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie well all i can say is i totally regretted it these two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant unimaginative and kitch to the extreme not that this is bad on its own sketches that are supposed to make people laugh but fail to do so the only reason i can think is that the director was their friend and they decided to support his movie by starring in it i can't think of anything else because this movie is so cheap fortunately tim robbins and john cusack haven't disappointed me ever since i would recommend you to avoid this film unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled
<START> the man in the moon is a pretty good movie it is very touching at times and is very well done in all respects i wouldn't say the film was terribly original but what is these days br br the cast members all did a great job with their respective roles i really enjoyed seeing reese witherspoon at such a young age and does quite a good job jason london does a fine job as well and the only other person i recognized was sam waterston who did a fantastic job with his role i really liked sam's character matthew trant a lot at times he seemed to be the kind of father you dread but in the end you really like his character the rest of the cast was very good as well br br if you're into touching movies about growing up and dealing with what life throws at you then you ought to watch this film i'd suggest reading the plot synopsis and if that sounds like something you'd be interested in then go for it anyhow hope you enjoy the film thanks for reading br br chris
<START> this is an extremely boring film if you grew up during the vietnam was as i did then you've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now but what really makes this film boring is the narration by director carlton sherwood the majority of the film is shot with sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation br br if you're old enough to remember vietnam then you won't find anything new here there is no new evidence to condemn john kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on vietnam younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see george butler's excellent film going upriver stolen honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on john kerry but it fails miserably at accomplishing that goal
<START> i am frankly surprised how little has been done in film on the columbine massacre there isn't a major documentary very puzzling fortunately we are graced with the talent of ben coccio who directed zero day and gus van sant who did the equally fine elephant two different takes on the event which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery that there's something ultimately baffling and unknowable about the motivations of the two killers and what actually drove them to carry it beyond fantasy into horrible reality zero day purportedly made up of videotapes made by the shooters and found after the event is absolutely riveting even if you know where it's going you still harbor hope that it won't go there and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is excruciating the film is terrific from top to bottom from director to script not much improvised though it appears very spontaneous to the two lead actors and the supporting players as well there is only one aspect of zero day that troubled me okay so we can't fathom why the shooters would do what they did but certainly one of the contributors was their anger yet these boys don't really seem angry they may say some things to indicate that they are but in fact they didn't convince me that they had something inside them that compelled them to kill innocent people but this still leaves me with the sense of why that director coccio wants me to have anyway rent or buy this movie it will creep up on you and stay with you for a long time the blair witch folks could only wish for the kind of success these guys had at making a mock documentary
<START> really they spelled it brain in the credits not brian br br ok they didn't have the budget for a spell checker all the production money went for great old cars there are at least two packards visible here one is a darin convertible a nice yellow packard convertible br br the scenes of the movie studio show that there was some money spent for costumes and set decorations old cameras an exterior of ciro's street signs and whatever was needed to make a visually pleasing picture was there poorly written and directed br br my dvd says it runs for 104 minutes approximately it was more like 85 minutes it came to an end without reaching a conclusion there was a collision but no conclusion the movie just smashed up against the credits 99 cents for this i paid 99 cents for this i could have bought 3 cans of cat food and watched my cat's face as he emoted more excitement br br for a few seconds in the ciro's scene after darren mcgavin gets a phone call it looked like maybe this movie would have a surprise twist that would make for an interesting film then it just sat there br br the young latin actor played by steven bauer tony montoya could have had a much bigger part in all that was going on here this cast could have made a good film br br i think if they cut brian's part and use steven bauer in his place and change the script and keep the packards and lose the band and add a johnny otis sound alike band then they got something br br here kitty kitty br br tom willett
<START> i am a fan of animal movies if you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over homeward bound did just this they took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it it was a complete success it is very much an archetypal movie you have the obi wan of the group shadow who is wise and logical you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting chance and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised these three personalities bounce off of each other very well i also like how they made chance and sassy such dynamic characters and they did not overdue it most people say that it cannot be good because it is too much of a kids film what they are forgetting however is that it is supposed to be a kids film and this still does not take away from the acual movie this is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie it is a disney movie without the cartoons an air bud movie with a better plot i would without a doubt advise you to watch it
<START> paul jason lee is an underachiever who just happens to be engaged to a type a princess named karen selma blair she chooses his clothes and his daily schedule at his bachelor party paul gets a little too drunk and somehow ends up taking a pretty dancer named becky julia stiles back to his digs nothing happened as they say but the duo do wake up in the same bed suddenly karen telephones she's on her way to paul's apartment understandably paul hustles becky out of the place although her underpants are left behind but there is even more fun ahead at a family dinner at karen's parents' home paul runs smack into becky again learning that she is karen's cousin talk about some explaining to do but instead paul chooses to feign a stomach problem and hides out in the bathroom will karen ever find out that becky spent the night at paul's place and what will be the consequences i'm sorry for critics who pan movies like this they should definitely lighten up for this film is fresh and fun of course it doesn't hurt matters that lee is a consummate funny man stiles is a charming beauty or that blair is a natural as a pretty but anal fiancÃ©e the rest of the cast including james brolin and julie haggerty is also quite nice the look of the film is wonderful as are the costumes and california settings best of all the script is imaginative and inspired creating big laughs for the audience in short if you want to tickle the proverbial funnybones get this movie tonight it may not be academy award material but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a darn good one
<START> baseketball is an extremely funny movie that delivers acting that generally makes the movie alot funnier comedy material that is more than crap in your pants funny and a pretty good plot despite the fact that its the classic slackers v s the evil rich guy the one and only thing i didnt like about baseketball was that that kid wasnt really needed in the movie but if the kid wasnt in the movie some of the funny scenes wouldnt have existed if you have read any pro reviews about this movie exclude them all because basically all the reviewers didnt like this film baseketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want 8 out of 10
<START> i saw this regurgitated pile of vignettes tonight at a preview screening and i was straight up blown away by how bad it was br br first off the film practically flaunted its gaping blind spots there are no black or gay new yorkers in love or who say know the self involved white people in love i know it's not the love crash of anvil tastic inclusiveness but you can't pretend to have a cinematic new york with out these fairly prevalent members of society plus you know the people who produced this ish thought crash deserved that ham handed oscar so where is everyone br br possibly worse than the bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were the down right offensive chapters remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in wheelchairs me either this movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst bad acting bad writing bad directing all spanning every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants br br but thank god they finally got powerhouses hayden christensen and rachel bilson back together for that jumper reunion and side note uma dodged a bullet ethan hawke looks ravaged this of course is one thing in terms of his looks but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of horribleness to his terrifyingly scripted scene opposite poor lovely maggie q br br i had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film questionnaire but it has to be the anton yelchin olivia thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste which saddens me because i really like those two actors i don't consider myself easily offended but all i could do was scoff and look around with disgust like someone's 50 year old aunt br br a close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is shia labeouf's tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former disney channel star to act against julie christie i don't mean opposite i mean against against is the only explanation i realize now that the early sequence with orlando bloom is a relative highlight highlight please keep that in mind when your brain begins to leak out your ear soon after the opening credits which seem to be a nod to the first new york real world this film is embarrassing strangely dated inarticulate ineffective pretentious and in the end completely divorced from any real idea of new york at all br br the extra star is for the cloris leachman eli wallach sequence as it is actually quite sweet but it is only one bright spot in what feels like hours of pointless masturbatory torment
<START> although in some aspects seven pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style gabriele muccino's project is rather mediocre the movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end hearts human and emotional eyes physical and metaphorical seven pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of alejandro gonzÃ¡lez iÃ±Ã¡rritu's amores perros and 21 grams with lots and lots of flashbacks the problem is the story is quite predictable from very easily on through the movie that's too bad because seven pounds could have been as authentically good if ben and emily had been put in the right hands
<START> this one tends to get slighted by a lot of critics and kurosawa fans but i thought it was wonderful it's an episodic multi character study of tokyo's poorest who live in a city literally made from garbage though it looks like an a bomb just hit the film has a sort of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of technicolor the title comes from the sound made by the insane young man who drives an imaginary trolley through the slum all the characters were wonderful and all the stories engrossing but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car when not searching for food they spend their spare time using their imagination to build their dream house an emotionally moving and beautiful film
<START> if you like the standard sly flicks that involve over the top action unbelievable stunts unbelievable is not intended to be complimentary here and retarded dialogue you will love this steaming pile of mountain goat dung i had high hopes based on the trailer i thought that stalone was going to be forced in his has been days to yield to smarter people and make an action film that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story setting and believable action would prevail i crave action that is at least close enough to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event my limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects rendered at least one scene laughably ridiculous judge dredd is only better because you know going into the theater that you are going to see a comic book made into a movie the character setting and everything else are beyond comparison to anything we might encounter ourselves cliffhanger on the other hand turns a mountain climbing guide into rambo before you can say yo adrian
<START> silverlake life the view from here is an absolutely stunning movie about aids as well as about a gay love relationship some images are indeed really hard to take especially when one is gay or fears about aids and probably for any sensitive person watching it it's not easy to make a movie about such a terrible illness and its consequences about not only one but two people's lives this movie teaches how to care for each other in such hard times but it never gets too morbid it still shows life at any time reminding you that outside of the theater or of your room life goes on whatever the destiny of some people may be the characters are incredibly endearing while we watch their intimacy in shots that never go beyond a very strict limit never unveiling anything too private or offensive children should certainly not watch this movie but grown ups whether they have to deal with such situations or not should do it and will not regret the tears they shed
<START> spike lee has to be one of the most over rated directors i have ever seen he is the critic's darling because he supposedly makes films with a message or he is just so bohemian in his approach that it makes critics that are waterlogged from formula hollywood films eat his stuff up just for being different br br summer of sam does not even do that well the cinematography and editing style is oliver stone and so is the narrative the plot is a lot like do the right thing the portrayal of guidos or for the pc set italian americans of which i happen to be one is straight out of eddie murphy's raw only eddie murphy's impression of a macho italian guy picking a fight with a much taller african american is much much more believable than the cartoonish broad italian caricatures shown here the john leguizamo character being a possible exception br br is there anybody who saw this movie that could not figure out how it was going to end up as soon as richie came into the film i could already see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach i could already see him being accused of being the killer this character had the most integrity in the whole film so of course lee is going to show what happens to people that stand out in a crowd what a white bearded clique br br someone please please give spike lee a lifetime pass to all the basketball games he wants so maybe he will be enjoying himself too much to pick up a film camera for a long time and we won't have to be subjected to his self important drivel and furthermore i won't have to see critics some of them whom i respect ohhhh and ahhhh to an emperor with no clothes
<START> i had never heard of this one before it turned up on cable tv it's very typical of late 50s sci fi sober depressing and not a little paranoid despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is humanly possibly for what is unmistakably an extremely low budget venture while not uninteresting in itself the apocalypse via renegade missile angle later utilized with far greater aplomb for both dr strangelove 1964 and fail safe 1964 and mercifully short the film's single minded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter particularly in the scenes involving an imminent childbirth and a gang of clueless juvenile delinquents
<START> we've all seen this story a hundred times you can see each plot turn coming a mile away the relationship between the mother and daughter is way too sweet and understanding to pass for realistic janet mcteer's performance is stock southern hot ticket mother in vintage clothes should have been made for the lifetime channel
<START> this electrifying musical has more than a whiff of egotism from it's star the musical genius that is prince the film is 90 or so minutes of posing but in truth it is easy to see why it is such a cult classic br br much like other films that centre around the struggling young musician trying to be big this has a hint of drama in it to add a dimension to the musical numbers while this film isn't as good as 8 mile as a recent example this is entertaining none the less and the soundtrack is much better on the dramatic side of things the story centres around the kid prince a young artist and regular spot at a club the owner of the club is frustrated with the kid's arrogance and little does the kid know that he could soon be fired and replaced by a rival one the side the kid's parents are having trouble with his dad abusing her violently during the course of the film the kid learns a few lessons in life and learns to appreciate his friends more it's all stuff we have seen in coming of age dramas of course but this is combined as a musical a very stylised musical br br the cast are good prince is actually quite good on the drama side when he's not striking a pose he seems human and relatable clarence williams is very good as the abusive father as well appollonia kotero makes a good debut as princes sexy love interest br br the main strength of the movie however is the superb soundtrack the musical numbers are well staged and electrifying prince is no doubt a musical maestro albeit very eccentric when he is inspired he is great but on the flip side he will often do songs that are solely for his own taste and occasionally his experimentation can miss fire but that is the same for many musical geniuses the soundtrack for this film is excellent though with only sexshooter being a weak point the show stopping performance of purple rain is the standout though it is one of my all time favourite songs br br
<START> i would love to comment on this film alas my search has always endeth in vain if any good citizen could help a desperate inhabitant of this ailing planet and restore his confidence in humanity by offering the whereabouts of either a uk vhs or loan him a dvd copy of the vhs he would without reservation be eternally grateful br br blake wrote the road to excess is the path to wisdom one hopes my weary road of excess will offer the path to fruition if not i will have to replay the excellent mr russel's gothic in the knowledge that those who have seen haunted summer for better or for worse have enriched their viewing pleasure of the events of july 1816 whilst i a fellow member of this melodious plot rests his lonely case in solitude
<START> this is a genuinely horrible film the plot such as it is is totally undecipherable i think it has something to do with blackmail but i'm not entirely certain br br half of the dialogue consists of useless cliches the other half is spoken by the various actors in such unintelligible imitations of southern accents that thankfully the words cannot be recognized br br but the one true tragedy of the movie is that such a historic talent as mary tyler moore apparently was in such dire financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it br br
<START> far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30's and 50's george c scott was born to be scrooge just as he was born to be patton mr scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century the character of scrooge as played by mr scott seemed to jump off the screen scott as scrooge brought an richer more robust yet a more deeply moving scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century london mr scott seemed to bring scrooge to a more personal understandable yet highly conflicted level his role was acted with the great authority scott always bring to the screen yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper almost as a soliloquy as he would berate the christmas holiday in one breath yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line he could portray the sour and crusty scrooge and a misunderstood sympathetic scrooge all in the same scene br br truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation
