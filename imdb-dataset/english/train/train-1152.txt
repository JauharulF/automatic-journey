<START> this movie had what sounded like a good premise 9 people facing their fears to win one million dollars unfortunately it did not turn out to be a good movie there are several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene a few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts the acting is bad but some of the lines are amusing in their awfulness what's really strange is that towards the end of the movie it turns into like a 5 minute western and at the end the twists of which their were several don't make sense with the rest of the movie it seemed as though the director just added stuff on because he thought it would look cool while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point it just didn't make a lot of sense the only creepy thing was the old people dancing down the hall but that doesn't even come close to making up for the rest of this mess
<START> i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film i managed to stomach 45 50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead which by the way is great fun br br the story has massive holes in it the plot line is hugely over stated and dull the acting is awful especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at looking daft and singing like a castrato morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet freeman and timberlake's characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father son relationship of sorts or something which simply isn't evident at all apart from the fact that though freeman's character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up br br it would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion br br don't watch this film it is a pure waste of time
<START> polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness which he explored to such tremendous effect in repulsion and rosemary's baby in the tenant br br the atmosphere is trademark polanski dark brooding unnerving but there is something awkward about this movie and i am not sure whether or not it is deliberate br br sven nykvist who was responsible for some of bergman's most beautiful films doesn't quite do himself justice here as his name was one of the things which really attracted me to this movie i was a little disappointed in how few instances of truly impressive cinematography are in the film br br the only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting polanski is certainly not a bad actor but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of trelkovsky some of the supporting cast are great notably melvyn douglas as the landlord and shelley winters as the concierge but others are weak and miscast it is also hard to get past the fact that all these supposed parisians have american accents br br quite unexpectedly there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the film anyone who has seen the fearless vampire killers knows that polanski is certainly a good comedic actor however there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself trelkovsky's sudden and somewhat unexplained 'transformation' is more likely to raise giggles than eyebrows which detracts from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho dramatic journey br br all in all the tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience if a little too languorous for its own good there's a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and a consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this film while being very good does not quite hit the mark as successfully as it could have br br alas at the end of the day an 'okay' polanski movie is still better than most other 'good' movies definitely worth a watch just don't expect to be blown away
<START> the notorious bettie page written by mary harron guinevere turner directed by mary harron br br how do you define a person who has always been between two worlds one of presumed sin and one of supposed redemption especially when that person eventually succumbed to a split personality disorder in her latter years as if to demonstrate her own point if you're director mary harron you don't shy away from showing the push pull nature of the notorious bettie page you allow the character to drift back and forth between the healing forgiveness of the power of god and the church and the seductive illusion of control and dominance afforded to page during her years as a pinup model by doing so audiences are offered a complex character that is propelled forward by a desire to leave her difficult past with a naive enjoyment in others' lust for her and a struggle to reconcile her image in the eyes of god come the right time it will no longer matter how many eyes are on her because there is only one pair that counts br br shot mostly in black and white with some unnecessary bursts of color the notorious bettie page is at times a light humorous comedy making the film an enjoyable experience and also one that pokes fun at how seriously people believe in the corruption of pornography but the delicate hand of the director is more palpably felt during page's times of despair harron is a sensitive considerate director who does not throw page's numerous and devastating blows of abuse in the face of her viewer instead she allows the surprisingly effective gretchen moll who plays the title role the chance to hammer the pain of her character into the viewer with fear in her eyes exhaustion is her cries and shame on her skin whereas most directors perhaps most male directors would find it essential to show the heroine in painful positions in order to draw a link between the kinds of atrocities that were put upon her and where her life took her harron has too much compassion for her character her actress and her audience from fragility page learns to trust people again and as more and more photographers fall in love with her image the more she falls in love with their admiration and the control she has over the gaze by the time her poses cross over into the realm of soft core s m she has found a way to combine her need to be respected with the objectification she has been accustomed to her whole life br br mary harron's bettie page is a woman who yearns for control over her life and destiny yet ultimately is always being told where to stand how to smile and what to wear when she finally realizes that none of her choices have been her own she chooses to embrace god and preach his word to those who will listen the true sadness behind this most important decision is that she is still letting someone else guide her blindly she just has more faith that this direction will be better for her soul
<START> my girlfriend once brought around the zombie chronicles for us to watch as a joke little did we realize the joke was on her for paying Â£1 for it while watching this film i started to come up with things i would rather be doing than watching the zombie chronicles these included br br 1 drinking bleach 2 rubbing sand in my eyes 3 writing a letter to brad sykes and garrett clancy 4 re enacting the american civil war 5 tax returns 6 gcse maths 7 sex with an old lady br br garrett clancy aka sgt ben draper wrote this the guy couldn't even dig a hole properly the best ting he did was kick a door down the best part of the film this was the worst film i have ever seen and i've seen white noise the light never has a film had so many mistakes in it my girlfriend left it here so now i live with the shame of owning this piece of crap br br news just in owen wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself fact br br do not watch
<START> macarthur is a great movie with a great story about a great manÂgeneral douglas macarthur this is of course the story of one of america's great military figures and a figure made familiar to me from the earliest moments of my memory though there is a continuity issue there may be others e g macarthur's speech portrayed in the film as his 1962 address to the u s military academy on accepting the thayer award did not contain the phrase old soldiers never die they just fade away that was in his speech to congress upon his dismissal by president truman in 1951 for his alleged insubordination these two did not see eye to eye gregory peck is im peck able as the general who vowed he would return to the philippines in world war ii the film moves quickly and easily with the general his family and his staff from the beginning of the second world war to the end of his service career this film would be of much greater significance to one familiar with both ww ii and the korean war nevertheless peck's portrayal of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can is a memorable one indeed in war there is no substitute for victory

<START> this was a disappointing movie considering the material army life is always good for a laugh and the stars this movie should have been a fall down laughfest it was worth a couple of chuckles at best steve martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that dan ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles where he might follow robin williams' lead and someday win an oscar
<START> bsg is one of my all time favourite tv series i was lucky enough to start watching it as the series came to it's final season it was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was br br as soon as i noticed the pilot on hulu i knew exactly what i was in for just by the title caprica although some things don't add up when you compare both series it is still beautifully executed there were no mention about the holobands in battlestar galactica or the mention of virtual worlds but maybe i haven't got far enough into the series for them to explain why br br i recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe technology and alternate fantasies of our world this show is very interesting and will have you wanting to watch more
<START> follow the fleet an rko production in 1936 stars fred astaire and ginger rogers in a complex romantic comedy although fred astaire and ginger rogers have had many similar romantic movies together rko helped them to once again create a worth while storyline that incorporates relevant situations to society at the time it was made the narrative of follow the fleet relies heavily on the use of layered story lines between the two sets of main characters to create a satisfying romantic comedy br br the general plot of the movie revolves around bake baker a sailor in the u s navy played by fred astaire and sherry martin bake's former love and dance partner who is now a singer and dancer played by ginger rogers their story begins when bake is on the ship and his shipmate bilge smith finds a photo of the two of them together and bake reveals that the last time he saw her he had asked her to marry him so bilge suggests that they try and meet up with her when they are on land in hopes that she might have a friend br br the next major scene begins the second plot of the movie when connie martin sherry's sister is refused entry into paradise where her sister works unless she is escorted by a gentleman she turns around to find bilge behind her with a bag full of beverages so she plays it off like she was waiting on him and buys his entrance into paradise as well connie then finds sherry and tells her that she is depressed because she cannot have the luck sherry does with men so sherry suggests she get a makeover from her friends while she is performing on stage connie gets made over and enters the ballroom once again and approaches bilge again who is awestruck by the sight of her this commences the second romantic storyline between bilge and connie br br throughout the remainder of the movie the story and rising actions are transitioned between altering comedic reliefs of the two couples' troubles that create several mini rising and falling actions within the overall plot bake and sherry hit it off their first moments together as they compete in a dance competition and end up winning it reminding them of the success and pleasure the two have when they are together similarly bilge is able to swoon connie through his romantic attempts of pleasing her and they retire to her house br br this series of happy events is soon followed by unsettling measures that brings the rising action back down bake left sherry the previous night to retire to the ship before midnight and told her that he would come for her in the morning unfortunately the ship sets course after the shipmates have returned upsetting sherry and leaving her to think bake was still being a typical sailor looking for a good time when he's on land br br the mood is again changed as another subplot is entered into the film when a party of big shots is taking a tour of the ship this alternate storyline is used to create a buffer between the stories of the two main relationships of the film as well as help build confidence and fondness of bake's overall good intentions the party is interrupted by the oblivious music playing coming from bake and his companions when they missed the sounding to report on deck for the company the ladies are intrigued and ask to hear them play and bake gladly begins to entertain them with some dancing which ultimately helps brighten the mood of the film as well as bring happiness to the sailors br br after returning to the couple's intertwined stories sherry is trying to prove to bake that she does not need his help with landing a job unfortunately bake is unaware that she is auditioning and goes to put in a good word for sherry when he overhears his friend at the studio talking about the remarkable lady auditioning bake takes it upon himself to help sherry out by tampering with her water making her unable to sing correctly and destroying her audition in addition to bake's mistake connie spent all of her money to repair a ship that she was hoping bilge would take over as captain she had also planned a remarkable dinner date for him when he was supposed to come over but bilge was aware of her intentions and hopes of soon marrying and was no longer interested so he stood her up br br the remainder of the movie continues in the same format of mini rising and falling actions until the climactic point is reached between the two couples ending the movie with the happiness of both couples the use of the altering stories helps to build interest and emotion within each couple as they deal with both happiness and pain through each of their struggles the intertwining stories are also able to relate with one another as well as incorporate other unrelated subplots to help carry the narrative through to the concluding scenes br br although fred astaire and ginger rogers have countless films together that incorporate romance comedy song and dance follow the fleet is a unique film for the two actors that successfully use the technique of subplots to aid the narrative between the two main characters
<START> 54 is a film about a club with that very title in the setting of the 70s era it features the classic good looking bartender the sexy females the high powered owner the partying when all entwined together chaos ensues and the bartender played by phillipe seems to be at the brunt of it all br br i'm going to be as blunt and honest as possible whilst avoiding any outright unfair or untrue comments like it's an 'ok' film i really do find it a completely dire film complimented by it's dire cast every time i sit down to watch a film casting salma hayek i am always awaiting to see her beauty radiantly expressed simultaneously with a great performance but reality invariably reminds me quite abruptly how utterly talentless she is i mean really what has she ever bequeathed the masses with other than her immense table dance in 'from dusk till dawn' the same goes for ryan phillippe another poor actor who gives nothing to the screen but his good looks and insanely dull facade otherwise known as 'acting' mike myers isn't quite as bad as these 2 he does at least give the film something worthy playing the seedy extroverted co founder of the 54 club the type that the majority watching would hate i e job well done he puts in a somewhat convincing performance that gave me rare enjoyment from the flick but alas it is not enough to rescue the film from it's baseless and flat nothingness most 'bad' bad films i find something to take from the film but this has nothing to it really neve campbell isn't too bad but she is just 'there' the storyline is dull it appears the writer was more bent on making a film of this style and embellishment and forgot to add anything else any meaning any class anything at all because like most ornaments they are just hollow pointless objects that are merely pretty to look at much akin to the basis of this disastrous film br br genuinely an hour and a half of time i could have spent better doing something much more exciting like talking to 90 year old relatives on the phone about the weather
<START> i saw this film at the toronto international film festival filmed during an actual qualifying match for the 2006 world cup offside works brilliantly as both a comedy and a tragedy the film follows the fortunes of a group of young women who are caught trying to sneak into a football match at tehran's azadi stadium the country's islamic religious leaders have decreed that women may not sit with men at sporting events lest they be exposed to cursing and other morally questionable behaviour this hasn't stopped the country's young female fans who continue to sneak in using various tricks but panahi focuses on a small group who have been caught and are being detained agonizingly close to the action they beg the bored soldiers guarding them to let them go or at least to let them watch the match the soldiers tell them they shouldn't have tried to get in that they could have watched the game at home on tv they banter back and forth in almost real time as the game continues just off camera br br there is one very funny sequence where a young soldier accompanies one of the girls to the restroom since there are no female restrooms at stadiums he has to clear the room of any men before he can allow her to go in plus he makes her cover her face so no one can see she's a woman this is accomplished using a poster of iranian soccer star ali daei as a mask with eye holes punched out br br you get a real sense that even the soldiers are baffled by the prohibition and are only carrying out their orders so as to hasten the end of their compulsory military service one soldier complains that he was supposed to be on leave so he could take care of his family's cattle in the countryside little by little the girls and the soldiers talk to each other and there are numerous small acts of kindness on both sides to show that these are basically good people living in terrible circumstances however the soldiers' constant reminder that the chief is on his way lends a sense of menace since we don't know what sort of punishment the women will face br br unlike most iranian films which are known for their strong visuals offside is filmed in a realist style with no artifice in fact the film was made during the actual qualifying match against bahrain that took place on june 5 2005 the plot in many ways was determined by the result on the pitch if iran won the match they would qualify if they lost they would not since the world cup has come and gone i don't think it is a spoiler to say that iran won the match the scenes of celebration at the end of the film were real and spontaneous which gave the film a real authenticity seeing how much this meant to the people of iran was deeply touching br br as well one of the young women makes reference at the end of the film to seven fans who died during the iran japan match on march 25 just a few weeks before they were trampled to death after police began to spray the crowd with water to move them in a certain direction knowing that this was a real life tragedy added another level of poignancy to the celebrations br br i don't want to go off on a long political tangent but this film gave me real hope that there are those in iran who are hoping for change and working at it iran is a nation of young people and it is only a matter of time before they take the place of their elders in the political sphere films like this one show the proud spirit of the iranian people in spite of their present difficulties and it's my sincere hope that there is a brighter future for them
<START> as soon as i heard about this film i knew i had to check it out well i heard about it then i found the trailer after that that's when i knew i had to see it and i am so glad i did you want to see classic television mixed with zombies no then get lost br br fido is a movie unlike anything i've ever seen well actually it kind of is it's kind of like a lassie episode and a zombie film though when combined it feels completely new and original fido is about a little boy named timmy and his new pet fido well this new pet ain't no squawking parakeet or some potty trained puppy it's a re animated dead guy a zombie a large radiation cloud engulfed earth which led to all of the dead rising which ensued the zombie wars though through the genius of reinhold giger lead scientist of zomcon he discovered that if you destroy the brain the zombie will perish thus giving us the edge and the win in the zombie war though due to lingering radiation whoever dies becomes a zombie which can be a problem especially with the elderly though zomcom steps up again with more breakthroughs especially with the domestication collar the collar stops the zombie's need for human flesh and thus making it harmless as a household pet but not all is perfect in this zombie utopia collars break old people die and well i'll just let you watch this incredibly unique flick br br fido is a fantastic idea brought to fruition with an all star cast and great writing fido rises above most in the comedy horror genre there are plenty of funny and original situations that really had me entertained though after seeing the film i personally think the movie would have been better in black and white at less than 90 minutes the movie doesn't go on for too long and moves from scene to scene at a good rate it'll probably end up being a cult classic of sorts since it's not really a laugh out loud comedy or even a horror movie it's a comedy family zombie film immersed in the 1950 vibe if you thought anything i said here was interesting by all means check this film out but if you're still on the fence swing your leg back over and stay there 8 5 outta 10
<START> honestly this is easily in the top 5 of the worst movies i have ever seen partly because it takes itself so seriously as opposed to regular light hearted trash this movies wants you to be emotionally involved to feel for the characters and to care about the alleged conspiracy none of this ever even comes close to happening br br mild spoilers br br there are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible 1 incoherent and totally non sensical plot 2 annoying style over substance mtv camerawork 3 moronic characters and plot holes br br allow me to elaborate br br 1 apparently when this movies was being made they couldn't decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracies the stigmata or possession so guess what they combined them an aetheist gets possessed by a dead person who then makes her exhibit the stigmata so as to expose a church conspiracy how a regular person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained nor even talked about now instead of just saying what he wants to say he gives her the stigmata why why not just spit it out instead we get treated to scenes of screaming things in harsh voices carving cryptic messages on cars and writing messages on walls apparently this priest was also a violent guy because the possessed young lady also wigs out on one o f the characters while talking in that cliched harsh possessed voice that we all have heard countless times this also starts to tie into my second complaint because whenever the young lady gets the stigmata she also defies the laws of gravity by floating into the air and tossing everything and everybody around her as if they were in an earthquake why does this happen who knows my guess is that the director thought it looked cool br br 2 this movies contains dozens of shots in slow motion of course of birds showing up out of nowhere and flying off and most annoyingly of water dripping this woman's apartment is constantly dripping water constantly logically the place would probably fall apart with this many holes to sum up this complaint towards the end and for absolutely no reason the camera cuts to shots of water dripping in slow motion in reverse why i have no idea it has no relevance to anything and once again i'm betting it's because the director thought it looked cool br br 3 one of the main characters says he became a priest to explain away holes in science this doesn't make sense to me i would think that going to church would be enough but no he has to go through the entire rigamarole of becoming a priest i just don't buy it secondly there are lots of plot holes a few of which i will elaborate on below for starters when she first gets the stigmata the scene ends with her laying unconscious bleeding next she's in the hospital who called the ambulance another one is towards the end when the previously mentioned scientific priest character is talking to the spirit who is possessing the girl he says take me as your messenger not a word for word quote but you get the idea his response you have no faith only doubt so because of this he possesses an aetheist an aetheist has no faith far less then any scientific priest and then there's the fact that the object of this movie's conspiracy this lost gospel of st thomas i believe is available at local bookstores the characters are willing to kill to supress this document but you could walk down to a bookstore and buy it maybe this is supposed to take place in an alternate history where it isn't wide known but the movie never tries to tell us this or to even hint that this is an alternate happening of that document's uncovering br br in closing this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree it is my arch nemesis which i feel the need to insult every chance i get i loathe it final grade f
<START> a must see i saw whipped at a press screening and it was hilarious we're talking nonstop laughs it makes something about mary seem like a meandering drama amanda peet screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty brains and serious acting ability peter cohen the director has made a cutting edge film that shows the raw inside of men's egos in the urban dating world for all of it's comedy whipped succeeds with it's intelligence which is so rare for a first time director especially with a romantic comedy he is a major talent judah domke brian van holt jonathan abrahams and zorie barber round out the cast with depth and very strong performances as the would be slick lady's men you've got to see these guys go to work and get caught in peet's web check out the trailer on whipped com it's worth the 3 minute download
<START> best of the best 4 is better than 3 but just barely basically i say this because part 4 doesn't contradict parts 1 2 like 3 does ie their is no reference to tommy lee having siblings br br anyway i liked the russian plot line of the story and especially sven ole thorsen's bit part as boris aside from that though and a few fighting scenes the movie is nothing special the limited budget is also very noticeable especially in the airplane blow up scene br br also part 4 does not really have a moral or say anything like part 3 did there are a couple of more better known actors hudson thorsen in part 4 but alas nothing like the beginning of the series and even these characters have very small roles br br alas it seems best of the best is the rhee show and to be truthful he cannot carry a movie br br saw on tape rating 4
<START> honestly who in god's name gave this movie an 8 1 rating i guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted otherwise this movie sucks this movie is nothing more than an amateur or possibly student film i'm a movie fanatic and have seen terrible movies but there was literally nothing redeeming here the story and acting was the worst i've ever seen the props including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects where just as bad as everything else i'm all for bad language in movies but the f bomb was dropped about every third word and i think we might have a winner for the most use of the f bomb in any movie ever the movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film i'd expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country but it doesn't belong on a dvd br br do not buy this movie do not rent this movie all i can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon this is valuable time that you will never get back unfortunately for me that time is lost but it's not too late for you if you decide to rent this movie consider this my warning
<START> nice pleasant and funny but not earth shattering it does a good job of showing the behind the scenes world of theater groups and the lives of the actors the three witches are great both on and off stage i would assume the movie works wonderfully lots of apparent inside jokes if one was involved in theater which i'm not
<START> this is a sad film made for sad people i was sitting in theaters tearing my hair apart wanting to break the chairs in front of me as the movie spitted out one cringe inducing scenes after another and there were people roaring with laughter behind me which made me wonder what kind of films these people must be watching to actually enjoy this horse s t br br nikkhil advani has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters the screenplay is dull probably he was drunk when he was writing this film there is no strong hold on any of these stories nothing new nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before one of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it i mean seriously is this story really required its not funny not creative but only proves that advani has no sense of comedy another of the stories which was probably the only story i was interested in is based on a man's infidelity and that too ends in a lame age old sati savitri pati parmeshwar crap i have no idea what the salmaan priyanka plot was all about there was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot she can't take karan johar's film because she has to marry salmaan why can't she marry him and still take the film or does advani and priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married with six actors in the film obviously advani cant produce the film all by himself so he makes full use of sponsors like the times group shamelessly promoting their filmfare magazines and also some jewelery brand which the women in the film absolutely seem to adore i come to imdb to give it the worst rating and i am shocked to see posts praising the film it just goes to show the sad state of bollywood and how star struck the fans are with fans like these movies like salaam e ishq will be continue to be made and worse probably be a hit
<START> another comment about this film made it sound lousy given talking pictures were so new i think the script and acting were good davis was so young and fresh she had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect yet it is great to see her this way still learning the craft br br so many clichÃ©s came from this film and it seems this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years my vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight i love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments
