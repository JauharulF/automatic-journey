<START> i was going through a list of oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat butch cassidy and the sundance kid for best picture in 1969 after actually seeing it however i'm not surprised anymore it was way ahead of its time in regards to its style cinematography and use of flashback to help develop joe buck's character br br the most amazing thing to me is the depth of joe buck's character in such a short movie i think voight captured the naivete and the viciousness when provoked the two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him i think when he looks in the mirror he's trying to see if it's really him that has done or is about to do something terrible br br i think it was a brilliant decision by hoffman to take this role otherwise he may have been typecast after the graduate anyway this considered an all time great for a reason
<START> if you are a fan of really bad movies and you think there funny you will the great acting of shaq first off putting pro players in movies hardly ever works shaq had to of been the worst actor i have ever seen next to dennis rodman who also made a few bad movies well any way this movie is also bad due to the hideous kid i would give this a zero but that is impossible
<START> similar to on the town this musical about sailors on shore leave falls short of the later classic in terms of pacing and the quality of the songs but it has its own charms kelly has three fabulous dance routines one with jerry the cartoon mouse of tom and jerry fame one with a little girl and a fantasy sequence where he is a spanish lover determined to reach his lady on a high balcony sinatra playing kelly's shy inexperienced buddy and grayson the woman who serves as the love interest for both men do most of the singing iturbi provides some fine piano playing at nearly two and half hours it is a bit too long for a light musical but it doesn't drag
<START> that seem to be fooling people into seeing qualities in this film that are just not there br br near dark covered the same territory but with much more class and action br br why the script kept their 'big secret' so long was a total mystery to me i guessed it at the breakfast scene at the start of the film by the time it was revealed to the viewer it was just a case of 'big deal tell me something i don't know ' br br i found this to be pointless movie that may have challenged the genre conventions unfortunately those conventions are that horror films are tense and packed with genuine sense of horror this was woeful
<START> if alien jurassic park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea add a lot of sugar and you'll get this one down the film begins in jolly old england around 1100ad and then jumps to present day california our hero carver dean cain is the new security chief and military advisor for a science lab 400 feet underground he arrives carver is also a helicopter pilot with the lead scientist and we soon find out it's a cloning lab and they have something newly found to clone is it a dinosaur or what as with the above movies all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting picked off the special effects on the monster are pretty good for a direct to video movie and dean cain does what he gets paid for but forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before again don't go in with high expectations and you'll be ok
<START> a surprisingly complex and well crafted study of the first serial killer in the ussr set in the days of perestroika this intense piece is brought to full life with the performances of stephen reah and donald sutherland br br this examination of cicatillo as a killer is well rounded and by hinting at some of his behaviors while out right showing others there is a subtlety that is compelling without being overtly graphic not for the weak of heart however as it's subject matter is often disturbing but necessary to it's full development of the main participants in this fact based story br br hbo has furnished us with an excellent film in an unusual manner congrats to the director and editor of this great piece it is in my top 10 must see list
<START> this was a movie about infidelity and revenge a twin with the twin connection senses that something is wrong with her sister this movie took forever to establish the plot a plot that has been done many times the acting was lousy for the most part once the plot comes together the movie ends laura and ashley are twins that live with an abusive father the father seems to favor ashley so laura gets the blame for everything there is a promise made that the girls would never be apart but as they grow up their lives go in different directions ashley gets a job in a diner where she meets barry a married man of course no good can come of this the fact that barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to track him down i kept waiting for this movie to get better and for there to be some resolution somewhere but it never happened
<START> my friend had the idea of watching the animated lotr after seeing the peter jackson return of the king so i finally bought it off e bay thinking right from the start it was going to suck actually it really wasn't as bad as i thought it would be the animation was good for its time they used a unique method of blending live action with animation to create some interesting effects and the guy who did the voice for frodo sounded somewhat like elijah wood br br not the greatest adaptation of a book but trust me i've seen a lot worse it skips quite a lot of things since both fellowship and the two towers are compressed into one two hour movie definatley worth a watch kids might like but still absoutley no comparision with the peter jackson trilogy
<START> in a year of pretentious muck like synecdoche new york a film born out of charlie kaufman's own self indulgence comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important frownland is a labor of love by the crew the actors and the filmmaker shot over years by friends it traces a man who cannot communicate through his thoroughly authentic real brooklyn world the people that you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the mumblecore movement they are real people painfully trapped in their own self contained neuroses unwilling to change unable the real world to them is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch it is very difficult to watch it is 16mm film making without proper light money or any of the other factors that would make a film slick but its honesty can not be understated a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for richard linklater to give it an award as he did at sxsw this does remind of films like naked or the best of the mumblecore it is a film that is not for everyone but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it
<START> needed an excuse to get out of the house while paint dried left the movie after an hour to return and watch the paint dry br br i don't recall ever walking out on a movie before but i really tried to stay the script was not up to the cast and just kept going and going badly come on uma thurman doing this stuff fairly lame special effects these were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20 something lives just sort of annoying and wrong feeling br br this review is base only on the first hour it might have gotten better i just had to get home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went on
<START> believe it or not at 12 minutes this film for 1912 is a full length film very very few films were longer than that back then but that is definitely not what sets this odd little film apart from the rest no what's different is that all the actors with the exception of one frog are bugs yes bugs this simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of chaplin laurel and hardy or max linder but instead this russian production uses bugs or i think models that looked just like bugs chaplin and laurel and hardy were yet to be discovered and i assume linder was busy so perhaps that's why they used bugs using stop motion the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well and a heck of a lot more realistically than king kong 21 years later br br the film starts with mr beetle sneaking off for a good time he goes to a bawdy club while his wife supposedly waits at home but unfortunately for mr beetle he is caught on camera by a local film buff plus he doesn't know it but mrs beetle is also carrying on with a bohemian grasshopper painter of course there's a lot more to this domestic comedy than this but the plot is age old and very entertaining for adults and kids alike br br weird but also very amazing and watchable
<START> this is the kind of movie you regret you put in your vcr it is some weird bad rip off version of stephen kings movie misery 1990 i cannot understand how this movie got a 5 2 score because it has no story what so ever and when the movie finally ended i was relieved br br this movie should have been released as a short movie instead to much time is spent on the same thing and as in every bad movie everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10 15 minutes time span br br so before you decide to watch this movie be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control because you are going to do whole lot of fast forwarding don't worry you wont miss anything important
<START> obvious attack on microsoft made by people who don't appear to understand intellectual property or market economies generally br br loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of bill gates and is a cartoonish corporate villain ordering murders right and left br br while microsoft may engage in some anticompetitive activity at times it's unlikely they actually murder people therefore the film is over the top and ridiculous from the beginning br br the deeper point is apparently that major tech innovations should be free to the public and not subject to intellectual property laws however this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed if not for the market incentives and rewards provided by intellectual property br br it's one thing to be opposed to anti competitive conduct that's common sense it's quite another to be opposed to market competition in the first place which is what the film's mantra knowledge belongs to mankind represents br br yet another example of hollywood being completely out of touch with reality
<START> this film is horrible bad acting bad writing bad music it's just horrible not only is it incredibly misrepresentative of role playing games but the key elements of the film are poorly executed may the god i don't believe in have mercy on the souls of the miserable wretches who conceived and gave birth to this abomination
<START> i really enjoyed the pilot it was as amazing as i hoped it would be if not better patrick warburton was a riot although at first i thought that i wouldn't be able to stand his character him and megyn price had little chemistry at all but hopefully as the season goes on they'll get more comfortable around each other it must have been weird for megyn to go from being the star on her last show grounded for life to being a co star br br bianca kajlich and oliver hudson seem really new to the whole sitcom scene but i think in time they'll get better david spade's character to my surprise wasn't the whole focus of this pilot the way he delivers his lines is so different from anyone else i've ever seen on tv but i think that it is just his style it works for him br br i think that couples or even singles will be able to relate to all the doubts and fights and being unsure about your decisions that this show is about all the situations that the characters are put in just feel like real life not sugar coated like most shows br br i hope for all the actors sakes that cbs gives them a chance this show has the potential to be one of the best series if just given the chance and time
<START> wow this is the worst movie ever the only reason i signed up for imdb was so i could complain about this movie i have never walked out of a theater or stoped a dvd but i almost stopped this one and i should have but i watched it all the way to the end just to get let down again with an absolutely terrible ending wow if this is all that wes craven can produce his time is long up i've never seen the first one and will never after watching this its terrible acting with a terrible plot hey looks someone is shinning a mirror at us lets go check it out and the sad part is that when this movie came to dvd it was completely checked out at blockbuster forever so i feel bad for all the people that saw this junk
<START> this is an amazing movie from 1936 although the first hour isn't very interesting for the modern viewer the stylish vision of the year 2036 that comes afterwords makes up for it however don't plan on being able to understand all of the dialog the sound quality and accents it's american but 1930s american make it difficult br br basically the story is a sweeping 100 year look at a fictional us town called everytown it spans from 1936 when a war is on the horizon to 2036 when technology leaps forward and creates its own problems br br the first one hour is a bit slow although it's tough to tell what audiences back then would have thought the events suspense and visuals are pretty low key in today's terms however when it gets to the future it's just plain fun to watch the large sets and retro sci fi look of everything is hard to beat br br unless you have great listening abilities this movie is hard to listen to i think i understood only 80 of the dialog it could use closed captioning br br if you're a sci fi fan this is one of the genre's classics and is a must see well at least after the first hour for the average viewer wait until there's a closed caption version and then watch it if you're comfortable with movies of this time period
<START> in the opening scene the eye patch wearing desperado named hawkeye has a smooth forehead but when he follows johnny into the pueblo he's shown with a scar over his patched eye that's just one of the many continuity lapses in this edgy 'spaghetti' western but rather than detract from the picture it adds a special flavor to the proceedings br br another occurs when sanchez turns in his three dead bodies they have to be examined for their identities you just can't imagine how many false cadavers we have in our town immediately after carradine lawrence dobkin shows up to collect his bounty with no more than a wanted poster in hand br br as for the film's principal johnny yuma mark damon he's shown with his holster alternately on his right and left hip throughout the movie after exchanging gun belts with carradine following the barroom brawl johnny's bound for san margo at his uncle's request but will have to avenge his death at the hands of deceitful wife samantha rosalba neri and her conniving brother pedro louis vanner it takes some time getting there but it's a fun ride with one of the best music scores on record as for that saloon fight i got a kick out of the kung fu sound effects every time a punch connected br br care for some more story exaggerations following the duel with pedro the first time johnny wipes a small amount of blood from his lip which he manages to smear pedro's entire face with similarly when pedro smacks around little pepe later in the film he doesn't cut him but by the time johnny arrives pepe's face is covered with blood br br johnny yuma is probably one of the best of the genre that doesn't have clint eastwood in it as johnny mark damon is a reasonably suitable stand in but without the seething exterior carradine seemed to be a replacement for the obligatory lee van cleef character without being a total bad guy at first the identity exchange between carradine and johnny didn't seem to make sense but it all tied together by the time the film ended you knew each henchman would wind up getting his due marking time for each was part of the anticipation br br in case you're wondering the title hero has nothing to do with the nick adams character from the classic tv western the rebel in this film johnny got his name from a gunfight he had in yuma once br br perhaps the most unique element of the story had to do with the way it tied things up with the evil samantha who pulled the strings behind the scenes throughout after shooting carradine she beats a hasty retreat before johnny can get his revenge still alive it looks like carradine tries to shoot her and misses but it doesn't take long for johnny and sanchez to track her into the dessert where she perished without water carradine aimed for her canteen
<START> basically the exact same movie as house of wax vincent price's first genuine horror hit released the previous year but seriously who cares because the mad magician offers just as many sheer thrills delightful period set pieces joyous 3 d effects sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor never change a winning team is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down price's character don gallico another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history entitled the girl and the buzz saw gallico's promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose stating that all of gallico's inventions are the rightful property of the company the sleazy and relentless ormond who by the way also ransacked gallico's once beloved wife takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallico's rival the great rinaldi inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond but Â also being a master of creating disguises Â recreates his victim's image and even starts leading a double life the mad magician is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50's horror movie in grand guignol style with a whole lot of improbably plot twists the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross out moments although they obviously remain suggestive for most part the 3 d delights near the beginning of the film like a yo yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains merely just serve as time filler and contemporary 50's hype but it's still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them the mad magician is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in like no other actor could ever accomplish price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way you pity don gallico yet at the same time you fear him enormously you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death vincent price simply was a genius actor and in my humble opinion the embodiment of the horror genre
<START> this movie was physically painful to sit through maybe because like many people my age and younger i grew up with dr seuss and loved his books funny clever whimsical and subversive at the same time the cat in the hat sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story and mike myer's performance as the cat is mostly bewildering why the borscht belt accent the unfunny patter the inappropriate jokes the charmless costume i had to go back and re read the books to see the real problem the books are simple this movie is overblown and way way too long br br you don't expect every kids' movie to be toy story or the iron giant but this one set a new low how could mike myers need the money
