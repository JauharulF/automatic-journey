<START> i didn't really go into reign over me knowing exactly what to expect either from the director or the story the plot was easy enough to understand i suppose this guy's whole family died in 9 11 and he shuts the world out of his life alright i didn't know if it was going to use the attachment of terrorism as a platform to speak on that or other issues relating to it and it really doesn't on a very obvious level so if you're scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours i wouldn't worry about it i think the writing even made a point never to explicitly mention september the eleventh br br overall i was impressed it was a very moving picture the movie has a sense of humor and it is very sharp but it is definitely a drama where it counts i typically don't like to think that comedic actors are incapable of actually acting but sometimes let's be honest they are adam sandler is definitely capable of it and though i think so you may disagree jim carrey is also very well rounded sometimes sandler's portrayal of charlie fineman took a character that on the surface seems completely unreal and makes it become absolutely believable i read many reviews that criticized the writing of alan johnson's don cheadle in another excellent role if not one that seems similar to a few of his more recent pictures wife who is played well by jada pinkett smith calling her static and dull but that is completely untrue br br she has depth but some of it gets hidden behind the main story which does drift in and out of focus occasionally which also brings to mind some very unusual transitions done early in the movie with a weird make everything out of focus fadeout after about the first 40 minutes they aren't used anymore maybe it's significant for the characters outlook artistically or maybe they just realized how irritating it was the film gradually begins to reveal to us the point one of several but definitely the most explicit of the story which is that sometimes people have to deal with grief in their own way maybe it seems unorthodox to us maybe it seems downright unhealthy but maybe what some people want more than anything is just to forget to just exist the films soundtrack was excellent and it used music to pursue and amplify moods rather than establish them which gives credit to the actors and the writers br br the movie takes it's name from the song love reign o'er me off of the who's rock opera quadrophenia the song itself is fairly insignificant to the actual story but it is used powerfully in the movie over the course of the climax and at the very end the movie is paced well and does not feel like it's dragging anywhere in it's length which is a little over 2 hours if you can accept adam sandler's portrayal of this deeply heartbroken and broken down man you will enjoy the movie you will become entangled in the story and you will genuinely feel for the characters in every minute of it it is not the best movie of the year and there's nothing groundbreaking or positively amazing in it but it's a very enjoyable watchable movie all in all
<START> saying a film is depressing isn't necessarily a bad thing i'm very willing to watch a depressing film if there is a point to be made and this one certainly has one it's the often heartbreaking story of a chinese man and his family as they experience many years of both hardship and plenty but i must warn you that this might just be about the most depressing film to come out of hollywood in the 1930s because peasant life in china was tough to say the least be prepared to watch segments about famine death and disease br br about the only negative other than the persistent tone of misery is that the lead is played by paul muni while he was an exceptionally talented man it's just a real shame that hollywood always cast people of european descent to play asian leads during this era if you are paying attention at all it's pretty obvious that muni is wrong for the part
<START> i stumbled upon nine dead recently and read the current reviews thinking i could deal with an average movie this movie however was slightly below average yet watchable the script was poorly written and the acting was at average for a b level movie with a couple standing out as pretty good the plot borders on that of saw teach people what they did wrong in a situation and try to make them appreciate life more but that is really where the comparison ends nine dead tries to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new the main fault that i found in nine dead was the slap in the face to the viewer of flashbacks that occurred 3 minutes before in the film and were completely unnecessary and a completely inadequate ending that people won't see coming in a bad way barring any spoilers i have seen the worse of bad movies and even they didn't end this poorly decent flick bad acting and ending though
<START> i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in 1969 it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x of course at that time x meant maturity since i was only two years old at the time of the movie's release it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then however when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film which included prostitution the title itself was slang for a male prostitute homosexuality loneliness physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release it is worth noting that in the 1970's midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r some of the scenes could almost be rated pg 13 by today's standards br br i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women after being rejected by all the women he has come across he meets a sleazy con man named enrico ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager once again joe is conned and before long is homeless however joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment without giving away much more of the plot i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams i e joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health br br i want to make some comments about the movie itself first of all the acting is excellent especially the leads although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes in fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny i find them amusing for example there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey i'm walkin' here i'm walkin' here i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman sends joe jon voight to a guy named o'daniel what is amusing is that at first we think o'daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o'daniel is nothing but a religious nut in addition to the two scenes i mentioned i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in self defense john wayne you gonna tell me he's a fag what i like is the delivery in that scene br br i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late '60's much of it rings true today that's because although the area around 42nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago also many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character one thing that impresses me about jon voight's character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie he had matured a great deal and that ratso dustin hoffman's character was a good influence on him br br in conclusion i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on for example there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings also what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck jon voight's character and the people who were in his life in texas even the ending while i don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie is rather open ended
<START> ok i caught this film halfway through but oh dear god it sounds like they're all reading from scripts br br especially that guy who is now in teachers and the book group although at least he has proved that he can act if he wants to the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad film making both in terms of acting scripting and general plausibility it quite clearly appears to be a cash in on human traffic but whilst that is not the best film ever it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of earnest yet hopeless gcse students trying to get a pass grade not so much as human traffic as a bit of a car crash
<START> can we say retarded this girl has no talent what so ever nothing but complete garbage you people are just marking 10 stars because you know most people hate this pathetic woman if its such a great show then why did it get canceled after 6 measly episodes exactly people that support her please seek help you do not know what is funny her stand up comedy is just so stupid seriously how do you find this trash funny the show tries to poke fun at stereo types and other things that are not funny at all carlos mencia is funny and to that stupid poster he actually has fans and his show is on the air so i'm sorry your a redneck who doesen't get his jokes please give me my 20 minutes of my life back
<START> for 50 years after world war 2 the united states was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests at the same time because of the draft and wars everyone in society had served or was connected to someone who had br br this allowed for a minigenre based on the notion of american cleverness in the midst of an inflexible military machine sometimes that machine was non us military for example in prisoner of war situations once removed are stories in other machines science fiction and corporate but they always reference this military genre and indeed the testosterone shots of action even reference their comic sibling br br you can trace it i think perhaps starting in the comic meaning amrican sections of the great escape which immediately spawned teevee offspring in gomer pyle and hogan's heros then a second wave triggered by catch 22 and mash both of which had been real life then books then movies and in the mash case then teevee br br but before all that there was the phil silvers show about a sergeant bilko and this followed from mister roberts a happy con man who only committed harmless crimes and then only as response to an overly crude system which attempted to limit his life this was in the day when teevee shows mattered you absorbed them instead of merely carrying them to work to chatter about it wasn't particularly clever in any way except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom br br its one large zone where americans worked out how they think about forgivable even endearing lies in a military context a zone that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here br br because its big it sometimes pays off in laughs stripes was pretty darn funny i thought it had the twist of the misfits actually defeating serious foes sort of folding in some dirty dozen and sexual adventure br br now this well before the cultural wars escalated it tries to touch that sweet spot like other remakes that manhandled steve martin it is so unfunny you actually root for the army to be the stronger player yet another way to track how societies work out the handles on military power br br ted's evaluation 1 of 3 you can find something better to do with this part of your life
<START> i have seen about a thousand horror films my favorite type this film is among the worst for me an idea drives a movie so even a poorly acted cheaply made movie can be good something weird is definitely cheaply made however it has little to say i still don't understand what the karate scene in the beginning has to do with the film something weird has little to offer save yourself the pain
<START> this movie is really funny the general is keaton's finest work but there are many of his works that are more hilarious in this one are multiple sight gags and creative humor we watch it over and over and it only seems to get funnier
<START> not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts br br makeup that a child can do acting was over done poor directing editing was very choppy many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous sound was badly dubbed music was highly inappropriate casting was extremely off must have been on crack zombies that talk let alone drive dance work just pisses me off and the bad guy holy crap as horribly casted as he was he was the best looking zombie of all which doesn't say much br br the cover art was good but very deceiving as was the main menu of the dvd great artwork and music br br don t bother
<START> reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high a big budget tons of popular faces a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves the end result is a disaster alice tremblay's supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain it's audience i didn't hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation going through it's page thin story line and one dimensional characters without a single spark not a sign of the magic it wished it had the 90 minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly couldn't seem that great an idea on the set let alone on paper 'l'odyssÃ©e d'alice tremblay' is a collage of comic sketches linked together with a very thin layer of good ideas avoid or boredom will haunt you
<START> this was a great movie that had a lot of under lying issues it dealt with issues of rascism and class but it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself this movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny it also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society what others think of you is not important i believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it the actors i think were able to convey each character wonderfully i just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was at a just glancing look you wouldn't see how deep the movie is but on further look you see the underlining meaning of the movie
<START> ugh what can i say other than ugh i rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original vampires this movie could not have been any lamer lacking not only in plot but the acting is atrocious combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch many times i questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark here's a sampling of the lamer aspects br br spoilers br br professional slayer insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night he wakes up to a woman crying sitting no more than 3 feet from him in the middle of nowhere he immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance she goes from crying to seducing him and he lets it happen with obvious results br br one of the main characters is zoe was bitten by a vampire but as long as she takes these experimental pills she got in mexico city she's fine although her body temperature is below room temperature br br guard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires hero leaves the next day he then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left br br avoid this movie
<START> i'm not sure under what circumstances director visconti decided to film james cain's novel the postman always rings twice i'm not even sure if viscounti acquired the book's rights but the resulting movie is definitely interesting it is not the best version of cain's story i like the 1981 version best but thanks to visconti's excellent direction and the casting of clara calamai and massimo girotti a very sensual couple it is a must for noir fans visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect the film is not perfect though my main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good the story moves at a very slow pace i don't think visconti was very good at editing his films i think film noir works better with a short running time fortunately calamai and girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested anyhow as much as i like this film and the remakes i think no one has made the definitive version of cain's much praised book
<START> kate beckinsale is as good if not better than gwyneth paltrow as emma in this movie although i really liked gwyneth paltrow in the other emma version they're both good in different ways kate beckinsale as emma seems more interesting almost though and i liked the woman who played harriet smith in this movie better too she was more believably sweet and sentimental there are certain things i like better about the gwyneth paltrow version though like how the humorous side is more apparent
<START> this movie barely followed the story line of the movie all of the fascinating points in the book didn't even exist in the movie they ended up turning it into a cheesy tween disney movie crush story between meg and calvin it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part or one of the likes this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book i can't believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap basic rendition if you've ever read the book i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of lord of the rings equivalence this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time poorly done
<START> of all the kung fu films made through the 70's and 80's this is one that has developed a real cult following with the exception of all the films bruce lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story an aging kung fu master tells his last pupil yang tieh sheng chiang about five pupils he has trained in the past all five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently their specialty in kung fu is the name they have adopted like lizard snake centipede toad and scorpion the master called them the poison clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil an old man who was once a member of the poison clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are tieh has discovered that the snake is hung wen tung pai wei and along with tang sen kue feng lu who is the centipede they kill a family to find the map a map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the scorpion but know one knows who he is a local policeman named ho yung sin philip kwok investigates the murders along with his partner ma chow chien sun sin has a friend called li ho meng lo who is the toad and they do know of each others identity the snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on li ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed when sin finds out he teams up with tieh and together they go to combat tung and kue br br this film was directed by cheh chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films chang was not your run of the mill kung fu director and his films always had a special quality to them while most martial arts films deal with revenge chang did not use that as a central theme even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of changs stories were in a class all by themselves i wouldn't exactly put it in the same league as enter the dragon because bruce lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking this film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isn't necessarily about fight scenes its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved that alone makes this different from all the other kung fu films very well made with a unique story
<START> this movie was one of the funniest movie i've seen in years and the laughs from the audience members support me not since my big fat greek wedding 2002 has the laughter been as spontaneous and intense easily has intricate as last year's mr and mrs smith 2005 in its use of parody espionage in mr and mrs smith and sex in my super ex girlfriend director's ivan reitman balance between comedy and drama between crazy and downright ludicrous is great never does the shock and dramatic serious crack the rule of comedy at the same time this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements even if the ending is broadcast in advance in some ways it's so evident that it's great to see how it plays out just like in real life sometimes the truth is so evident that one can't really see it easily eight out of ten stars ranking up there with tootsie 1982 possibly a nine depends on how it appears on a second viewing
<START> after witnessing his wife linda hoffman engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy the already somewhat unstable dentist dr feinstone corbin bernsen completely snaps which means deep trouble for his patients br br this delightful semi original and entertaining horror flick from director brian yuzna was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late nineties although Âthe dentist' is intended to be a cheesy fun little film yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days the movie is intriguing generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest even during the more ludicrous of moments Âthe dentist' suffers on occasion from dragging but unlike the much inferior 1998 sequel there are only sporadic uninteresting moments and in general the movie follows itself nicely br br corbin bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic deranged and perfectionist dr alan feinstone the way bernsen is able to credibly recite his lines especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex particularly fellatio is something short of marvellous while many actors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable had Âthe dentist' not been intended to be a fun almost comical horror movie bernsen's performance would probably have been much more powerful sadly the rest of the cast including a pre fame mark ruffalo failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flick br br Âthe dentist' is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable particularly i would presume for fans of cheesy horror those who became annoyed at the number of Âscream' 1996 clones from the late nineties may very well find this a refreshing change as i did a seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make Âthe dentist' one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the 1990's on top of this we are presented with some particularly grizly and on the whole realistic scenes of dental torture which should keep most gorehounds happy far from perfect but far from bad as well Âthe dentist' is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once my rating for Âthe dentist' Â 6 5 10
<START> i wouldn't give this movie a rating it's not worthy i watched it only because i'm a pfieffer fan i love her and would watch anything she made even in this dud she didn't disappoint every scene with her in it kept the viewer watching waiting for something to happen but nothing ever did it had some good story lines but they ended abruptly as soon as it started some of the other characters had potential but nothing became of it br br pfieffer was 29 when she made this film and at her most lovely the wardrobe and set was surprisingly good br br i can watch mostly anything and rarely come across a movie i can't find something to like about it but this was a dud i don't understand br br the worst thing about it all it had a big cliff hanger at the end it had an ending scene that woke you up and say wow this film is finally going some place then the credits roll good grief br br i agree with the review that said 99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting well said actually that comment was more entertaining than the film because it sums it up so well i too wasted 99 cents on this dud dud dud
