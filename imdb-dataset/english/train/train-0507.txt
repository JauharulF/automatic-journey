<START> mst 3000 should do this movie it is the worst acted movie i have ever seen first of all you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in 1993 and pays his rent in cash there is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job also the head of security for the pothus would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a haze if the president was shot this movie sucked i cannot express the extremite that this movie was every single actor was terrible even the chick at the trailer park i crap on this garbage what a waste of time
<START> by rights there should never have been a first blood part ii the original script for first blood had john rambo committing suicide at the end of the film but this was changed to allow him to live not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but because test audiences found the original ending too depressing nevertheless someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the eighties plus the recently released fourth instalment br br the official title of this film was rambo first blood part ii but it is more commonly known simply as rambo it starts with the title character in jail where he is presumably expiating the crimes he committed in first blood although this is never made too explicit he is removed from prison by his former commanding officer colonel trautman for a secret mission rambo is to return to vietnam to investigate reports that american pows are still being held captive by the communist regime he is under strict instructions not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy his is to be simply a fact finding mission br br what rambo does not realise is that he is being set up not by trautman who is portrayed as brave honourable and incorruptible but by the organiser of the mission a military bureaucrat named murdock murdock intends that the mission will prove that there are no american prisoners in vietnam partly because that will improve relationships between the american and vietnamese governments partly because it will make his own life easier unfortunately for murdock rambo discovers that not only are americans still being held prisoner they are also being kept in hellish conditions of course he is far too much of a hero to leave them to their fate and tries to rescue them the rest of the film is more or less one long battle between rambo and a few allies including a beautiful vietnamese girl and the evil commie soldiers and their russian allies most of the evil commies of course end up dead although i was surprised to learn from your trivia section that the total death toll was as low as 67 at times it seemed as though rambo was trying to wipe out the entire vietnamese army br br the tone of this film is very different from the first in first blood rambo was unquestionably a criminal even though his responsibility for his crimes was lessened by severe provocation and by his mental instability in rambo he is a bona fide all american hero a few years earlier the director george pan cosmatos had made the cassandra crossing a biased piece of left wing anti american propaganda cosmatos however was nothing if not versatile and rambo proves that he could also turn his hand to biased right wing pro american propaganda the one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably bad br br first blood had its faults but it also had its virtues its stance that the anti war movement was partly to blame for the problems faced by vietnam vets in readjusting to civilian life was a controversial one but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war social attitudes to war and the roots of violence in society rambo by contrast has very few virtues except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like that sort of thing it is essentially a sort of jingoistic revenge fantasy for those americans who were still sore about the vietnam war rambo re fights the war single handed and this time the right side wins take that charlie cong br br by this point no doubt the film's admirers and there seem to be plenty more than 2 000 voters have already given it ten stars will have concluded that i am a liberal commie loving pinko far from it in fact i have always despised communism as a pernicious ideology what i dislike about the film is not its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems including ideological disputes is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill as many people as possible it makes no attempt to understand the political complexities of south east asia or why not everyone in the region was pro american for all its anti communism the film is the sort of moronic sledgehammer propaganda that the communists were very good at churning out themselves except that they attributed all the world's problems to capitalism or imperialism or revisionism or whatever other ism they had taken a dislike to compared to rambo the green berets was a masterly piece of political analysis 3 10
<START> i cannot say that aag is the worst bollywood film ever made because i haven't seen every bollywood film but my imagination tells me that it could well be br br this film seems like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director and i for one be believe he has been successful in his mission no a list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humiliation this film is bound to carry with it br br but lets not just blame the director here there is the cinematographer who looks like he's rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year award there is the over dramatic score that hopes to carry you to the next scene the lighting man who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light bulb on pole in the other and hoping that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene and of course the actors some of them are by no means newcomers else all could be forgiven here the ensemble of actors in aag were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re make of india's most loved movie of all time 'sholay' one must not forget that these actors were not forced in to this film they are a list and willing participants to something that let's face it would surely have had high and eager public expectation so it begs the question amitabh aside for now did the other actors really believe their performances even attempted to better the original did amitabh bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of a film don't be stupid of course he didn't this was a demonstration to the public of how much money talks hence can make actors walk br br i truly hope everyone involved is satisfied with what is truly a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film which only succeeds in polluting everyone's mind when they watch the original
<START> i am very sorry that this charming and whimsical film which i first saw soon after it was first released in the early fifties has had such a poor reception more recently in my opinion it has been greatly underrated but perhaps it appeals more to the european sense of humour than to for example the american maybe we in europe can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations more since we are closer to some of them in real life particular mention should be made of the limited but good music especially the catchy and memorable song it's a fine fine night which was issued separately on an hmv 78rpm record 10 inch plum label i think in the fifties i would urge anyone interested to give it a try if you get the chance you may have a pleasant surprise
<START> i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way i felt that the script was conveying all the things i feel physically and emotionally when i got home from work and watched it this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format br br holy guacamole how i wish those days would come again i tried putting a bubble window on the side of my car honda civic 1984 but the vacuum formed muffin trays didn't quite cut it also in my civic sexual positions are limited and are not supported by water bed as is brilliantly depicted in 'the van' br br 'the van' is of the utmost side splitting hilarity and can even substitute for porn if you watch some scenes privately br br i highly anticipate that sam grossman the director has achieved his opus br br ratings john 1 2 sam
<START> director paul verhoeven's american vehicles are of varied quality but most of the films he made in his native country are indisputable masterworks this is the story of alcoholic and bi sexual writer who moves in with a beautiful rich and very strange woman but the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the woman's handsome male lover in the meantime the writer is plagued with strange visions at first they look like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse but he soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of premonitions fascinating hitchcockian thriller very original and provocative i love films that make you think they are about something but then you realize they are about something completely different this is one of those movies a thriller during the first half and a quasi religious surrealist saga during the second half very erotic original and blasphemous not for kids or people that go to church every sunday great cinematography by future director jan de bont highly reommended
<START> if you haven't seen this you do not know what you are missing the first time you do you will litteraly be in pain lying on floor throwing up from laughing so hard and having probably wet yourself as well br br it is that funny there hasn't been a single comedic performance to this date that i have seen that tops this or even comes close so many classic one liners stories and segways br br the drunken uncle at the bbq gi joe mr t goony goo goo ice cream man you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and i'll bet you dollars to doughnuts they will not be able to keep a straight face and will burst out in laughter or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act br br pure classic shame you can't get it on dvd br br rating 10 out of 10
<START> not that all disney films are garbage br br anyway i saw legend of boggy creek first and absolutely loved the film when i heard it had 2 sequels i was ecstatic i finally found a copy of this and watched it one night i don't see how they can make a g rated sequel to a horror film the original is a movie documentary about the fauke monster and can scare anyone return is for kids and should not be watched by anyone i don't remember the plot too well as it's been quite some time since i watched it and i will not watch it again but it's about these hunters coming to town and they go looking to kill bigfoot three little kids sneek out of the house to stop them a big monsoon comes through the hunters get hurt are saved by the kids then they all hide out in a boat with a big piece of tarp on top and try to wait out the storm then all of a sudden bigfoot comes and does something really sick i don't wanna ruin the ending for any of yas but it's not scary well
<START> this film was in one word amazing i have only seen it twice and have been hunting it everywhere a beautiful ensemble of older screen gems who still have that energy judy denchs ability to carry the whole film was amazing her subtle chemistry with the knight in stolen armour was great
<START> now admittedly i'm no ardent student of the genre as a matter of fact i've tended always to shy away from westerns because in spite of all their critical cachet as america's primal stories or whatever they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either shoot up the injuns the big gunfight or hey let's form a posse in other words it always seemed to me a genre so rooted in and tied to convention that it left precious little room for surprise or originality and yes i have seen at least some of the so called greats and unapologetically lump them into this negative assessment including stagecoach rio bravo my darling clementine and of course the infamous but profoundly dull clint eastwood sergio leone teamups in the '60s br br but when i saw this movie on tv as part of a commemorative jimmy stewart weekend upon his death i finally got it i understood at least in theory what the western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation aside from just action and thrills it is the push pull between lawlessness and order the american west represented freedom but also the prospect of the wild the untamed respectable folk could get hurt out there which of course meant that perhaps just perhaps it wasn't meant for respectable folk and that the only residents should be the amoral and the shifty those who dispensed justice strictly from the barrel of their revolvers and where kill or be killed would ever be the law of the land in such an environment of course the true heroes are the ones who are ornery and free spirited enough to be out there in the first place and so reject society at least as it manifested itself on the eastern seaboard and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just is not right catching and examining that disparity between law and disorder in the main character himself is i believe after seeing this movie the highest and truest goal of any western sadly it is so often not the case as the white hats are completely white the black ones completely black and let's not even get started talking about the indians ok and there is precious little shades of gray in between br br not in this one jimmy stewart plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of miners before him into the alaskan wilderness to prospect for gold he is joined in this by his lifelong buddy played by walter brennan perhaps the western clichÃ© character to end them all but nevertheless enjoyable here as always and no one else pointedly they are out for themselves and while stewart displays his patented charm come on we could never really dislike the guy now could we we are left with little doubt that his is basically a self centered self interested character none of his gosh or oh golly gee humanism is allowed to come through or rather it has to be earned by the end of the picture in the way i described above he must confront the lawlessness in himself and weigh it against the need for order and justice which are so blatantly lacking in the border town which serves as the miners' starting point on their gold dust trail this town is ruled tightly by its wicked sheriff mr gannon played by john mcintire in one of the best bad guy performances i've ever seen he comes on with so much charm and humor and has such a relaxed and interesting rapport with stewart that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he is the bad guy so that when it finally sinks in it does so with double force further by establishing a type of breezy if necessarily guarded camaraderie between mcintire and stewart the film plays up the notion of how close in temperament they really are and so how far a moral distance stewart must walk by the end of the film br br i won't go through all the twists and turns the plot takes see those for yourself as well as the rugged and gorgeous alaskan scenery filmed on location mind you not cheap painted stills that the studio made up what's key here is how much this story focuses upon character with great dialogue and character interaction substituting for gunplay much of the time although the film has just enough action and adventure to prevent it from ever being static read talky definitely one of the greatest performances i've seen from stewart showing he could play the renegade the man's man just as convincingly as the decent and upright guy next door if anything in fact his everyman qualities lend greater strength to his characterization making him seem less mythic or overblown like say eastwood or john wayne and more a three dimensional personage his relationship with brennan is well played understated but nevertheless touching with a faint suggestion of george and lenny from of mice and men an altogether different type of western br br i certainly have more westerns to see but this is for now my favorite and the yardstick by which i will necessarily judge all the others it deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is
<START> despite what the title may imply pigs is pigs does not star porky pig rather it features a young swine with an appetite more insatiable than john belushi's character in animal house his mother repeatedly scolds him but it does no good so much so that he goes to another house where a deranged scientist force feeds him more than any mere mortal can handle but there's a surprise at the end br br i would mostly say that this cartoon seemed like a place holder in between the really great cartoons daffy duck debuted three months after this came out but make no mistake about it they do some neat things here the whole force feeding sequence looks more relevant today given the obesity epidemic overtaking our country br br anyway not the greatest cartoon but worth seeing
<START> what is wrong with you people if you weren't blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head of course the film isn't a masterpiece i don't think it was aiming to be it was fun and funny i never watched the show when i was younger i only recently saw one episode and when i watched the movie i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere the movie seats were practically shaking and the car sequences were good because it didn't bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious and jessica simpson is plain hot i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences all in all i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd people enjoy it for what it is
<START> i saw this movie at the theaters when i was about 6 or 7 years old i loved it then and have recently come to own a vhs version br br my 4 and 6 year old children love this movie and have been asking again and again to watch it br br i have enjoyed watching it again too though i have to admit it is not as good on a little tv br br i do not have older children so i do not know what they would think of it br br the songs are very cute my daughter keeps singing them over and over br br hope this helps
<START> john rivers' life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been concluded dead after a freakish accident that involved changing a tyre on her car during the days she has been missing he confronts a man that's been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other side through e v p electronic voice phenomenon naturally he doesn't believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about e v p soon enough john is hooked onto it but something supernatural doesn't like him interfering with the dead as now other then contacting his wife the white noise is foretelling events before they happen br br since this dvd has been sitting on my shelf for a while now i thought i better get around to watching it since it wasn't my copy but then again i don't think the owners were in a hurry to get it back as they haven't question me about it oh well so i decided to give it a play as i was in an undemanding mood after hearing and reading all the bad press on it i wasn't expecting anything remotely good but i was kept entertained for 90 minutes well more so the 60 minutes as the last half an hour was pretty much a blur of confusion the film is nowhere as good as it could have been but the time breezed by quick enough even though it's a rather tepid supernatural thriller i thought it wasn't all a waste the first hour i found some effective sequences rather interesting and there's a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film that's when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just doesn't fit in with the context it becomes rather hectic loud and very muddled with its mtv style editing and kinetic camera work that gets to close into the action i couldn't understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax the whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey it's a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big but hits rock bottom i thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camera work other then the distinctively stark lighting the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy all of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware which makes it come across as very sterile and empty br br you can easily see that the film's heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story there's just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material after a while it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood curdling stuff from beyond the grave it just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy tv screen after while the e v p machine was the star on the show well it did have more impact than the limp performances michael keaton is more than capable actor but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed john rivers he really deserves much better though everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable not because of the performances but of the lack of depth in their characters this clunker wasn't bad to begin with but it does go pear shape by falling away drastically br br i wouldn't care to see it again and i wouldn't recommend to anyone unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of hollywood produced horror thrillers it's just a damn shame that this over produced flick couldn't put it together successfully as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand i didn't hate it but what a disappointment
<START> i was one of the few non liberals who showed up to see steve's video it was quite an experience in propaganda film making and boredom br br i was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of michael moore's visit to my local school uvsc but it turned out to be another liberal slash and burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community it sure seems self serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues br br what's more surprising is to see all the '10' votes his homeys have posted here did they even see the video golly gee batman this must rank with all the president's men their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film br br yeah like stacking the votes at imdb will help a lame movie maybe my vote will help balance this out
<START> this movie is a very realistic view of a police squad in a small german town as seen through the eyes of a woman recruit she brings her way of dealing with the law which means more than simple convictions the strong performance of the main character supported by good dialogues makes this flick very enjoyable
<START> all i can say is before watching the movie i did not have a hint indication who annemarie schwarzenbach was or what was her life story and i have to confess that the movie was hardly a help to reach these data and even it was not successful to persuade me to do some research by typing few words on google website however all i can say is that the actress jeanette hain was great with her mute facial expression she really played well and showed a deep depression mental status as it is in real br br after all based on the script the movie has happened in turkey and tehran as well as afghanistan but believe me i am familiar with the area it was all about an arabic desert in morocco turkish people and persian people are completely different in face and culture as well as in language which is not arabic br br i suppose for making a film like this documentary type a thorough research about all these minor elements is mandatory
<START> a true story about a true revolution 25 of april a revolution against a repressive regime of 41 years that was imposing a colonial war on it's military's for maintaining an empire angola mozambique guine bissau cabo verde s tomÃ© e principe the first and the last of the great colonial empire's of europe of 600 years since it's beginning in the conquest of ceuta in 1415 a revolution by the army for the people and for a democratic portugal the most's surprising fact in this revolution is that it were no people killed in it except those that died in the hand's of pide the political police of the state during a brutal gunfire against an unarmed crowd protesting in front of it's headquarters in the day of the revolution in 25 of april 1974 has it show's on the film and has all revolutions it has it's heroes one them of was captain salgueiro maia a returned soldier from the war whose convictions along with the rest of the army was that they were fighting since 1961 a hopeless war and that sometimes a soldier has to disobey it's country
<START> when rodney dangerfield is on a roll he's hilarious in my 5 wives he's not on a roll the timing of the one liners is off but they're the best thing going for the movie the five women who play the wives don't add up to one whole actress between them the plot is very weak even the premise is pretty weak there are a few jokes about having multiple wives but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie most of the movie could play the same way even if rodney's character had only one wife so the premise seems more like an old man's fantasy than a key part of the comedy another old man's fantasy we're supposed to accept that rodney's character is an athletic skier br br jerry stiller seems to be phoning in his role just to do a buddy a favor and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for work br br the odd nods to political correctness later in the movie don't really do anything for the movie for those who like their movies politically correct the non pc humor is still there in the first place and the seeming apologies for it still don't get the point for those who hate seeing a movie cave in to political correctness the pc add ins are just annoying digressions br br this has to be the mildest r rated movie i've ever seen there are some racy jokes and the bedroom scenes would have made shocking tv 40 years ago but that's about it maybe it was the topless men kidding br br the dvd features interviews where the cast members seem to find depth and importance in this movie and in their roles i kept wondering if they were serious or kidding they seem to be serious but i kept thinking they must be kidding there's also a peculiar disclaimer suggesting that since the movie never actually names the mormons or the church of latter day saints that somehow it's not about them never mind that the movie features a polygamous religion in utah and makes reference to brigham young br br in short my 5 wives was a disappointment i was hoping for rodney on a roll but the best i can say for the movie is that rodney was looking pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time
<START> a drama at its very core anna displays that genuine truth that all actors age and sometimes fade away anna is a character that believes america is her safety net her home and it can do her no wrong Â but she refuses to belittle herself to do work she doesn't believe in she is hard nosed optimistic stubborn and arrogant when it comes to her life yet not afraid to let others in yet drop them at a moments notice anna flip flops between personalities which makes this film ideal of an aging star but not idea of the viewing audience anna has been praised for its star sally kirkland and her ability to get grungy for the role but a month into 2008 anna does not remain a staple of film culture it is dated dull and formulaically chaotic br br director yurek bogayevicz has a message hidden within anna about the falsehoods of czechoslovakia both politically and socially but kirkland refuses to let them upstage her bogayevicz is not afraid to play with the camera to use wooden frames to allow kirkland to stand out and he is not afraid to lessen the surrounding characters so that when you walk away from the film it is kirkland you remember if it isn't obvious this film didn't sit well with me from the opening of the first act and deep within the second anna felt like a high school theater production the characters were non existent there was no enlightening pre story and there was no definition of time or place there was sally kirkland stubbornly saying that she is better than the other actresses vying for the same lifestyle that she wants randomly she encounters a friend a young girl that has also traveled a long distance to get to america for the glitz and glamour and two of them within the span of 20 minutes build a friendship that could break all walls it is emotionally boring and unbelievable again randomly we meet anna's boyfriend daniel played by the weak robert fields who brings nothing to the table in terms of definition or character Â only to boost the attention onto kirkland's anna through the course of nearly two hours we watch as more random acts coupled with unnamed characters intertwine together to feebly create a story that is held together by loose threads Â and sally kirkland arg it pains me to continue to say this but anna could have been a fantastic film had bogayevicz presented equal time between anna daniel and krystina but instead we are forced into a one sided game where emotional scenes speak louder than plot br br is this where charlize theron found inspiration for her beauty less role in monster or halle berry in monster's ball was sally kirkland one of the early actresses discover that by letting themselves go for a character oscar will shine in their direction throughout this film i was disgusted by kirkland's portrayal of anna and bogayevicz's lack of excitement for anything else fluent bogayevicz gives us an anna that doesn't work hard for her parts doesn't care for others and is generally mean spirited Â yet we are to feel sympathy for her near the beginning of the film she forces what she wants to do onto others and gets upset when she doesn't get her way sure aging actresses my have that appeal to them but kirkland creates a more childish character instead of a mature one that is where anna could have improved if this was a mature kirkland i would have gobbled it up but this stammering childish anna was impossible to believe while my favorite scene was near the end where anna goes to watch one of her older films playing included is absurd make out characters and the film burns this scene is also one of my least favorite anna has made a phenomenal life for herself creating films and building the dream yet when anyone else wants to enter that spotlight she gets jealous and outraged this didn't make for a character i wanted to stand behind nor win oscars coupled with the classic 80s background synthesizer the outrageous over the top wardrobe and the displaced ending where did that come from and what happened Â anna slipped far in the scope of amazing cinema it was a show piece an opportunity for an aging star to yell at the world one more time in this one it worked but i don't think i will be fooled again br br overall i cannot say that i was impressed with this film anna is not a film about an aging film star it is about sally kirkland and only sally kirkland bogayevicz tries to do more with the story but fails either because kirkland will not allow him or he just realizes that there isn't enough to support a full story there are one or two decent scenes in this film but nothing that promotes this film as innovative or influential bogayevicz did not create a character that audiences would believe tear up for or dedicate a sunday afternoon with Â he created an annoyance kirkland wasn't anna she was an actress playing her a bit overdone and crusty on the sides perhaps i missed the scope of this film but what makes films like this work is the cooperation of everyone involved that wasn't the case here in anna kirkland orders daniel to act like a dog apparently as a symbolic act and yet during the entire emotional scene i couldn't help but think that was what kirkland was like to those on the set she didn't make this into a film she transformed it into her own production and because of it anna failed i cannot suggest this to anyone Â from one czech to another Â skip it br br grade Â½ out of for that pesky theater scene that creeped me out
