<START> what can one say about a film that has one of the blackest most nihilistic and occasionally most weirdly i wont say 'sympathetic' i will say 'charismatic' villains in the history of the cinema and the best sword fight since flynn and fairbanks were in their heyday this is an epic about a stubborn sometimes foolish incredibly courageous and honest mans fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny i loved it john hurt and tim roth were great villains jessica lange was very moving tender and sensual
<START> absolutely the most boring movie i have ever spent my money on this was a wrong choice for all these great stars to waste their reputations on boring boring boring each character was portrayed in a less than inspirational way no acting talent shown just reading a part alec can play realistic characters normally gwynyth made herself look ugly for an unrewarding part annette needs advise on how to pick the movies she chooses to play in as do all these big stars who have left me disappointed at the way they have all allowed their talents to be smothered in a feature that leaves much to be desired in entertainment running with scissors leads the public to anticipate great acting in a film that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotion there was not one moment when the cast was able to portray any interpretation of this onto the screen maybe it was the director's fault whatever
<START> that 70s show is the best tv show ever period it's up there with the andy griffen show saturday night live and the simpsons in my book that 70s show continued on for 8 seasons all of which focus around a group of teenagers young adults dealing with relationships separating from their parents and their overall futures br br the two main characters eric and donna are two teenagers living next door to each other they have been living next door to each other for most of their lives and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season a large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working br br two other characters red and kitty are eric's parents red was in the service so he really pushes eric around kitty is just the opposite even though she drinks heavily she treats eric and his friends with a lot of care bob their neighbor is obviously donna's dad bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show's story bob also annoys red to his full extent br br the remaining character hyde kelso fez and jackie are eric's friends they also play a major role in the show's story br br well the first season is great this is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other the first season is original funny and enjoyable br br the second season is good although it isn't as good as the first it is a basic continuation of the first eric and donna are together and everything is working out great br br the third season is my favorite it went back and captured the first season feel and humor i also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch making the show all that more fun to watch br br the fourth season isn't near as good eric and donna arne't together in this one making the show slightly less pleasurable it is still funny although i didn't enjoy it as much as the previous seasons br br the fifth season is the last season i enjoyed all the way through it is the gang's senior year so that really helps with the story the fifth season also had the best ending out of all the seasons br br the sixth season is good for the most part it is extremely funny although it doesn't capture the feel that the other seasons did the gang is out of high school so i believe that it didn't hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did i also didn't like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to them br br the seventh season captures the same feel that the 5th season had in a way although it didn't do it all the way i enjoyed the seventh season as i did all the others and the ending is great br br the last season flat out sucked eric wasn't in it which ruined it kelso wasn't in it for the most part either which didn't help i hated the eighth season up until the last episode i thought that the last episode was really good and a fitting ending to the series br br so overall if you enjoy comedy give that 70s show a try they stopped making new episodes but it is still on tv a bunch i also recommend buying seasons 1 7 it is up to you if you want to buy season 8
<START> this is the first time i'm writing a comment on a movie on imdb but i had to write it for this one its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gonna be bad the acting is pathetic i'm a big fan of ajay devgan loved him in bhagat singh but he is at his worst in this movie amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one but somehow the fear is missing prashant raj is a non actor and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari i have no clue why the director took her in this movie the background score is repetitive somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar the color theme the background score the camera angles but it didn't work please don't watch it
<START> initially i would have thought that secret sunshine had something critical to say of religion and here being christianity and wondered if it would be something of a rant against the ills of blind faith or the manipulative power of those who are supposedly holier than thou surprisingly it was none of the sort and was largely non judgemental putting in place events as a matter of fact and allowing the audience to draw their own judgement and conclusion br br and i can't help but to chuckle at the role of song kang ho a man who's taken a liking for widower shin ae jeong do yeon and starts going to church when she does the reasons for church going are many i suppose either to find inner peace to seek help being afraid of eternal damnation in the fires of hell to reaffirm faith or even things like wanting to get married in a church or to skirt chase i kid you not but to each his own reasons for turning up in church every sunday and participating in prayer groups for fellowship what is indeed dangerous is when the underlying ulterior motives do not get satisfied and that's when frustration sets in or when you discover how hypocritical man can be portraying one face inside the house of god and displaying yet another outside br br shin ae and her son jun moves to the town of miryang which is the birthplace of her deceased husband wanting to start life anew she opens up a piano shop to give lessons though in discovering her new found freedom and in a moment's lack of good judgement has another tragedy befall her and that takes one hour to get to secret sunshine really took its time to get to this point where things then begin to get slightly more interesting with shin ae now taking to embracing religion to deal with and accept her current state reveling in the comfort that religion and fellow believers can offer br br what began as crying out for sympathy turns into acceptance and belief that religion offers that silver bullet to solve the ills of all mankind and sometimes you wonder if it's because of your personal myopic view of what the almighty is doing for you that you begin to adopt a somewhat selfish opinion that everything's good going your way and in shin ae's case her magnanimous attitude in wanting to forgive others who had trespassed against her forgetting something very fundamental that it the feeling can cut both ways too br br the last act is probably the most fun of the lot as it says plenty where most of us can identify with why me and why not someone else as we rage against our faith and start questioning unfortunately with no hard and fast answers available it is then either we fall by the wayside or continue with destructive deeds so rebelliously but somehow the plug gets carefully pulled in secret sunshine so as not to offend and what could have been an ugly character mouthpiece got muted br br if you bite into the hype this movie is generating then perhaps you'll realize only jeong do yeon's excellent portrayal is worth mentioning as she totally owns her role as the widow shin ae who is probably the most unluckiest person on earth in having to deal with that many tragedies over a short period of time and if you look at it carefully most of which are of her own doing watching her transformation is worth the ticket price and despite having my personal favourite korean actor song kang ho in the movie this is something he just breezed right through
<START> darius goes west is a film depicting american belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough this wonderful fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking film shows a young man who never expected but longed to see what was outside the confines of his lovely city of athens ga darius wished to see the ocean his longtime friends logan ben and several other good friends decided to make darius' wish come true they started small ben logan's mom started an email campaign to bring awareness to darius' condition duchenne muscular dystrophy and to raise funds for the fellas to take darius to not only see the ocean but to see these great united states to say the young college buddies succeeded in bringing hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement they realized darius' dream and then some they put their lives on hold while showing love care and tons of fun to darius while helping darius see how he can in turn show those same traits to others suffering from dmd darius went on to volunteer for the red cross sitting in his chair collecting money along with his buddies outside a local grocery store his wonderful smile tells the world that dreams do come true all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you give darius and all the guys an oscar no one else deserves it more martha sweeney
<START> oh what a condescending movie set in los angeles the center of the universe from the pov of hollywood filmmakers this movie tries to be a deep social commentary on contemporary american angst br br stereotyped smarmy characters of widely varying socio economic backgrounds cross paths in their everyday humdrum lives the plot is disjointed and desultory numerous unimaginative plot contrivances keep the film going like a drive by shooting an abandoned baby left in the weeds a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer a guy flying through the night sky over the city a kid at summer camp br br and through all these events the one constant is the generous helping of sociological insights imparted through the dialogue as characters compare notes on their life experiences one character tells another when you sit on the edge of that thing the grand canyon you realize what a joke we people are those rocks are laughing at me i could tell me and my worries it's real humorous to that grand canyon br br and another character pontificates about the meaning of it all there's a gulf in this country an ever widening abyss between the people who have stuff and the people who don't have it's like this big hole has opened up in the ground as big as the grand canyon and what's come pouring out is an eruption of rage and the rage creates violence br br aside from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue aside from the shallow smarmy characters aside from the dumb plot the story's pace is agonizingly slow acting is uninspired and perfunctory the film's tone is smug and self satisfied in the script's contempt for viewers br br this was a film project approved by hollywood suits who fancy themselves as omnipotent gurus looking down from on high they think their film will be a startling revelation to us lowly unknowing movie goers eager to learn about the real meaning of american social change
<START> the sunshine boys is a terrific comedy about two ex vaudevillians who reluctantly reunite for a tv special despite the fact that they despise each other br br the comic genius of two masters at work george burns and walter matthau are stellar some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting over the silliest little trivial things the material is fast paced and witty appealing to all ages br br mild spoiler alert there are some mildly sad moments toward the end of the movie that deal indirectly with the affects of aging that gives the film a soft sincere tenderness that shows to this reviewer that what the pair really need the most for success are each other br br if anyone loves the odd couple you'll adore this movie an excellent film
<START> this movie was horrible i swear they didn't even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie ice t was annoying as hell spoilers phht more like reasons not to watch it they sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes he coulda been long gone the ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs and when ice t is on that hill and uses that spaz 15 assault shotgun like its a sniper rifle and then cuts down a tree with eight shells it would take 1000's of shells to cut down a tree that size shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at 100yards and they even saw the reflection what reflected the light i didn't see a scope on that thing also when he got shot in the gut and kept going that was retarded he would of bled to death right there plusthe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel it wouldn't blow up and kill him the bullet would still fire kill ice t but mess up the barrel
<START> saw this on tv i'm glad i didn't go to the cinema to see this or spend the money on rental the movie is totally predictable from the corrupt owner and planner to the snaking electric cables the plot is really weak and unbelievable the avalanche expert guy gets hit by a 20 foot wave of bone breaking avalanche using actual footage and all he has to do is get up and shake himself down the avalanche thunders down at a million miles an hour and stops dead at the side of the road br br some of the actual avalanche material is impressive and shows its devastating power but the contract between the real avalanche and the staged stuff makes this film look even flimsier br br do yourself a favour don't bother with this one not even on t v
<START> a fondly remembered melodrama Â thanks chiefly to ronald colman's fine oscar winning central performance Â about an oft treated theme the nature of acting and how it can overtake one's perception of reality in this case we have a well known thespian tackling shakespeare's othello so that the film's last third delves effectively into the thriller genre Â with press agent edmond o'brien who happens to really be besotted with colman's co star and ex wife signe hasso 'investigating' the actor's possible involvement in the desdemona like strangling of a celebrity seeking waitress a very slim shelley winters the theatrical new york atmosphere of the immediate post war era is vividly captured by the husband and wife screen writing team of garson kanin and ruth gordon and legendary actor's director george cukor all of whom were recognized by the academy with nominations incidentally the film nabbed a second oscar for miklos rozsa's eclectic score colman forever the suave leading man blessed besides with a velvety voice does well enough by shakespeare Â gaining conviction the farther his character slips into obsessive jealousy a murderous rage and eventually paranoia however he is not let down by a supporting cast which also includes director ray collins reporter millard mitchell detective joe sawyer and coroner whit bissell though the mid section is a bit strained the film makes up for any deficiencies with a remarkably handled expressionist denouement
<START> i watched this movie purely for the setting it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of the plot was predictable the acting was mediorcre at best the scares were all gross outs not true scares br br i don't remember much of the plot and i think that's because there wasn't much of one to remember they didn't even use the hotel to it's fullest potential the beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula at low tide you can walk almost 1 4 mile into the bay which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks br br the best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action and i'm using that term loosly scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings
<START> the beaver trilogy is without a doubt one of the most brilliant films ever made i was lucky enough to catch it along with a q a session with director trent harris at the ny video festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of trent's website this movie has to be seen to be believed i sincerely recommend searching for trent's name on the web and then buying the film from his site he's an incredibly nice guy to boot don't get confused the cameraman in the fictional sections of the beaver trilogy is not trent br br after having seen the trilogy a few times i do have to admit that i could probably do without the sean penn version it's like a try out version for the crispin glover orkly kid section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if you're a penn fan than it being a good video penn is pretty funny though and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty b w video br br this is probably also one of crispin glover's best roles and i would just love to see an updated documentary about the original groovin' gary once you see this film you'll never get gary's nervous laughter out of your head ever again
<START> i love kristen dunst especially in elizabethtown i guess she's the kind of actress who had better not act before camera but just be herself she did that and she looked so natural in elizabethtown in this movie however she did try to add in more artificial performance especially in the first half of the film so that she looked more like a sober editor while in the other half she totally set herself back in her daily track and i just couldn't tell her to be an editor any way therefore her performance is not enduring in this film br br the film on the whole is attracting and inspiring the character of young is full and reasonable anyway the film tells a big and sophisticated story br br the only big defect is that it didn't show a turning point of the hero and heroine's love story i am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story because that is rather unclear for the two persons
<START> in this sequel to the 1989 action comedy classic k 9 detective dooley james belushi and his dog jerry lee return to fight crime but this time they are teamed up with another detective christine tucci and her partner a mean doberman named zues who does not get along with jerry lee very well dooley does not get along with his new partner much either that all changes as the movie goes along the movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill dooley for the way he treated him in the past there is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of dooley's wife that don't really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences dog poop jokes fart jokes and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area i know that that seems like very low humor but some of it is actually very funny i didn't see this movie for the jokes i saw it for two reasons the first reason is because i am a big james belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences james belushi is funnier than he was in k 9 and the action sequences at are better too it would have been nice to see more characters from k 9 to return but it's still a fun movie if you are a james belushi fan you'll love this movie
<START> this review is based on the dubbed shock o rama video released on an undeserving world in 2002 how bad is it it's awful which is what a '1' represents on the imdb scale but it's much worse than that it's nice to imagine that an original german language print might improve matters the comedic english language dubbing isn't funny at all but truthfully this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre you're likely to see the zombies in the film are as slow and clumsy as ever and they don't seem to have the ability to speak or think about anything beyond their next meal however they're also intelligent enough to operate chainsaws and malicious enough to know that western taboos about genitalia will no doubt enliven their dinner table conversation george romero's land of the dead posited a zombie nation that retained a shred of social coherence here zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imaginings of director andreas schnaas utterly without redeeming social value and even worse entirely lacking as entertainment zombie '90 is a bad joke on anyone who wastes money on it
<START> this movie was a confusing piece of garbage you never knew what was going on the characters were poorly written and for the most part they were totally unsympathetic except for gus played masterfully by george eads i hate this movie but compared to others dark harvest dracula's curse it should have won an academy award it was particularly sad to see a talented actor like george eads in such a disgraceful and tacky film lifetime you have sunken to whole new low someone needs to make sure that this director never works in movies again also was this supposed to be a horror film because it was a lot more funny than scary for shame lifetime for shame
<START> spoiler alert in this generic and forgettable action movie lorenzo lamas does his usual tough guy pretty boy act and his future real life ex kathleen kinmont is ass kicking hot chick alexa oj simpson is a detective coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona translation cable tv filler there isn't enough skin to qualify this as a guilty pleasure br br the script has some gaping holes best worst moment in one jarring scene oj's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue oj responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot or words to that effect this vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released it is truly appalling and therefore entertaining in an unintentional horrible way i was so startled that i laughed until champagne came out of my nose now that's a guilty pleasure bc
<START> this is indeed quite the strange movie first we have an ex u s gymnast trying to turn actor or something and this seems to be the only role he ever got that i know of anyway and for good reason while he does pull off the role well enough to keep some interest it is a rather bland and flat performance second we have the worst ever sound effects ever used in a movie i'm not kidding this alone makes the movie extremely comical but in that annoying way hehe and third while we have a generally decent acting supporting cast including the required hot chick an actually not so bad story and some cool visuals the dialogue fight scenes involving gymnastics hilarious and overall execution of the plot are weak this movie would have been barely better as a network tv movie too bad fox wasn't around in 1985 it's one of those movies that's simply bad yet you can't resist watching and even enjoying it once you get used to it especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night tv and cable
<START> in the lost son a private eye searching for a missing man stumbles upon a child prostitution ring this film incorporates all of the worst stereotypes you could imagine in a worst case scenario that exists only in the minds of hollywood the press and ag john asscrap if you get a chance to see this you'd be better off getting lost yourself
