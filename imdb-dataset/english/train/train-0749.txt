<START> i saw this movie on mystery science theater when it was called it lives by night that title is much less misleading than batpeople in fact it would more accurately be called batperson this movie is about a doctor who studies bats i am thinking because he wants to make a better cure for rabies this is not really clear what is clear is that he and his wife take a tour of a cave and he gets bitten by a bat why a scientist needs to take a tour to study bats is beyond me shouldn't he be able to go in by himself well after being bitten he and his wife go on their honeymoon where he starts having fits they go to the worst doctor ever the guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse in the end the guy kills 3 4 people and his wife stands by him and you are supposed to be rooting for him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders
<START> i actually retired from asian horror films some time ago after becoming completely sick of seeing samey ghost story rubbish however i've been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently and so decided to give them another chance my first port of call was highly rated director takashi miike's highly rated 'visitor q' i'd already seen audition and while i didn't like it much i do rate it as one of the better modern asian horror films so i went into this with sensible expectations and unfortunately found only boredom i suppose this movie is actually really clever and it just went over my head but what it seemed like to me was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherency between them any comparisons to the work of luis bunuel and david lynch is blasphemous as far as i'm concerned all miike has done here is make a film any intelligence surrounding it has been implemented by pretentious fans desperate to find some kind of meaning my headache set in about 10 minutes in after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason and it didn't subside until the movie finally ended at least twenty four hours later or so it would seem don't get me wrong i'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around but while this may be violent it's also pointless and boring and i didn't get one ounce of enjoyment out of it takashi miike may have a lot of fans but i'm certainly not one of them and i certainly hope this is the last time i'll come into contact with one of his films
<START> huge ramones fan i do like the ramones and i suppose if you hate them then besides being a avid bush supporter you might not like this classic br br it's immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80's infinitely better than the american pie's that plague us now br br there are some other great high school films switchblade sisters fast times class of '84 three o'clock high and the cheesy yet gripping doesn't seem possible river's edge but rnrhs will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and most fun plus you can get up and dance with it br br i love you riff randell br br 10 10
<START> cinderella is one of disney's greatest films one of those films i think you appreciate more the older you get disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairytale i consider the film to have been the greatest of his films at the time of its release the characters became more dimensional than earlier films creating more depth to appreciate the characters more cinderella herself is in my opinion one of the greatest characters disney ever created with her kindness and dash of dry humor she is extremely likeable however it is the inspiration she provides which makes her memorable like many people she is an endless dreamer and she holds onto her dreams never giving up even in the most adverse of situations her dreams endure and she won't let anyone take that away from her her example should serve as inspiration to everyone and encouragement to never let go of your dreams
<START> in my eyes this is almost the perfect example of hollywood ego only beaten by the new king kong movie superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears tights brandon routh was the worst superman i've ever seen from the start of the movie u just wanna shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat he looks just silly wearing the costume but enough about him kate bosworth was a bad choise for lois lane she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl the plot was weak and predictable wow he is actually supermans son who would have ever thought and the acting was horrible this movie has one good thing going for it and it's name is kevin spacey his portrayal of lex luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie what this movie needed was the cast of lois and clark except kevin spacey of course and a different story i watched this movie after watching the hills have eyes and i was chocked to learn that there existed worse movies then that
<START> i remember going to see the movie in the summer of '78 with my parents and being pretty into it at the time of course i was seven at the time br br right before the jackson movies came out my wife and i rented this movie since she had never seen it and i was feeling nostalgic br br ralph bakshi ran out of money about mid way through the animation process for this movie and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping the animation technique for people on a budget this is saying something much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them br br because of budget constraints the movie already a compression of the fellowship of the rings and part of the two towers was pared down even more what you get is sort of like a film strip version of the cliff notes of the books br br its not all bad though the animation brings a warmth to it that i found lacking in the jackson movies its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding br br this movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came several years later a half hearted half hour long tv special was aired which was meant to wrap things up all i will say about that is that it was a musical
<START> this movie was o k but it could have been much better there are some spooky moments but there aren't enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again there are some scenes you could fast forward through not miss anything the biggest flaw is that it is so predictable that is the reason why i rated it so low it's watchable but don't expect anything great
<START> this film was probably inspired by godard's masculin fÃ©minin and i urge you to see that film instead br br the film has two strong elements and those are 1 the realistic acting 2 the impressive undeservedly good photo apart from that what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness lena nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world she acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film it's unattractive comparing to godard's film intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity without going too far on this subject i would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the french and the swedish society br br a movie of its time and place 2 10
<START> i am obsessed the story is amazing and the show is highly addictive but i love it i am on season 2 disc 5 and i tell you that i am too attached to the characters now for anything bad to happen to them would seriously affect my vote for the show and michael is on my list now kidding i am so happy to see there is a season 3 because i was too afraid to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be ending i can't wait to see the rest now thanks to the directors producers and actors of lost i enjoy watching tv again before lost i surfed through every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment in television but i have to say that lost is my kind of entertainment

<START> for those fans of laurel and hardy the 1940s and beyond were a very sad time for the team their contracts with hal roach studios had expired and now they were free agents able to work for any studio who offered them a job unfortunately fox rko mgm without roach and even a french film company who hired the boys had absolutely no touch for their comedic talents plus stan and ollie were a lot older and seeing these geriatric men taking pratfalls seemed sad not particularly funny stan looked very ragged and ollie's weight had ballooned up to the point where he could barely walk and so it made me feel uncomfortable laughing at their very very sedate antics br br in addition to their age this particular film suffers because fox studios oddly cast them in a supporting role and created a parallel plot involving a young couple something that reduced their time on screen and turned them into insipid hangers on instead of just being themselves a cute and cuddly stan and ollie is very foreign to the old laurel and hardy of the 20s and 30s and just seemed awfully strange and suited them poorly br br now even with their age this could have been a decent movie if it had been given decent writing and if it appeared the studio cared and it's quite obvious they were using the b unit here with at best second class support in particular there are very few laughs and the last 10 minutes of the film is simply dreadful relying exclusively on a sloppy rear projected screen for the stupid chase scene which might just rank as one of the worst of its kind in film history br br for mind numbed zombie lovers of laurel and hardy it's probably a film they will love but for lovers of the team who are willing to honestly evaluate this film relative to their amazing earlier films it simply comes up wanting indeed in fact of all their full length films pre 1940 i can't think of one i liked less than dancing masters unfortunately of the post 1940 films this might just be one of their better ones sadly it got a lot worse with wretched films like the big noise and nothing but trouble i just wish the boys had just retired after saps at sea br br finally i wonder if all the generally positive reviews for this film on imdb might reflect the reviewers' love of the team more than it's an indication that this is a good film for an audience who are not already in love with the team i don't know how this film will do anything but bore the audience it certainly won't convince anyone that laurel and hardy were comedic geniuses but even comedic geniuses need material worthy of their talents
<START> i saw this movie on tv late one night years ago but it was a disturbing experience that has stayed with me to this day br br the premise may seem a bit unoriginal due to an earthquake a hidden underground store of a toxic nerve agent in the hills above a small town is breached and a microscopic amount of the substance finds its way into their food supply the inhabitants of the town begin to lose their ability to exercise restraint over every whim and base desire that floats through all of our minds from time to time and that normally we know we simply must not act upon br br the pace of the movie is slow but for me that only added to the creeping unease as the townspeople's behaviour slowly starts to unravel there are several surreal and very unsettling scenes that have remained etched in my memory all this time br br it raises interesting questions about what we could all be capable of if we gave in to our most feral instincts did i enjoy it i'm not sure 'enjoy' is the right word did it make me think definitely i'm still thinking about it scary stuff
<START> most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm not so this gloriously bent batty and berserk over the top italian made shot in canada kitsch gut buster it's a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously over baked what the hell's going on crackpot excess and inanity br br a freighter ship crew discovers the body of a 30 foot yeti that resembles a hirsute 70's disco stud complete with jumbo wavy afro perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice they dethaw the beast jolt him back to life with electric charges grossly mistreat him and keep the poor hairy goliath in an enormous glass booth before you can say hey the filmmakers are obviously ripping off 'king kong' our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage grabs the first luscious nubile blonde euro vixen the gorgeous pheonix grant he lays lustful eyes on and storms away with his new lady love the yeti gets recaptured and flown to toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience of course he breaks free again nabs the vixen and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampage br br the sublimely stupid dialogue sample line philosophy has no place in science professor cheesy far from special effects the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jaw dropping awfulness clunky mis direction and a heavy handed script that even attempts a clumsily sincere is the yeti a man or a beast ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen better still we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yeti's nipples which causes it to harden and elicits a big leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth the vixen nurses the yeti's wounded hand while he makes goo goo eyes at her the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building and the furry fellow even breaks a man's neck with his toes overall this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded should be camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy that's eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following
<START> these slasher pics are past their sell by date but this one is good fun br br the valentine cards themselves are witty and well thought out br br the film has one peach of a line he's no angel when he in fact is angel watching buffy reruns will never be the same br br the cast is a sizzling display of young talent but the story does not give them enough real depth denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters sorry but no br br the direction is very good managing to show very little actual gore and relying on your imaginations implied threat much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes br br essentially the main directorial plus lies within the borrowing of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks psycho's shower scene is tributed along with halloween's masking br br murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know br br light viewing not very scary but a few good jump moments if it was a choice between the hole and this though choose the hole slasher movies have had their day and this is just another slasher a very good slasher but nothing groundbreaking
<START> just looking at the sets staging and editing it is easy to tell this project lacked a proper budget maybe bela lugosi is meant to take your mind off of things like that young brides drop dead at the altar after saying i do their corpses are stolen by a renowned horticulturist dr lorenz lugosi and a couple of his freakish minions as his aging wife elizabeth russell needs injections of the glandular fluids of the young virgins to remain forever young forever beautiful an eager local cub reporter luana walters realizes that each missing bride wore the same rare orchid to the altar an orchid in which dr lorenz would be most knowledgeable a typical horror movie storm brews making a visit to the lorenz estate a bit spooky especially with a dwarf and a slobbering hunchback on the premises other players angelo rossitto tristram coffin minerva urecal and frank moran
<START> i didn't expect much when i saw this at the palm springs film fest this weekend it was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out still i held out hope it sounded a bit much like bride and prejudice l a guy falls for an indian beauty parental conflict blah blah blah b p was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters br br my bollywood bride had none of that the acting seemed stilted and way to by the numbers characters were so clichÃ© the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student technically the sound really bothered me it seemed as if there was a lot of over dubbing of dialogue i mean a lot i know sometimes it's necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distracting br br two stars is being somewhat generous
<START> i went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned alice entertainment once i realized i would not be getting that i watched it for a pretty well made movie in terms of filming and yeah that was it but aside from it having a good film quality considering i had been watching grainy movies all day long there was nothing good about that movie br br he killed 42 why were tweedle dee and dum played by mudler and scully serisouly who can answer that for me who can answer anything awful about this movie for me br br i agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff that's all it seemed to be br br poor mr carroll i'm so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales
<START> the back cover of the dvd missed this one when it came out hails hitler the rise of evil as a triumph the new york post and mesmerizing newsweek br br well never mind the post but really who ever wrote that word in newsweek in the same context with this peace of ahem art should be sacked br br i don't no where to start with why try to paint the picture of hitler's evil with colors that did not exist he was evil alright but now his character is portrayed in way that is often historically inaccurate compared to his love of animals the gentle and subdued way he treated women and so on br br the actors are good so you must feel sorry for them as they are imprisoned inside their one dimensional characters some kind of curse here with peter o' toole this is the second time in his honorable career when he has ended up playing an old and failed leader in a failed movie or in this case tv production to be accurate the first one was of course the legendary galigula br br the list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill the 1000 words allowed by imdb so i think i'll leave it here br br this one is ok if it's on telly and you don't have anything else to do but believe me it's best left on the shelf in your local virgin store
<START> despite the gravity of the subject and probably the good intentions of the filmmakers to make a film addressing white supremacy the inconsistencies of its main character bronson green aspiring new york actor easily turned l a phony makes it hard to take the story seriously green who is constantly rejected by los angeles casting agents for being obsolete i e too new york when the 80s is looking for big blonde and dumb he finds success comes easily when he's willing to succumb to falsifying his image unfortunately the new hair dye and pacified surfer attitude lands him an acting opportunity with the jericho church which subscribes white supremacist teaching of the aryan nation green is willing to easily forget his past and particularly turning his back on his young black friend of ten years in order to be the church's new spokesman this makes no sense seeing as how principled our character initially is it is this sudden and loose change in character coupled with an abrupt reversion back to the hardened deniro obsessed as his taxi driver character form who is able to battle the villains a noble attempt on the filmmakers but one that ultimately reveals itself as anything but serious br br the other characters too are quite annoying and what we are forced to recognize in them comes too easily the psychotic paranoia of the church leader the self interested actress girlfriend the first girlfriend bronson has when he's in l a and the new blonde girlfriend who's character lacks so much development she is for the most part just a walking talking void we are just supposed to see them in fleeting moments in which something random forces us to draw assumptions about the characters but there is really little development of any of them br br the other problem with this film is the ungodly amount of time the characters are involved in very little important action much of the beginning concerns introducing the characters obviously and later we see bronson's difficulties with breaking into the l a acting scene and the frustrations which stem from constant rejection but after he does willingly change his looks and personality in order to become accepted there is at least a good twenty minutes to thirty minutes of wasted film in which very little of anything happens br br for films that seek to draw attention to the irrational fears behind racism this was not one done with enough credibility
<START> this movie is one of the worst comedy movies i have ever seen i hate these napoleon dynamite rip offs just face it people the dumb humor has been mastered already make something new for once all these new comedies are just horrible and coming out of snl andy samberg is not ready for a lead role yet i hope he can bounce back from this awful movie and will arnetts character is just plain bad hey will did you read the script the plot is truly the worst ever written now you tell me if this is weird this is the movie rod kimble's step dad frank is dying and the family needs 50 000 to pay for the heart surgery so rod is planning this huge jump to raise money for frank only so that rod can beat frank in a fight and prove his manliness yes thats the movie you tell me would u spend 7 00 to see that piece of crap br br 3 10 just horrible br br adam
