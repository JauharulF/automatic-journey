<START> if there was a 0 stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste the fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse the basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine but wheres the experiment all i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i don't know or want to know about the challenges are pathetic and silly the whole point of reality tv is to show reality if you set a 'challenge' don't make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in 'friday night games' make them do an actual challenge and as for 'earning' prize money thats fine if they actually earnt it these people are nuts if only they would make the show better the actual idea would be glorious but that ain't gonna happen
<START> since crouching tiger hidden dragon came along there's been a lot of talk about a revival of the hong kong movie industry don't believe it the people now making movies in hk give new meaning to the word crass running out of time 2 is a perfect example ekin cheng is the name draw here but he spends most of the film just grinning idiotically and flipping a coin he flips the coin over and over and again and again why who knows sean lau plays a cop who chases after the coin flipping pretty boy but once again who knows why there's a pretty actress in the female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but she mostly just looks like she would rather be at a spa or shopping centre than in front of a camera nothing makes any sense there is no action there is no sex there is no comedy all there is is a name ekin cheng and you know what who cares
<START> this is one of the most insipid lackluster unoriginal and pointless movies ever made it almost feels like everyone involved in this project didn't even try to make an appealing movie this is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of smokey and the bandit which i think is the best film of them all as for this waste of film stock burt reynolds sleepwalks his way through the entire movie jim nabors is wasted the other actors aren't given very much to do the car races are obviously stock footage the humor is uninspired and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours stroker ace is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it
<START> i saw this movie at the 18th haifa film festival and it is one of the best i've seen this year seeing it on a big screen and i mean big not one of those tv screens most cinemas have with an excellent sound system always enhance the cinematic experience as the movie takes over your eyes and ears and sucks you into the story into the picture br br the movie presents a set of characters which are loosely inter connected their stories cross at certain points and the multiplicity of story lines reminded me very much of the great robert altman and his exquisite films but the true hero of the movie is obviously the city of madrid which provides the backdrop for the entire movie it houses the characters contains the pavements and roads on which they walk and sets the background atmosphere for all the events all in beautifully filmed scenes br br the movie returns again and again to certain themes shoes for instance and in essence salazar makes his metaphores more and more understandable to the viewer as the movie progresses he combines the views of the city with the shots of the characters and elegantly matches the feeling of the scene to the background a set of talented actors helps him portrait a wide variety of characters one excellent example is the scene in which juaquin takes anita across the street for the first time it might not work on a small screen but it gave me goose bumps easily on a big screen br br the message of the movie is very positive and accordingly the movie is light and funny at times the music along the movie is usually pop with a few instrumental pieces i hope to put my hand on the soundtrack one day although i seriously doubt i will br br all together i came out of this movie with a sensational feeling and i'm not easily impressed you'll have to take my word for it for this and more i give this movie a solid 8 10
<START> ossessione is in very bad state but is now undergoing a full restoration at digital film lab in copenhagen the material used is a master positive 2nd generation originally from the print visconti managed to hide from the fascists it has been scanned on the spirit 4k as 2k rgb data then processed using davinci revival restoration software after this the rest is manual labor and we do not anticipate finishing before early spring sometime next year it should be available on dvd and hopefully also released on hd dvd this film is beautiful and we hope the restoration effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come
<START> that hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say it's funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally too only two of the sisters are really bad boy are they bad too one is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where e'er she goes the other is got up to look like marilyn monroe she has those sensual slightly parted lips and not to give anything away she is even more bad than the other br br all three sisters are played by starlets the man who stumbles into their lives is played by john bromfield he had something of a career br br this looks today like possibly the first mainstream soft core porn ever marketed well of course not the first but the raciest at that time br br the girls wear as little as possible and let's not forget about the female audience members bromfield is shown shaving with an electric razor whose fetish was this bare chested he also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit br br there's a real plot here too the girls' family see is cursed they are prone to suicide or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide br br the movie is not bad i truly don't know where it was shown maybe it was made for drive ins somehow and i could be wrong i felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here the women are scantily dressed they often resemble lurid covers of mags like police detective or jackets of dime novels br br but the guy seems to be the central focus not everyone in the movie likes him but all the girls love him and i think the audience is meant to also br br it's lots of fun and on its own terms too
<START> this movie is not your typical horror movie it has some campy humor and death scenes which can be sort of comical i personally liked the movie because of its off beat humor it's definetely not a super scary movie which is good if you don't want to be scared and paranoid afterwards i liked the performance of the hillbilly guy and of lester very believable i think i'm going to dye my hair red like that girl in scarecrow very cool anyway overall worth renting for the campy humor and non typical horror experience
<START> i gave this loooooooooooong film a 2 because of the attractive actors and semi sexy love scenes otherwise if you can't read like a speed reader you will never get through the subtitles that try to keep up with the spanish speed talking and what the hell is going on in the plot if you can't read the subtitles endless stares and goof eyes and constant rejection just boring after an hour or so some good cinematography but also some so dark you think your screen has burned out how this won anything i will never understand difficult to talk about acting since the lead actors seem to just stare and look lovingly at each other when they are not pushing each other away the character geraldo is so attractive that it is difficult to believe that anyone would push him away and what is with his mother i just plain didn't get it most of the time except that there were three guys that all seem to have had a history with each other but never figured out who was whose ex
<START> lordi was a major hype and revelation in 2007 because they won the eurovision song contest with a not so heavy metal song called hard rock hallelujah and appeared on stage dressed like hideous monsters but let's face it their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents the eurovision contest gradually turned into one big political circus over the years and lordi probably just won because their song finally brought a little change and Â even more importantly because their whole act sort of ingeniously spoofed the whole annual event the absolute last thing lordi's first and hopefully last horror film brings is change and ingenuity dark floors based on an idea of the lead singer and starring the rest of the band in supportive roles is a truly unimaginative and hopeless accumulation of clichÃ©s the immense budget dark floors supposedly is the most expensive finnish film ever definitely assures greatly macabre set pieces and impressive make up art but what's the point where there's no story that is worth telling the film takes is set in a busy hospital where a bunch of people among them a father and his young daughter with an unidentifiable illness become trapped in the elevator during a power breakdown when the doors open again the floors are empty and it looks as if the hospital lies abandoned since many years already trying to reach the exit the group stumbles upon several morbid and inexplicable obstacles like eyeless corpses screaming ghosts and heavy metal monsters emerging from the floors the only three points i'm handing out to dark floors are exclusively intended for the scenery and the adequate tension building during the first half of the film for as long as the sinister events don't require an explanation the atmosphere is quite creepy but as soon as you realize the explanation will a be very stupid or b never come the wholesome just collapses like an unstable house of cards lordi's costumes never really were scary to begin with except maybe to traditional eurovision fans and in combination with a story more reminiscent to asian ghost horror they just look downright pathetic and misfit with all the national myths and truly unique exterior filming locations i personally always presumed finland Â the land of a thousand lakes Â would be the ideal breeding ground for potentially horrific horror tales but i guess that's another disillusion on my account
<START> cypher is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in america in the not too distant future while thematically not complex this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty ruthlessness and corporate conspiracy to a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf br br the film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man morgan sullivan jeremy northam who applies to the digicorp group to work as an undercover operative after an initial briefing with digicorp's security chief sullivan is then given a new identity jack thursby and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies upon successfully completing his first assignment sullivan thursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered however on one of his business trips he inadvertently runs into a woman named rita foster liu whom he had met on his previous assignment and from there things go extremely topsy turvy the implications of a diabolical conspiracy involving digicorp's espionage program begin to emerge and sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of digicorp's main competitors thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companies br br spoilers end here br br what i liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic household settings while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and cover up i was also very impressed with jeremy northam not too often have i seen him in the lead role and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of wisconsin was brilliant personally i think he's one of the many under used actors in the industry who hasn't been given more challenging roles lucy liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak and dagger tone additionally the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job however my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated for example i would have loved to see what would have happened if jack thursby had developed a more intimate relationship with his second wife overall this is a cleverly developed cloak and dagger story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional loyalties and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted with a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future i'm surprised that i had never watched this hidden gem before this is a brilliant not too overly complicated spy thriller and therefore i'm giving it a 9 out of 10
<START> in the small american town of meadowvale dr anthony blake david gale the imdb listing for this character is wrong it's definitely dr blake not dr blakely is the director and founder of the famed 'psychological research institute' and also host's a local t v programme called 'independent thinkers' he uses this t v show to hypnotise the viewers and make them commit acts of violence dr blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses it's spinal cord as a tail thingy usually the brain is just sitting in a tank eats mice and the odd bad actor each time it eats someone it gets much bigger meanwhile at the local high school gifted but troublesome teenager jim majelewski tom bresnahan has been caught putting sodium down the toilets jim is sent to dr blake at the pri for help with his attitude and behavioural problems while there dr blake hooks jim up to well something i'm not actually sure what this whatever it is is attached to the brain at first jim is able to resist the brain's mind control the brain feels that jim is a threat to itself and it's plans once out of the pri jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend janet cynthia preston as cyndy preston but is handed back to dr blake's assistant verna george buza soon after by officer marks harry booker the brain wants to kill jim because he is the only one capable of withstanding it's mind control techniques and with 'independent thinkers' going national the brain doesn't want anything or anyone to stop it's evil plan for world domination jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain before it takes over the world br br directed by ed hunt who calls himself edward hunt here the brain wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be don't get me wrong as it certainly isn't great either the script by barry pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by t v storyline it moves along at a fair pace and isn't too boring no explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all it's just there and that's it we have to accept it the story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element there's the t v mind control the brain itself jim being hunted by the police his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding dr blake that isn't explained at all production wise this film looks cheap and probably was cheap the acting isn't great but i've seen worse and what is david gale doing in this in fact this role is similar to gale's role in re animator 1985 even down to his character's deaths in both films the brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big each stage is just made of rubber it doesn't look particularly good and isn't scary or creepy just cheap there's no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and you'll miss it decapitation the nudity is provided by dr blake's assistant vivian christine kossak as christine kossack before she gets eaten the brain had a certain entertainment value for me but i would think most people would dislike it maybe worth a watch if you can see it on t v for free
<START> my roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her she's from china and only heard so much about 9 11 and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary i felt awful watching this documentary it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes br br but i'm extremely grateful that i watched this documentary because on the day of september 11th i'm sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard all of us could only think certain questions why how what's going on oh my god almost all the americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others but i don't think we thought about what they were really going though this wasn't actually supposed to be a documentary about 9 11 the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the world trade centers and got everything outside and in on tape br br on sep 11th i thought to myself it's ok the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived to be honest i thought it was an accident i was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class someone came into the locker room shouting some building just got bombed in new york we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on tv not only 15 seconds later live on tv does the second plane crash into the other world trade center and we knew this was no accident a few minutes later we heard about the pentagon and that there was a plane headed for chicago but was shot down so many thoughts ran through our heads and i kept on thinking what are the firemen and policemen going to do but it's procedure to them i thought they'll know what to do br br the first tower collapsed we knew it so many lives are now gone the second tower crashed things would never be the same those firemen in this documentary showed courage confusion and strength the real raw human emotions they didn't know what to do they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers they heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows and here i was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on tv i was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to new york and tell them how grateful all the americans were for their help i know they feel like they were just doing their job but they did more they were hero's every day after sep 11th for 3 weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors but they kept on hoping and praying may god bless their kind and brave hearts br br as for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks she got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day she asked why i didn't know what to say it breaks my heart that people can be that evil it sounds clique' but it was a normal day for everyone one of the firemen said in the documentary no one expected this to happen not like that those people in the world trade centers or the pentagon or the planes that were hijacked they were just doing their job happen to be there or even just was there for a second passing by they were not just murdered they were slaughtered and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating why do people do this they celebrated death and the lose of mothers fathers sisters brothers friends grandparents aunts uncles cousins etc why br br so thanks to those people for making this documentary you truly think about the firemen policemen and the troops in iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world thank you to all those people you are our heroes br br 10 10
<START> this is one of those movies you think that the makers would refuse to release it because it is so terrible obviously they were thinking that children are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless ads and would think they are entertainment because it is slapstick funny what is it with the talking car with buttons that say wendy's mcdonalds m m's and skittles there was no talking car in the cartoon dr claw is supposed to be evil not handsome and charming why is rupert everet 'claw' anyway were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes it looks like they were badly lampooning robo cop with the turning a man into a crime fighting android thing i tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if i watch more than 30 minutes of a movie you don't get a refund i'm sorry i watched more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap after i was told the no refund policy i decided to watch the rest of the hideous garbage called inspector gadget
<START> in the ten years since wildside aired nothing has really come close to its quality in local production this includes the two series of the enjoyable but overrated underbelly which have brought to life events in the recent criminal history of both sydney and melbourne the miniseries blue murder which also starred tony martin but as someone on the other side of the law may be the exception br br wildside is currently being repeated late at night on the abc having not watched the show in quite a while i'm still impressed by its uncompromising story lines and very human characters the cast is excellent tony martin as a detective haunted by the disappearance of his son rachael blake who later hooked up with martin in real life as a community worker struggling with alcoholism and alex dimitriades as a young cop whose vice is gambling equally good support roles are provided by aaron pederson jessica napier mary coustas yes effie herself and a young abbie cornish br br the abc inexplicably released only the first three episodes on dvd a couple of years ago the logic of this sort of marketing is beyond me but i'm guessing it may have something to do with licensing disagreements with the original producers br br a great series which has aged remarkably well here's hoping the abc's dvd department gets its act together br br according to a moderator on an abc message board some sort of further dvd release is due in december 2009
<START> in a recent biography of alec guinness i couldn't find too much about to paris with love i'm sure guinness did the film to get a free trip to paris out of it the film has no other reason for existence br br paris of course is nicely photographed with that wonderful opening of guinness and his son driving down the champs elysee with the arc de triomphe in the background unfortunately it goes downhill from there br br there is just no chemistry at all between guinness and the young girl who he has a brief fling with in paris according to the recent biography of guinness by piers paul read guinness positively disliked the girl found her conduct unprofessional as to what odile vernois thought of her co star no record is available they have as much chemistry as two neutered cats br br guinness does have a good moment in the film which was straight from one of his ealing comedies as he climbs a tree trying to retrieve a badminton shuttlecock but i wouldn't wait through the film for it br br at least alec got a trip to paris out of the deal
<START> after too many years of waiting anne rivers siddons' noted 1979 book the house next door has finally been filmed the result veers a bit from the novel which especially in the first story of the trilogy is understandable if unsatisfying as it's a tv film the whole of which is absorbing and actually very good just not as great as the book one of stephen king's favorites and one of mine as well br br with more running time and fewer constraints as a theatrical release all the richness inherent in the original three part story of the ominous ultramodern house could have been explored and nurtured especially the climactic revelation near the very end br br still the whole cast does well in this thoughtful tale of mindless malevolence there are a few unnecessary cheap shocks but the growing atmosphere of dread is well developed actually one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by its next door amateur artist neighbor who is trying to visualize its corruption on canvas br br be sure to read the great novel
<START> a group of forest rangers and scientists go into the woods to find fossils they stumble on a bigfoot burial ground eventually the didn't notice it in the dark the scenes of the cgi bigfoot are horrid but better than the endless scenes of talking that they rarely punctuate i used to think that there just might be a good bigfoot movie to be made but now after so many sad sad movies about the legend i'm having serious doubts to pour salt in the wound of watching this film the one good looking girl just doesn't get naked once and while this one may be better than boggy creek 2 no mean feat there it's still sad that the best non documentary film on bigfoot remains harry and the henriksons br br my grade d
<START> most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog the tim burton batmans had it as did in an even more grotesque manner sin city with dick tracy producer director star warren beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework like a boisterous homage to 1930s gangster pictures only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker bonnie and clyde dick tracy is filled joyfully with archetypes and bright primary colors where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities villains like the stooge shoulders lips the brow mumbles the blank pruneface spud chester gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass the film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously br br if at the time movies like batman and underrated teenage mutant ninja turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comic book outline dick tracy is more 'old school' it's a story of cops and crooks or rather a cop detective tracy as he tries to bust big boy al pacino in what is arguably his biggest performance to date and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style but with no such luck there's also a little kid called simply the kid charlie korsmo who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than would've been imagined and tracy's love interest in tess and then there's the nightclub 'dame' madonna who probably doesn't give any kind of great acting performance but maybe that suits the role fine and she sings excellently when called upon who wont testify unless tracy admits feelings he doesn't have for her then there's convoluted dealings with taking tracy down and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voice br br meantime as if doing an impersonation of a howard hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions dick tracy adds on the wink and nod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes it's a wonder to look at this world which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers i e sin city which can be justifiably compared to beatty's film we're driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line or whatever there is of it in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old i'm almost reminded of the cotton club during these sequences as story music detail and a few big punches and gun shots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said which actually isn't more than it needs to and there's a heap load of catchy dialog from the script one of my favorites the enemy of my enemy is my enemy plus any of pacino's references to other figures in quotes br br revisiting this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater and only remembering little bits dick tracy is a hard boiled fantasy to the finest degree it's filled with good cheer for the kids and with some pretty good action squared away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comic book movies i e pg 13 fare and for the adults its throw back central done with panache and a solid feeling for the unsubtle even dustin hoffman hams it up and he barely says an audible word
<START> but the actress playing the daughter just doesn't come across as credible br br it doesn't work for me when i see an actress of about 25 years playing the role of a 12 year old other commentators have suggested that this is one of the messages of this film that children may sometimes seem more adult like than adults but with the casting as it is in this film it just doesn't work for me br br you might want to check other comments to find out what this film is actually about because i couldn't bear watching it to the end br br i agree that the premise for this film is beautiful though i wish another director would try to pick up this story again
<START> a battleship is sinking its survivors hanging onto a nearby liferaft sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks br br even though noel coward's name is the only one that you notice during the credits everything that's cinematic in it is because of lean and on technical terms its very good david lean just knew films from the get go there are many moments where coward's studied dialogue takes a second seat and lean's visual sense takes centre stage try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end and that whole scene the tracking shot towards the hymn singing the scene where we're inside a house that gets bombed br br noel coward is one of the worst actors i've ever seen he's totally wooden not displaying emotion character or humanity you can see it in his eyes that he's not really listening to what the other performer is saying he's just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own line br br 7 10 br br its episodic a bit repetitive and the flashbacks overwhelm the story there's no central story that they advance just give general insights into the characters still its an interesting film worth a watch and a good debut for lean its not a very deep or penetrating film and its definitely a propaganda film but its also a showcase for lean's editing skills its all about how the pieces are put together
