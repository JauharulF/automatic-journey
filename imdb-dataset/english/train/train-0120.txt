<START> i saw this movie recently 2 hours later my head still hurt from laughing the plot was soo awful the jokes were soo bad but what i didn't count on were br br 1 the 2 scenes before and after the movie that had pat and jay posing that caused more than enough laughter br br 2 the kick through the windshield that decapitated the evil doer br br this movie is about 20 times better than the rush hour series and my copy even came with a disclamer saying if you didn't like the movie send certificate to hbo while i considered it the date you had to send it in was january 1991 which also caused wackiness to ensue
<START> this movie is more deceiving than ever using a suspenseful looking actor like walken to play in this piece of junk made it look like he had nothing better to do than play a boring role like this one and the fact that the movie was supposed to be about some witch and you really don't see that until almost the end of the movie but meanwhile you have to sit and watch this boring film while it gets or tries to get to the meaning of the point and you have to go through this whole trail of boring actors and actresses thinking the whole time of how you passed off another movie and decided on this one and how you have just waisted your money just makes the whole point of time useless sitting there i'd rather watch cartoons for goodness sakes leave this one alone please
<START> a very pretty red headed woman waiting for her plane meets a charming young man that she connects with as the two get on their flight and sit next to each other the young man jack becomes deadly as he threatens lisa to either change the room that a politician and his wife will be staying in or else have her father die see now that's what you happens when you fly coach stuff like that never happens in first class br br other than having a conflict that takes place on a flight the other thing that this movie shares with flightplan is the sheer unbelievability if that's a word of the story the point of the whole is to get the main character to change a politician's room so he can be assassinated which is a pretty plausible plan but won't it have being easier for jack to just find someone that was computer savvy and have them hack into the hotel's system teenagers today can damn near do anything with computers so i'm pretty sure it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change it using a computer instead of going through the trouble of spying on lisa and getting her into the predicament that she lands on in the movie br br plus one thing that struck me as odd was how no one on the plan heard a single thing they were talking about this is a very small plane were talking about here and since their voices were raised occasionally it seems to me like the other passengers should have heard something but i'm 100 sure that i'm reading way too much into it the movie is meant to be as realistic as an episode of 24 so one can't be perplexed by such complexities for all my complaints though this is still a very fun movie that gets the job done it's not exactly the type that requires to shut of your brain but at the same time it doesn't require great intelligence to fully enjoy br br i'd love to sit here in my comfy chair and rave about the brilliant acting in the movie but really i can't i love rachel mcadams i love cillian murphy and i like brian cox but they don't really stretch their acting muscles here it's not really much of a problem since this isn't the movie that studios hope to win multiple awards and the acting isn't the least bit horrible just not great wes craven isn't exactly the first that comes to mind when you think of a movie like this but he does a very nice job considering the time they had to film the movie and the lack of depth to the script it was definitely a huge improvement over the disappointing cursed and as much as i liked him doing something different with this movie i still would love for him to go back to doing what he did in the past which is great horror movies that is talked about decades after it's release br br one nice thing about the movie which i really appreciated was just how short the movie was it is great to sit and watch a nice three hour or so movie once in a while but nowadays it's like every movie that comes out feels too long where as this movie just felt like the right length not too long and too short they don't waste time by trying to develop the characters too much because they know this isn't the movie for that and by doing so they made a very nice short movie being a huge film music geek i have to say that the best part of the movie is the ultra cool score by marco beltrami it's really nice to see beltrami go from writing the predictable stuff to the great music he's doing now i really the cool techno orchestral stuff he does for the main titles too bad that i can't find the soundtrack anywhere would have really loved to listen to the titles anytime i wanted instead of having to pop in the dvd when i want to hear it br br overall it's nice for what it is and whiles it's far from great cinema should still provide for some small entertaining hour and a half
<START> somewhere in his non fiction book danse macabre stephen king suggests that one secret of writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers exactly what horrible thing is waiting behind the door to get them if at last the door bursts open and a bug ten feet tall lurches through the reader may be a little scared but he'll also think well i can deal with that at least it wasn't a hundred feet tall there's nothing more frightening than what lurks unseen and unknown just on the other side of that tightly closed door waiting to get you br br the haunting is so completely misconceived that director jan de bont more or less starts off his movie by metaphorically throwing open that door himself and yelling look everybody look it's a ten foot tall bug isn't that scary the law of diminishing returns immediately kicks in by the end of the movie the director is so to speak jumping up and down banging his cgi pots and pans madly and hoarsely screaming look everyone look here come ten hundred foot tall bugs and now here come a hundred thousand foot tall bugs br br the filmmakers apparently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this endeavor and there are many they can't and don't in fact impressive as they are the special effects are so insistent and obtrusive that the distracted viewer winds up staring at them whether in admiration or annoyance instead of being immersed in a story br br for me the nadir of this film's sheer stupidity comes when a statue with blood gushing from its mouth tries to drown liam neeson as dr marrow in a fountain the filmmakers clearly didn't know what to do with this alleged idea once they had it so they just have neeson thrash around in the water a bit flailing his arms and going glug glug by the next scene the good doctor has apparently dried himself off and ho hum forgotten all about the annoying incident br br shirley jackson's novel seems to have been dumbed down into this ridiculous screenplay by a committee of low iq teenage stoners who thought the way to frighten people was to make every effect bigger and louder okay next let's uh make the ceiling you know look like a creepy face and uh come down on her and all these spiky things like trap her in the bed br br the sole saving grace of the haunting is that it at last becomes so awful that it's actually funny by the time owen wilson as luke sanderson fell on the floor and then went on his magic carpet ride o' death i just about fell on the floor myself laughing br br badly constructed witless grotesquely heavy handed utterly unbelievable and filled with clunky dialogue and pointless scenes this vacuous haunting is a textbook example of how not to make a horror movie
<START> a novel by remarque a cast that looks great on paper a left wing refugee struggling to remain in paris between the wars a gestapo officer undercover br br it's a pity there's no synergy here the bits and pieces never coalesce br br stories about left wing refugees in france don't have to be this dull read arthur koestler's memoir scum of the earth if you can find it or his chilling dialogue with death ditto br br to me the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details br br the leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados the norman apple brandy i welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself it certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly but according to the film it's only sold in cheap low class saloons vive le tabac parisien that's what i say references to intoxicating liquors do abound here that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists br br i enjoy films set in france because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background i wasn't disappointed this time it was for byrrh a very unusual choice this film would rate a 10 if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals br br the film's indifferent score is by louis gruenberg gruenberg is best known if you can call it that for his opera the emperor jones based on the o'neill play it premiÃ¨red at roughly the same time as the film version starring paul robeson the opera survives today in a recording or two by lawrence tibbett it should surface again soon though they're running out of potentially marketable operas to revive br br opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since charles boyer's character operates under his czech aliases two of them are wozzeck and gunther both prominent roles in german opera is that just coincidence br br name dropping just seems to be part of this film notice that they call up himmelstoss on the phone himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in remarque's earlier all quiet on the western front br br well the in jokes are all in place guess there wasn't time to develop any drama
<START> i thought that mr dreyfuss was perfect for his role as the actor and the dictator his co star mr julia played his role equally as perfect it was interesting to see how reluctant richard dreyfuss was in replacing the dictator against his will but he became more confident and comfortable with the role as time passed since everything happens for a reason in life i believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was meant to stay there for over the year that he did i'm guessing that he stayed because he was supposed to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in parador i think he took too many things for granted in life and he needed to get a serious reality check by remaining in that country for as long as he did br br but anyways this is why i gave this film a 7 out of 10
<START> who did the research for this film it's set in baghdad in 2004 however all the soldiers are wearing acus and have all universal camouflage pattern gear no one was wearing that stuff in 04 br br i just saw this film while deployed overseas and i can say that the overwhelming feeling from the audience was wtf this movie made no sense had characters come and go with no explanation and people doing ridiculous things that would never happen in real life i realize that it's a movie but it's obviously trying to portray something realistic it fails miserably but it's trying br br it's like someone came up with a bunch of random ideas chewed them up and swallowed then vomited out a film i would not recommend this film to anyone i'm still not sure why i sat through the whole thing gi joe was one that really made you think compared to this stay away
<START> this film has been scaring me since the first day i saw it br br my mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in '92 i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my dad helped her up the stairs br br she was saying something like don't let her get me or something like that i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that she'd been watching the woman in black br br so obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me it scared the s out of me i've been immune to horror films since watching this
<START> i'm getting a little tired of people misusing god's name to perpetuate their own bigoted view on the world well i don't dismiss the idea of armageddon or the coming of the anti christ i do dismiss the idea that only certain people who live truly good lives they seem to be mostly white christian children will go to heaven while the rest of us must suffer through a millenia of hell on earth just because we weren't good enough god may be a judge but i don't think he is going to measure every level of goodness give the creator some credit
<START> this two parter was excellent the best since the series returned sure bits of the story were pinched from previous films but what tv shows don't do that these days what we got here was a cracking good sci fi story a great big really scary monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit some superb aliens in the ood the best new aliens the revived series has come up with a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters complete with a couple of unnamed expendable security people in true star trek fashion some large scale philosophical themes love loyalty faith etc and some top drawer special effects br br i loved every minute of this
<START> i read the novel some years ago and i liked it a lot when i saw the movie i couldn't believe it they changed everything i liked about the novel even the plot i wonder what did isabel allende author say about the movie but i think it sucks
<START> seriously why do american and frech actors pretending to be czechs need to speak perfect english with a fake russian accent i am a man so i enjoyed the gratuitous nudity but a soft porn flick would have more of that and at least wouldn't pretend it's artistic br br all the political statements where painfully didactic has the director heard of subtlety the acting was also woody and melodramatic and the comic relief was never funny the characters were very shallow and i just couldn't identify with them at all br br the bit where i did laugh was when they cut the actors into archival footage of the demonstrations in prague and they were black and white and then sepia to match the footage just ludicrous br br i read many of kundera's short stories not the unbearable lightness of being and there are good things about his style of writing although his themes are one big male fantasy and i have to say the film did not convey any of the goodness of kunderas style
<START> while the soundtrack is a bit dated this story is more relevant in the u s now more than ever with not only blue collar jobs but everyone's jobs being outsourced by u s corporations while the government profits and american suffer br br peter strauss is emory a steel worker who works the same job his father did for 35 years his wife is well portrayed by pamela reed who is very realistic trying to support the family with two children when emory loses his job the mill is closed under the pretext of mismanagement but there is also embezzlement and cheaper wages where they can pay one steelworker in one month outsourcing what they would have to pay strauss emory in a day never mind that these men are all good loyal workers who have values and try the best for their family br br john goodman gary cole as strauss' brother and a few other co workers are also affected it is very disturbing and realistic some scenes between emory and his father are moving emory hopes his local union will be able to re open the mill as they promise to do so br br emory's brother lee already sees the writing on the wall there are no jobs left in the rust belt ohio and they must move on however where in the u s can they move to where will it be better for a blue collar steel worker br br there is a triumphant scene at the end where emory and his crew fill the loading dock with steel products the guard allows them to do this as a final gesture one of the men committed suicide and he has empathy br br overall a good message film about hard times right here in america something that few care to face until personally affected 8 10
<START> michelle rodriguez plays diana a high school girl with an insolent scowl and 2 x 4 on her shoulder she's ready to battle anyone especially her father who is paying for her brother's boxing lessons diana decides boxing would be a good way of focusing her anger br br i liked the relationship between diana and adrian santiago douglas as adrian is excellent watch how their emotions towards each other are shaped by the squared circle
<START> this film is very interesting i have seen it twice and it seems glover hit the nail on the head with what he claims to he wants to accomplish i for one can relate to the outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center and the things that we as a culture are supposed to not think about due to corporate media control the outrage that glover expresses through the outrageous elements in the films is both clear in its visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in its poetic potency i am glad i saw this film and it is even clearer that glover is up to something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy it is fine everything is fine see that also people that dismiss this film as thoughtless or pretentious are really missing the boat this is an intelligent films if you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books that is also very wroth while the way you get in to his mindset is really something you will have an experience
<START> well i suppose the good news concerning william winckler's 2001 opus the double d avenger is that it manages to unite three of russ meyer's mammarian marvels kitten natividad haji and raven de la croix in one picture i can only assume that lorna maitland tura satana and babette bardot were busy the week they shot this thing or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance the bad news though and there's plenty of it is that this film if it can even be called that having been shot straight to video is a complete misfire a total abortion an out and out atrocity an absolute abomination and truly one of the worst pictures that i have ever seen look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made the plot here such as it is deals with kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in south america to cure her breast cancer oy and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in l a too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely you should pardon the expression flat that there is zero actual nudity in the film at all other than some old photos of kitten in her heyday and that some shaving cream and a papier mache boulder are the sum total of the special fx the meyer gals here are a bit long in the tooth saggy in the chest to put it kindly although sheri dawn thomas as bikini girl ooga boobies does manage to uh stand out nicely so why have i given this juvenile unfunny failed embarrassment of a movie 2 stars instead of 1 to be succinct joe bob briggs his voice over commentary in the special features of the dvd i just watched is absolutely hilarious especially when he pulls out around 100 synonyms for the word breast from the 1 000 on his web site's canonical hooters list the man is a national treasure and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status
<START> i can't say that wargames the dead code is the worst movie i've ever seen as it had one or two decent moments but i can easily say it's the most transparent movie i've ever seen not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it 10 minutes in advance there was no subtlety to anything the movie did no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes every spoken or typed line's intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to get into the movie br br i found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience far more often than i found myself enjoying the movie
<START> i read a few reviews of this tv movie which all said that the film dragged on for too long and that it was basically only sensationalistic entertainment i agree that perhaps the film goes on a bit too long 2h30 would have been enough but i certainly do not think it sensationalize the subject matter jim jones' expansive power trip and slow degradation into mental illness paranoia and drug abuse are never treated in a voyeuristic manner the movie takes its time in showing how jones recruited followers brenda vaccaro's and brad dourif's character are stand outs in that matter but also in observing an uncanny shift in jones' perception of reality it is mind boggling to see an egalitarian left wing and compassionnate preacher become such a destructive and cruel dictator perhaps the movie doesn't explore jones' motivations enough which can make the whole ordeal a bit superficial at times may have to do with censorship as well but powers boothe's mesmerizing performance makes it all come true i am not familiar with the details of the real jim jones' life but boothe sure makes the monster he plays believable and real the movie features many strong scenes among them the preaching messes of jones jones's meeting with father divine a remarquable james earl jones congressman leo ryan ned beatty 's visit to the guyana camp and of course the suicide scene it is quite a gloomy spectable to watch and boothe is quite commanding in those last moments madge sinclair shines in this scene as one of the suddenly sceptic follower and so do veronica cartwright as jones' wife and brad dourif especially when their time comes to drink the murderous potion the relative calm of the end of this scene the tasteful direction and the contrasting beauty of the natural surroundings all work in making those images quite impossible to erase from one's mind a disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses worth watching if only to keep in mind one of the truly horrific events of the 20th century not to let it be repeated again like ironically the inscription in jim jones' camp those who do not know the past are bound to repeat it
<START> this is not really a proper review since i did not see most of the film i stopped watching it the film is very violent with nasty drug dealers and street punks but that is not why i stopped watching br br here was the problem i watched just enough to be introduced to several characters all of whom were not interesting everyone was a tedious despicable psychopath with no engaging personalities giving me nothing to look forward to i found myself not the least bit curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them br br if there had been even one person of interest and i don't mean good or nice person i mean an interesting person i could have stayed with it watch state of grace to see what i mean in that film the gary oldman character is a complete lunatic but he is very interesting al pacino perhaps did a good job in scarface but his character just did not engage me
<START> it was such a treat when this show was on because it was such a fresh innovative and original show this makes every show i've ever watched look plain boring the moment the first episode aired i was entranced and i became attached to all the characters so easy which usually never happens because i always hate a few characters it is a pity this show won't have a third season because it has to be one of the best shows i have ever seen and that isn't exaggerating my feelings for the show at all nothing can ever replace pushing daisies because what could abc possibly find to replace this show this is easily the best show on television br br i came for kristin chenoweth and i stayed because i fell in love with the entire show
