<START> this complicated story begins fairly simply with an english journalist accepting a wager from edgar allen poe and his friend lord blackwood that he cannot spend a night in the haunted blackwood castle once there the writer wanders around the dusty rooms and corridors until music and a glimpse of a waltzing couple lead him into an empty room he sits at the harpsichord and starts to play the tune he has heard and is surprised to be tapped on the shoulder by the stunningly beautiful elizabeth blackwood she informs him with an ambiguous charming eerie manner that she has prepared his room upstairs and that someone is always expected on this night the night of the dead thus begins a startling series of supernatural events that bewilder the journalist all the rest of the night spoiler ahead it probably won't surprise too many viewers to learn that the lovely elizabeth is actually a ghost this doesn't prevent her from falling in love with the journalist but it does make things more complicated for them than for the average couple this is a fun movie with absolutely everything ghosts the spooky castle repeated visions of past events sex and violence though both have been toned down in the version most americans have seen over the years the alluring captivating barbara steele is the main reason to see it she has a strange charisma unlike anyone else you've ever seen in the movies recommended
<START> the notorious bettie page 2006 1 2 gretchen mol lilli taylor chris bauer jared harris sarah paulson david strathairn austin pendleton norman reedus dallas roberts br br mol shines as legendary pin up queen bettie page in a fine biopic br br gretchen mol is probably best known for being tauted as the next it girl a few years ago when no one knew who she was despite an infamous cover story by vanity fair among other media dubbings but despite a few co starring roles here and there her predicted stardom seemed to twinkle less brightly until now here as the famous pin up queen bettie page gretchen mol is indeed a shining star on the rise br br bettie page was tennessee born raised as a god fearing and family oriented proper girl who seemed to find herself the unwarranted object of lust and affection as she grew older a gang rape that is flashbacked is wisely not graphically depicted nor is the subtle showing of her own father having less than decent designs for his own kin which is important to understand how page managed to escape the possible nightmarish life for a career as an actress by heading to new york city in the 1950s when in fact that was the time and place to be to catch lighting in a bottle what page didn't realize is that in fact she would be just that when she arrived br br a beautiful raven haired sweetheart with a divine figure page is spotted on coney island one summer day by a black policeman asking to take her photograph which leads to her posing in his basement and eventually to the studios of irving klaw bauer and his sister paula taylor who cater their kitschy but considered pornographic stills to a unique clientele fetish types br br although page is rather naÃ¯ve she is undeniably smart and knows that her body is not a sin and can see the forest for the trees in the sense that she is in control or at least abides in what is offered her as work in that it is not indecent and she is having fun in her increasingly less clothed portraits until a congressional witch hunt seeks out a few scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime br br talented filmmaker mary harron and her screen writing partner guinevere turner an american psycho and i shot andy warhol streamline the biopic trappings rather neatly and maybe a bit too hasty in getting at who really was bettie page although they do justice in depicting an era of uptightness at its zenith large thanks to gifted cinematographer mott hopfel for his languorously gorgeous black and white images and also the sprinkled color segments that recall douglas sirk films of the era for its melodramatic kindlings part feminist treaty and part american dream fulfilled the story chugs along nicely with fine performances by its ensemble including the comical bauer and taylor as siblings in smut and harris having a field day as a fellow fotog with a taste for wine and chatter it's amusing to see strathairn in a bit of stunt casting as a senator on a campaign for righteousness after portraying news bulldog edward r murrow in his last outing good night and good luck as an opposite the table role br br but hats off to the truly fine talents of mol as the uninhibited yet deeply morale and most importantly intelligent bettie page who lets her child like innocence beam through her bold nudity and now considered tame and quaint borderline kitschy poses that caught the male fancy for decades and is still a bookmark for human sexuality in this country and perhaps the world overall mol is perfect and uncannily resembles her portrait's subject down to her knowing teasing smile the real bettie page was reportedly not involved with the project but apparently gave her blessing and continues to live a somewhat secluded life that is alluded to in the final moments as to having found jesus and shirking her 'notorious' image once and for all a shame since this film oddly embraces the resounding decency imbued within its subject radiating for all to see in its naked splendor
<START> this is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron the acting is second rate poor mathew modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film and god help gina gershon her accent is too over the top it sounds nothing like an true english woman it sounds forced and phony much like her acting she should stick to what she does best lesbian showgirl con artist who plays in a rock roll band and has a drug problem the other characters are no better they are two dimensional empty vapid and silly how are we to supposed to care about these people at one point christy scott cashman get's lost in central park really it's not that hard to navigate central park just follow any path out not only did i not care about any of the characters i downright hated them the only reason i even stayed with this train wreck of a film was fisher stevens even his brilliant humor couldn't save this dying fish each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us the script was awful as was the acting if you catch this fish throw it back
<START> this movie is a real gem the arc of the the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn their motives completely believable the dialogue is fresh and oh so real the situations are unique to the characters and not at all cliched or hackneyed until the climax that is then it's as if the movie went off the rails a bit and it got a bit hokey and unbelievable but i don't want to discourage people from watching this film the first 3 4's of it are truly remarkable i gave it an 8 there are some remarkable performances here check out this movie
<START> this film definitely gets a thumbs up from me it's witty jokes and even it's occasional stereotypical and derogatory views on eastern european people had me in stitches throughout most of the film it's plot is clever and 100 original and will have you guessing throughout the entire film the one person i was most impressed with in this film was hilary duff it's plain and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith stepped outside of the 'chick flick' genre she's used to her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well executed it is the best performance i have ever seen from hilary and i have seen most of her films her character yonica babyyeah is described as 'the britney spears of eastern europe' and this is seen in some of her mannerisms and the song 'i want to blow you up' you also feel sorry for her as her performance really grasps you yonica is a very complex and confused character joan cusack had me laughing throughout the whole film with her sometimes slapstick humour but also her facial expressions and so on john cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle throughout i strongly recommend this film
<START> taken in the context of the time it was made i found this a worthwhile movie while the details may be 'dramatized' the overall history was a nice primer in addition i found spotting actors i knew a real pleasure who would imagine ben cartwright as a dastardly cad i'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you as to the secondary casting this movie as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties has many an enjoyable character actor but top kudos' to andrew jackson's right hand man peavey the perfect touch of comedy well shot with beautiful ships and competent acting throughout out i recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp or an eye for a double period piece set at the dawn of america and made in a period when great names and top notch character actors were a real pleasure to enjoy
<START> i don't know what movie some of these other people watched but they must have seen a different joseph smith prophet of the restoration than the one i saw br br i think the movie was both well done and inspiring i think it's definitely worth watching it's apparent from the outset that a lot of care went into the making of this film the background scenery is beautiful br br i think the film does a good job of portraying joseph smith both as a man and as a prophet joseph's spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverence br br i would definitely recommend watching this movie
<START> i don't know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the movie business this movie short is gross to say the least it is a bunch of 5 7 year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins acting like adults and too much so however it is interesting because it is a good example of how the good old days may not have been so good after all thank god we have laws against this kind of material now br br this is one short from the shirley temple festival
<START> apparently this is what happens when a director allows his 14 year old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set while he indulges himself alcoholically in the meantime as i said earlier although i've always wanted to catch one of paul naschy's werewolf pictures this atrocity served as my introduction and as awful as it most certainly is i still intend to pursue other entries in the series albeit very gradually br br despite some high profile disappointments like joe dante's the howling 1981 i love werewolf pictures in general but to be honest i quickly lost interest in this film's plot and just stood there gazing at my tv screen counting its absurdities as it were there were far too many to mention them here but i have to say two which struck me as particularly hilarious were the schizophrenic nature of the werewolf persona i e going from a raging beast in one shot to a dazed zombie like state in the very next one as if he's on a casual midnight stroll in the countryside and sporting an entirely different wardrobe to boot and yes i did know the reasons for this beforehand as well as the phantom of the opera look of the wolfstein character but what do i know perhaps the elusive full length version of this mess could very well have been a bona fide horror classic
<START> i love killer insects movies they are great fun to watch i had to watch this movie as it was one of my favourite horror books by shaun hutson br br i have met him and i wish i did listen to him as this movie was terrible like he said it was after he said that i was still dying to see how bad it was br br the plot people are dying mysteriously and gruesomely and nobody has a clue what the cause is br br only health worker mike brady has a possible solution but his theory of killer slugs is laughed at by the authorities br br only when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from england begins snooping around does it begin to look like mike had the right idea after all br br this movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie slugs in this movie are fast then normal and it looks like they fast forwarding the scenes br br this movie is nothing like the book at all the book was ten times scarier ten times gory and had a lot more story to it br br i didn't like this movie at all as i am huge fan of slugs the book and second book called breeding ground both of books are great br br read the book then watch the movie you may like more then i did give this 2 out 10
<START> some of the acknowledged altman masterpieces seem sadder to me now maybe it's me like the last reviewer i even like this lesser altman shown recently on fmc although i don't think he was aiming at a wide audience organization politics as a microcosm for public campaigns some of this satirical docudrama is now dated like dick cavett watching the tonight show but i found much of the dialog funny and insightful e g you are for real that means you're no threat to anyone the story isn't profound but i liked it and the performances are funny especially cavett as himself lauren bacall as an aging conservative figurehead glenda jackson who actually became a member of parliament as a left wing ideologue in the opening scene lecturing someone dressed as a carrot on the sanctity of politics and carol burnett as a basket case all in the inimitable altman style although maybe not quite as inimitable as usual but pretty inimitable
<START> i know slashers are always supposed to be bad but come on what the hell is this it's like a bunch of 10 year olds saved their lunch money and started filming this by the end of their week br br anyway six young people all go to the same house to get killed off screen we have the brainy one the slut the other slut the black guy the killer stereotypes like that after one gets eaten by a shaking boat the others all get stalked by some guy who wears a mask the people at the poor box rejected there's one pretty decent murder somewhere in the middle but then it's back to even more boredom and especially more false scares seriously we actually know it can't be the killer when a person gets attacked because the guy sure loves to take his sweet time for everything br br after every character you expected to die dies the standard ugly blonde chick and her soon to be boyfriend eventually get captured by the killer they get like pushed down and then faint and the killer reveals himself i think the writers of this movie just took a blindfold and a pen and put it somewhere on the list of characters the motive is just lame and don't even get me started on the damn secret the killer then of course takes way too much time to explain everything and then about ten minutes extra in which he slices up his own arm for some reason and eventually gets overpowered by a guy with a gun hey no fair br br really one of the most awful movies i've ever seen i could enjoy myself more by watching a lindsay lohan movie i swear i mean sure most 80's slashers sucked as well but at least they threw in some t a this movie just has nothing going for it
<START> two films are useful for scaring people to god this and 'event horizon' one has a significant and poignant message the other is as one dimensional as a religious movie can get too bad paul anderson went on to the accursed resident evil movies he really had something going br br thief in the night is hampered by many obvious independent film attributes acting storytelling dialog and persuasion and it's obvious what the film's intentions are from the start the christian film industry hasn't learned from the failures of this so we are stuck with the omega code left behind and the other tribulation movies their underlying element is that they are so concerned with selling their message get saved folks that everything else becomes second to whacking the audience over the head with a bible br br overall i can't believe i'm even writing this much about a movie this ineffective skip it entirely and go back to sam neil gouging out his eyeballs 1 out of 5
<START> i am not sure who is writing these br br glowing reviews for this movie but trust me it stkinks i have seen hundreds of horror films and slasher flicks and this one is lame it is only about 80min long and believe me that is all i could take plot is terrible acting is even worse and there is no development at all br br even the david cocteau films are better than this run away from jigsaw i expected to hate the acting which can be forgiven in direct to video movies if the plot is good br br this had no scares very little gore br br and a truly unattractive cast br br i watched this with three other friends br br who i hope are still talking to me br br they wanted me to fling the disc out the window i can not believe anyone could have br br given this tripe a good review
<START> rather annoying that reviewers keep comparing this to planet earth of course planet earth is better it has much much more of the same earth is like an extended trailer for the planet earth series and as such is inevitably inferior and simplified but that is not comparing like with like br br as a feature length documentary or actually as a feature length anything it surpasses pretty much anything you will see in your entire life unless you choose to traverse the earth in helicopters with long range cameras for years on end and wait for months in the most extreme environments to catch a glimpse of the most extraordinary beings on earth which lets face it is unlikely br br on the narration yes everyone in the uk very much including me adores david attenborough and there's little excuse for him not to be narrating here but that hardly deserves knocking down a star or three he wasn't a presenter on planet earth just a narrator and i'm sure he's modest and gracious enough to realise that anything that gets more viewers in is a good thing br br anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by its awe majesty and glory all reviewers agree on that those who love it ie everyone will should go on to see an buy planet earth so three cheers for its cinematic release and a big boooo for anyone cheap enough to buy this on dvd rather than the planet earth box set but as works of art they're not in competition here people br br the earth is big enough for both
<START> i was really really disappointed with this movie it started really well and built up some great atmosphere and suspense but when it finally got round to revealing the monster it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems again whoop de do yet another nutjob movie like we don't already have enough of them br br to be fair the creep is genuinely unsettling to look at and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy but i'm sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human albeit a twisted demented freakish one when i saw all the tell tale rats early on i was hoping for some kind of freaky rat monster hybrid thing it was such a let down when the creep was revealed br br on top of this some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense spoiler br br why the hell does the creep kill the security guard whats the point apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says hi i'm a psycho and i live down here its stupid and only seems to happen to prevent franka potente's character from getting help br br what the hells he been eating down there i got the impression he was effectively walled in and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose so has he been munching rats all that time and if so why do they hang around him so much why is he so damn hard to kill he's thin malnourished and not exactly at peak performance but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that cripple the non psycho characters in the film br br the dvd commentary says we are intended to empathise with creep but i just find him loathsome its an effective enough movie but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick
<START> this movie is unbelievably ridiculous i love horror movies but this is the worst one i've ever seen i am a huge fan of gore but most of the deaths in this movie aren't shown it just shows us the already dead bodies and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are terrible the graphics look so obviously fake the actors are awful as well there is no real emotion from any of them not only did i waste my time watching this piece of sh t movie but i had to subject myself to actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it if i could rate this a 10 i would f ck this movie it's crap br br don't watch it
<START> i got this film about a month ago and i am now a fanatic fan of drew barrymore's i love a happy ending and this film gives a brilliant one with the truths of red sox slotted in it's about a maths teacher who takes some promising kids on a maths trip to a company where the successful lindsey drew shows them some information this then leads in the ben teacher and lindsey dating but it isn't all simple when he confesses he is a massive red sox fan br br first of all things are fine but then his baseball gets in the way of lindseys life it's all fine in the end and it took one shot to get drew running across the field i got it for two quid in blockbusters so i was happy if you like films like this i suggest you see some more of drew's work like charlie's angels and 50 first dates or even her new film with hugh grant in called music and lyrics
<START> shintarÃ´ katsu who played the blind swordsman zatoichi in a total of 27 movies ends the hanzo trilogy with this excellent film in which he gets to make love to a ghost mako midori blind beast br br the big stick used often in the pursuit of justice is retired forever br br katsu was his usual impudent self as he pursued those who would steal from the treasury to lend at usurious amounts to those who could not afford to pay br br the usual amazing swordplay and skill of the big guy was present along with the blood br br i'm going to miss him
<START> this movie is difficult to watch in our fast paced culture of the 21st century but it is worth it for the messages that it conveys chiefly the consequences and ramifications of technology upon society specifically when that technology is used for warfare br br this movie presents a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization as influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a cautionary tale against the misuse of technology but as the circle completes itself familiar themes and sentiments pop up again to present self serving rather than self destructive ways that humanity may utilize technology br br brilliant for it's time the picture and sound quality may pose a challenge for some but as a landmark in the history development and evolution of the sci fi genre it is a must in the end free will and free choice are once again posed to humanity as a means for controlling our own destiny rather than having it served to us by someone else or indeed the state of br br society itself as shaped by world events br br those who are downtrodden by what life throws their way sometimes tend to remain so but yet there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains as this film posits br br as far as qualifying as sci fi one of the biggest common demoninators of that genre is it's speculative nature it asks us the questions what if these events happened this way and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it how would we react br br as far as influence this film projects those speculative sciences that make sci fi as unique as it is and keeps us asking those important questions
