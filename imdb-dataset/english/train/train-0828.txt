<START> moonwalker is a fantasy music film staring michael jackson with different segments i will rate each segment individually br br segment 1 opens the film with a music video the music video is a concert of michael jackson performing the song man in the mirror the music video also show's montages of historical figures such as gandhi martin luther king jr john lennon and more the first segment was a good choice to open the film i liked the song and also loved the montage of the historical figures i even loved the message in the song i give the first segment a 9 10 br br segment 2 shows a montage of michael jackson's start from the jackson five to his solo career the montage i thought was well made i liked the animation they put into it and i also loved their choices of songs such as i i want you back beat it thriller can you feel it and the way you make me feel the only thing i wish they could have done a little a better in one of the songs in the montage is we are the world the reason why is all you see is rain drops and in those drops are images of michael jackson and the chorus of the celebrities but it's a little hard to see the chorus other than that the segment is still good i give it a 9 10 br br segment 3 is the song bad you're probably thinking it's michael jackson's music video of bad well yes and no this segment is the music video but it's redone by kids the segment was cute but it wasn't as good as the other segments i give it a 6 10 br br segment 4 is a short claymation music film that takes place after the kid's version of bad called speed demon the short is about michael jackson being chased by his beloved fans and the press and he disguises himself as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle to try to get away from them the claymation in the chase sequence was great but some parts in the film the claymation characters looked a little fake when they interact with real people also at the end of the clip out of nowhere michael jackson rabbit costume comes to life and he's dancing with it i liked the dancing but that was like out of nowhere i give it a 8 10 br br segment 5 is michael jackson's grammy winning music video leave me alone the music video is about the media poking their nose at michael jackson's personal life and michael jackson feels they won't leave him alone no matter how much he's proved innocent the music video really speaks out but keep in mind this happened before the child molestation this just all about the rumors of him in the 80's but i didn't feel this video should be in this movie because it's a kids movie and i don't think kid's will understand what he's singing about i give this music video 8 10 br br segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole movie called smooth criminal michael jackson plays a gangster who uses his powers of a wishing star as a crime figure to protect children including john lennon's son sean lennon from an evil mobster named mr bigg played by joe pesci the segment i thought really brought out the film especially when he danced and sang the song smooth criminal with a bunch of criminals i also thought the special effects were good the weird thing about the segment is why are kids hanging out with a grown man it never explained why also joe pesci character talks about drugs and what he plans to do with them i mean why would you talk about drugs in a kids film other wise it was good my rating for this segment is a 8 10 br br segment 7 is the final segment of the whole movie the film end's with michael jackson singing a cover version of the beatle's song come together and then during the credit's we see michael jackson singing with ladysmith black mambazo michael did a good cover of come together and i think it was good idea putting including a group of good singer's with a talented musican like him my rating is 9 10 br br this movie is a good michael jackson film i think it really brings out children s imagination the film is almost as imaginative as the beatles animated movie yellow submarine if you like michael jackson and you're up to a film with a lot of creativity this is the film my overall rating for this movie is 8 10
<START> it has very bad acting bad story lines bad characters you should never see this show if you see it on turn it off or you be cringing for the next 30 minutes it should have never been aired it's not great you should never see it never ever ever so now if you ever wanna watch this show please don't turn to the the cw for smallville or disney channel for hannah montana wizards of waverly place or nick for drake josh those are much better family shows so believe me on this i've watched it before and it is honestly and i say honestly the worst show i've ever seen and i've seen a lot of tv so do me a favor and never watch this show
<START> say what you want about andy milligan but if his family was even 10 as deranged as the one in this film well then i guess he could have turned out worse unfortunately the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the picture's box office appeal several times during the film milligan's ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends and suddenly good looking stand ins for milligan's homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic 60's guitar rock it's pretty easy to fast forward through if you're trying to pay attention to milligan's original film which unfortunately is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes what remains however is still compelling stuff i don't think i've ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before
<START> one of the most frightening game experiences ever that will make you keep the lights on next to your bed great storyline with a romantic horrific and ironic plot fans of the original resident evil will be in for a surprise of a returning character not to mention that the voice acting have drastically improved over the previous of the series don't miss out on the best of the series
<START> anyone who has studied any physics or cognitive science will walk out disgusted after 40 min as my wife and i did the ignorant masses might be entertained by the hand waiving arguments and the absurd conclusions drawn without even an attempt at a logical reason from real science i'm offended by such nonsense presented under the guise of science i can only conclude that the writers picked up a quantum physics book didn't understand a word of it then watched the matrix about a thousand times and proceeded to write this movie br br for example the washington dc crime experiment was done by the transcendental meditation program a brief search will reveal the science of their methods http www freedomofmind com resourcecenter groups t tm dissenter htm br br save your money
<START> famous was famous for their tension and release style of cartoon where the semi main character is in terrible peril only to be rescued by the hero at the last second this particular casper is the only one i can remember where death actually takes a hand but even in death there is still a happy ending br br the constant in famous studios cartoons is that virtue always triumphs popeye always gets to his spinach in time baby huey always out foxes the fox little audery always learns her lesson and some fs cartoons are really dark and depressing br br you have to give them credit as much as i love looney tunes and tom and jerry i don't think anyone was putting out a better cartoon product at that time than paramount color animation music the great winston sharples editing voices they were consistent and a glowing example of the best that the art form had to offer
<START> some people might call paulie a kids' movie but i wish to assert that it's more than that probably more than anything else this movie successfully goes to great lengths to show the plight of immigrants in the united states topical given the recent debates portraying a parrot telling a russian immigrant janitor tony shalhoub of how he searched america for his original owners the movie tells several stories there's the elderly woman gena rowlands whom he befriends then a mexican immigrant cheech marin and others br br all in all it's a very well done movie i usually don't expect much from these sorts of movies but this one is a treat i certainly recommend it also starring jay mohr buddy hackett bruce davison hallie eisenberg and trini alvarado
<START> i read about this movie in a magazine and i was intrigued a woman who one day sees herself drive past in her own car well i thought this could be interesting br br but it isn't first the title the broken the broken what what is broken the oh wait i get it the title itself is broken wow clever unfortunately this is virtually the only thing going for it br br the premise is not that bad but i think kiefer suderland did much better in 'mirrors' a cross between invasion of the body snatchers and mirrors and a rather mediocre one at that a more suited title would be 'the boring' since it draws out every single scene for bloody ages or maybe 'the confusing' since it doesn't explain anything at all not in the narrative nor in the story itself only some vague idea about evil copies and somesuch dotted with cheap scares and scenes used to death but nothing tangible it's just messed up br br on the other hand the acting and the special effects are quite good but then again it's not a difficult role to act br br after watching the movie twice i still feel unsatisfied a little confused maybe and not in the e a poe or stephen king kind of way do yourself a favor and don't watch this one simply put there are better thrillers out there
<START> in the hands of lesser actors than claudette colbert and robert ryan this film could have become silly and trite but with these two experienced thespians leading the way i found silent fury to be a most exciting and pleasurable little mystery when their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that colbert is already married and that he was best man at that wedding one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work as colbert ryan and her attorney set out to disprove the strangers claim of a prior marriage they are met at every turn by more evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is indeed already wed although it's not very difficult to figure out just who the main baddie is it's still lots of fun as the intensity and pace of the story increases all in all a good solid mystery film with fine performances by the two leading actors and a fine supporting cast which includes the often underrated paul kelly
<START> return of the jedi is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right and that is a shame because the last chronological installment in the star wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling it manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale and does so very convincingly br br yes there are ewoks cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the star wars demographic and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader the most recognizable villain in movie history br br return of the jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline which went from slightly implausible in the empire strikes back to very convincing here an exciting opening at jabba's palace a masterful performance of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor luke finally coming into his own the resolution of solo and leia's romance and the extremely powerful final moments on the endor moon br br yes there are slight annoyances but they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to nitpick every single scene it's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter it's not a 'good' movie it's fantastic
<START> i liked this movie a lot i rented this expecting something not too bad to spend an evening it turned out a particularly satisfying experience some scenes were hilarious and managed to be so in a movie not intended to be just a stupid slapstick comedy but with some meaning and moral values it manages on both counts the leads are all good but especially the guy who stars also wrote and produced the movie i've never seen any of these actors before but they were likable and made me care about what happens to them in the end which is saying a lot the script is clever and involving and has a refreshing feel to it i think you wont be disappointed to watch this
<START> finally a movie where the audience is kept guessing until the end what will happen well we all kind of know that the lives of the brothers andy played by hoffman and hank played by hawke will spiral downward towards destruction since where else is there to go but down but we do not know how or when until near the end of the movie hoffman is superb as usual and even hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told since he really cannot think for himself hawke might have been a little out of his element but he played the part well enough add into this mix andy's wife played perfectly by marisa tomei cheating with hank andy's embezzlement of company funds to pay for his drug and sex addictions and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened the day of the robbery this movie will get you thinking
<START> this is available on a drive in double feature from dark sky films and since i just had finished up barracuda i watched this too this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time br br we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town but where exactly are they they stop to look at necklaces from some chinese vendor and try on chinese style clothes at a shop but then we see some aztec dancers and all the while these girls are being followed by two guys who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn't have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town and they finally catch them br br it seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck and these guys want to find the loot and where did she get it so in flashback we go back to find out and how did they know she had this coin hard to say really br br now back in the day when these two women were 10 years old they were out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends on a boat and after stopped to get air in their tanks they tow this young boy back to his home dock only to have his grandpa come out invite the young 'uns up for herbal tea with granny but not everyone has the tea todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls and then when they're away from it the boat blows up and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared well it seems as though these kindly folk raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell and serve it herbal tea br br but the girls and todd did leave the island but now they're returning escorted by their captors and they're there to find the treasure despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before there also seems to be someone else on the island and the thugs mysteriously begin to die one by one and since there's only three it doesn't take long and there's even a sort of happy ending which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film br br the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues and combined with no acting ability they're borderline hilarious the hillbilly type family is also devoid of acting ability despite the fact that the grandpa is hank worden who appeared in many films and tv shows the action is confusing the locales are even more confusing and the island looks like southern california br br so what the hell is this i'm not sure but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think or say huh 4 out of 10 very bizarre
<START> david lynch's crude and crudely drawn take on south park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clichÃ©s about suburban middle class families the father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth hole from which are uttered the most horrendous guttural noises the son and mother are permanently horrified incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life a number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series br br lynch is not famous for his comedies i e on the air aspects of wild at heart and i am not particularly fond of comedies in general however there were a couple of scenes in dumbland which made me laugh out loud there are some clever bits of animated cinematography where lynch conveys wide ranges of reaction in his characters through a syntactical arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions which never really vary in dumbland br br i believe lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight forward if disturbing animated comedy here interestingly he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra low brow humor i e most will farrell films while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and gross out humor while the blend doesn't really work very well here it is nothing if not lynchian br br worth seeing by lynch fans
<START> loc could have been a very well made movie on how the kargil war was fought it had the locations the budget and the skill to have been india's saving private ryan or black hawk down instead it come across as a bloated 4 hour bore of trying to meld the war move with the masala movie even the war scenes were terribly executed using the same hill in all their battle scenes and spending unnecessary time on casual talk instead of trying to appeal to the indian public a better movie would have been a to the book account of what happened at kargil like black hawk down or even spending time on the militant point of view like tora tora tora even better it could have used a competent director like ram gopal verma to write direct and edit the film until then i'd like to see some one re edit this film with only the pertinent portions included it would make the movie more watchable
<START> at first i didn't didn't like it that much although i did they didn't include the third trueba generation the love between blanca and pedro wans't well explained and some actors were too different from what i had imagined br br later i realized that had the movie been more loyal to the book it would have been like five hours long and would be kind of tedious now i like it very much because my favourite characters are there as i portraited them clara really looks like an angel in live and her introduction to the story at the beggining of the film was fantastic loyal and short glenn close is ferula i pictured her just like that only not in mourning throughout the whole thing esteban is find enough i never really liked his character and although i was interested in him i hated him a lot more specially when he hit clara as in the book the very last part is the most exciting one and it has real history too there br br the movie is really good specially considering that it was a gringo film based upon a latin american book its amazing how many famous stars are there don't you think so
<START> today's sci fi thrillers are more like rambo in outer space with monster special effects frequently ludicrous such as sounds of explosions in the vacuum of space though tame by today's standards the special effects of forbidden planet were quite striking for their time even today they still hold plausibility yet the best part of the movie is perhaps the reason that radio thrillers still have appeal much of what was going on was left up to the imaginations of the audience what did the krell creatures look like by having much of the framework of the story never divulged or only divulged in the end the tension and suspense held throughout the movie the ending was also very thought provoking and satisfying in my mind this is still one of the best if not the best sci fi films ever made
<START> o my gosh just give me a minute to breath this movie takes you on an awesome ride and doesn't let you go until the very last blow in your face ending this is the the movie for fans of stormriders and such legend of zu was beautifully created although i didn't like a few things they used alot of stand ins i wanted to see the real person fight but oh well a few small let downs and i didn't really like it a lot until i watched it again when you understand it more it totally kicks a i encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true asian movie to see this movie i give this movie one of my highest ratings go and see it when it comes out in america
<START> in another one of bugs bunny's hare raisingly wacky shorts the famous leporid works in a department store display case when owner gildersleeve decides to stuff him of course this proves nearly impossible as bugs apparently knows the store better than gildersleeve and knows when to cross dress as always they keep everything coming at top speed and so you have to wonder how hilarious this cartoon must have seemed when it first debuted among other things hare conditioned is a fine example of how the looney tunes looked in the '40s before the termite terrace crowd polished them but don't get me wrong the cartoons were still really good after the refined forms arrived br br anyway this is a great one br br leporids are rabbits and hares
<START> the gingerbread man is the first thriller i've ever done Â robert altman br br in 1955 charles laughton directed the night of the hunter a spooky slice of southern gothic in which robert mitchum plays a scary serial killer one of the film's more famous sequences consists of two kids escaping from mitchum on a rowboat the kids frantically paddling whilst mitchum wades after them like a monster br br seven years later mitchum played an equally spooky killer in cape fear another film set in the american south that film featured a local attorney trying to protect his family and likewise ended with mitchum terrorising folks on a boat in 1991 martin scorsese trying to branch out and tackle something more mainstream remade cape fear boat scene and all br br now we have robert altman's the gingerbread man another slice of small town southern gothic altman says he consulted the night of the hunter for inspiration and tackled such a mainstream film purely because he wanted to spread his wings and try a popcorn picture but what he's secretly attempting to do here is deconstruct the canonical films of the southern gothic genre br br so instead of a showdown on small boat we get a showdown on a giant ship instead of two kids being kidnapped we get two kids being safely returned to the police instead of money being hidden we have money being readily given via a last will and testament instead of the righteous attorney of the 1961 film and the deplorable attorney of the 1991 remake we get a rather three dimensional lawyer in kenneth branagh instead of the monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the bad guys instead of the monster breaking into the family's house boat we have the hero hunting the monster on board the monster's house ship similarly instead of a murderous serial killer we get an innocent weirdo played by robert duvall etc etc etc br br altman goes on and on reversing everything just a little slightly pulling at the edges and doing his own thing his touch is most apparent during the film's first half hour the film existing in an uneasy space between conventional plot driven movie storytelling and altman's fondness for overlapping dialogue casual narratives prowling camera movement and the way that characters aren't so much introduced as they are simply part of what's going on br br still despite altman's best intentions the film never rises above mediocrity altman's too bound to the conventions of the thriller format to do much damage his style is too lethargic to generate tension and the film is simply not radical enough to counterpoint other canonical films in the genre gingerbread man is thus too mainstream to work as a more pure altman film and too altman to work as a mainstream thriller br br the film's not a complete waste though robert downey junior kenneth branagh and the usually intolerable daryl hannah all turn in juicy performances the film also has a nice atmosphere set against a approaching hurricane and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns while it's not the complete disaster that scorsese's cape fear was the film still never amounts to anything special br br 7 10 Â in the late 90s altman made 3 successive films set in the american south kansas city gingerbread man and cookie's fortune unlike gingerbread man both kansas city and cookie's fortune tackle the genre on the broader more looser canvases that altman was most comfortable with br br kansas city is the more important of these two films its hierarchies of class politics and crime and its desire to break radically away from typical gangster genre frameworks would prove influential on all serious 21st century film crime writers see for example the wire that said cookie's fortune while a much slighter tale is perhaps the better picture br br note altman claims that this is his first thriller but he directed images an art house thriller in 1972 br br worth one viewing
