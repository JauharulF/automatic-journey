<START> watched this film having really enjoyed gregory's girl many years ago this was drivel the plot was vaguely distasteful with the teacher and his friend perving over 14 15 year old girls in very short skirts previous commenters seem to think that this doesn't matter but i found it rather nasty if you have children at school then the last thing you want is to think that every youngish teacher is lusting after his pupils we were surprised that the censor let that through apart from that the film was just a waste of time the script was poor and john gordon sinclair trying too hard to recreate his schoolboy image slightly wacky and off the wall why anyone would want to lust after him in this performance is incredible this film failed on all counts for me dreadful please don't waste your time watching it life's too short
<START> plotwise this is a rather silly little whodunnit masquerading as a period drama biopic br br however the only reason i wanted to see it in the first place was because i was curious about what the great henry fonda was really like at his peak i wasn't disappointed he produces a truly warm and charismatic performance br br in addition i can honestly say that i was never really bored at any stage during the film so a strong 1 2 out of
<START> there is no way on earth you are going to care about any of these characters a bunch of spoilt middle class overgrown kids take some drugs at a party and get off with each other and argue i've just seen this on tv and i didn't think it was a 'film' as such more a post 'this life' indulgence that really has no resonance or proper drama to it stuff like this will get commissioned for time immemorial unfortunately irrelevant middle class lifestyle crap that takes itself far too seriously it's got david baddiel in it and that bird out of cold feet you know what to expect there was a lot of this stuff about in 2000 it was a particularly british malaise they're educated and doing drugs friends but kinda dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships sounds great this kind of nonsense and post guy ritchie comedy gangster stuff dark days if you have taste this will annoy you to the point of violence
<START> what can i say about cruel intentions 2 well i can say in all honesty i will only watch this film again if i am fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork orange style br br the film 'stars' robin dunne no i never heard of him either whose awful impression of ryan phillipe made me cringe throughout in a case of terrible casting dunne attempts and fails to carry off playing a handsome charismatic charmer since the actor is not handsome nor charismatic nor charming the character is left wholly unbelievable amy adams she was in an episode of buffy one time tries to pick up where sarah michelle gellar left off and bring scheming katherine to life however adams is not that good a an actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion often she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera there were two good actors in the film however barry flatman saw 2 saw 3 and mimi rogers mrs kensington in austion powers made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of sebastian and katherine and are the only reason why i rated the film as a 2 not a 1 br br the film itself is a poor version of the original with such lows as carbon copy's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which lacked the originality of the previous film br br i think that as a tv show it might have worked but if it had been recasted with people who could actually act in the main parts
<START> to those who say that this movie deserves anything below the unflaunting grace that it showed i disagree this is an amazing documentary about a shocking day br br imdb asks us to rate this movie i beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made the courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable we find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened they continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own and eachother's safety to judge whether it's nobler to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the lives as those amazing amazing firefighters did is not mine to answer i just know that in 30 years a class full of children will not know one without the other br br i submit a wholehearted 10 this is why the art of filming was created to capture the natural emotion that real life offers you can keep your kung fu junk romance is cute action will never reach this level this movie 9 11 will be timeless in that it did not glorify itself it didn't have a sneak peek it didn't have all of the blatant vanities that a lion's share of the many movies on the many screens blare it had class composure substance and it had a record of the day that changed the modern face of america and even the world it spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera please consider this movie as it itself proclaims a stirring tribute to all of those who fell because of the free beautiful name of america br br how can you give anything less to a movie that shows not embellishes the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times i love the godfather but 9 11 is forever a different kind of movie as this is now a different kind of world it is art without question or questions br br jf
<START> this is an extremely long movie which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathies br br if you are moved by the guilt of the loathsome you will find it particularly heart wrenching because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak if you can love a monster you'll cry for magnus pym the spy who betrays everyone notably his country his friends and family a man who has also been manipulated and moulded since childhood by those same people br br there isn't one truly likeable character in the entire story not one loyal 'moral' personality to sympathise with but watching the whole thing without the help of a tissue would be quite remarkable br br i really enjoyed it in the end well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character
<START> the story line has been rehashed a number of times a breath of life in the retirement home several plays movies novels short stories poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end but it's still an excellent platform for character studies br br if 'gideon' was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches even the subtitle and summary of gideon's simple wisdom almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors' lack of focus almost irrelevant
<START> and that goes especially for lawyers cops puerto rico which boasts of a small but potent film production firm brings this multi layered tale of corruption due to the on going drug cartel that starts in south america makes a pit stop on the island commonwealth and then northbound into north america steven bauer the most recognizable face on screen here leads a cast of top notch actors in a story of can you spot the only respectable face in the crowd ricardo mendez matta moves up from directing mainly action adventure fare for american television in a screenplay written by matta along with poli marichal the rest of the cast elpidia carrillo magda rivera jose herredia luz maria randon to mention a few turn in oh so fine roles in a film that will keep you wondering is there any respectable characters here spoken in spanish with english subtitles rated 'r' by the mpaa this film contains outbursts of vulgar language brief flashes of nudity adult content violence some of which is quite lurid
<START> when you look back at another bad nightmare sequel like freddy's revenge you have to at least give it some credit for trying something new and although the dream child is more enjoyable it offers absolutely nothing new to the series yes there's the creative deaths as usual like a kid becoming part of a comic book and facing super freddy but even scenes like that aren't used to their full potential and the parts without freddy are just boring br br this marked the official death of scariness to the series freddy seems to be the comedic relief now but to what br br my rating 4 10
<START> what people fail to understand about this movie is that it isn't a beginning middle and end it is just the conclusion of a 26 episode long tv series so remember that when you all talk about how the world wasn't explored enough that was all done in the tv show br br as great and stunning as the visuals are i think the spoilers argument between lian chu and gwizdo near the end of the film was what really made me love this movie seeing characters i had followed through 26 episodes fight like that was agonizing and seeing gwizdo walking sadly off by himself amidst the floating ruins while lian chu sharpened his blade was almost tear jerking br br then we got a total contrast with lian chu fighting these insanely awesome dragons which had been featured before in the series while gwizdo is babbling insanely and indirectly threatening to kill zoe shudder i'm surprised that this particular scene hasn't been mentioned more in the warnings any kid that has a lick of sense will be able to see that gwizdo wasn't himself and was fully intent on strangling that little girl it was enough to bother me and i'm 15 br br the world is amazing the plot is a lot better than most multi million blockbusters and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters go check it out
<START> my first impression would be this is beowulf only with all the good bits of fighting grendel and dragons intact making it one thrill ride from start to end written by frederic lanoir and arthur qwak the two of them had created a fantastical landscape that becomes a character in itself within their story with its ever changing environment made up of small spheres of land floating around which can either be wastelands or globes of greenery br br the story's a simple one which tells of a land which is cowering in the expectation of a mighty dragon's unwanted visit to plunder and destroy and the resident knights have all but been annihilated enter the king's granddaughter zoe marie drion who gathers lian chu vincent lindon a huge brute with immense strength but truly a gentle giant and his partner in arms gwizdo patrick timsit who balances the partnership with his cunning brain lian chu and gwizdo together with their pet creature which too proudly spews incipient fires share a common dream of owning a farm land and spending idyllic days tending to their farm animals in retirement but in order to do that comes the requirement of being financially free hence their career in monster extermination which doesn't exactly pay off br br that's basically the whole gist of it but what makes this film a spectacle is its cg graphics which is solidly rich detailed and an eye popping marvel to behold it has some wonderfully crafted set action pieces that were painstakingly designed to draw you into the thick of the action and during those fight sequences there's nary a boring moment photo realistic moments of non existent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of make belief and it's easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual three suns and a kaleidoscope of flying thingamajigs here's having at you george and i couldn't get enough of the finale battle as well though the usual brick bats will find some fault at the indestructibility of the principle characters br br i guess this film had opened my eyes that there are many more computer animated companies out there around the world that have quality in their product to match that of pixar's and this is definitely a movie that the local filmmakers of zodiac the race begins and legend of the sea can learn from Â to keep the story effectively simple and let your moving artwork do all the talking definitely highly recommended
<START> one thing i'm sure everyone who has seen this film will agree on is that it is very creepy the other films in polanski's unofficial trilogy are creepy too but they are all different in what makes them creepy but they all roughly deal with the same thing they all deal with the mind definitely the staring people are very creepy each of them sent shivers down my spine that made me incapable of sitting still again if you have seen the other two films mentioned i'm sure you'll find this quite creepy because you begin to expect typical polanski traits that you think you have caught onto he is aware of this and will keep teasing you with simple things personally every time trelkovsky would slowly turn around i would be bracing myself for a jump maybe that's just me but it felt intended to do that though it was quite subtle there is no build up of the music in those moments br br the acting in this was pretty good mostly that from polanski of course the other characters in the film don't have all that much time to outshine the lead polanski really proves himself as an all round great filmmaker he not only can direct and write great films but he can actually act too i don't think there is any other better person who could have pulled off the trelkovsky character polanski settled right on in perfectly i like seeing films where the director is also apart of the main cast to me it really highlights their fantastic versatility and talent which i respect greatly br br one thing i didn't like about this film is how it was done in english for those who don't know this is a french film american financed and as well to make it more commercially successful it was mostly done in english there are parts which it is very obvious there has been dubbing and i don't know why it is but 3 4 of the time when there is a dub they get the complete wrong person to do the dub there is a women in the film who when she speaks it's obvious it's a dub but they got the most annoying person to do the voice over it was seriously pain to my ears to hear her speak she had the loudest high pitch voice i've heard in a while it almost seemed fake but i don't see what the point was she was a rather small character i honestly would of preferred if they just left it as it was filmed parts of it in french and parts of it in english because the dubbing in this film was a pain and was not near two completely different films i know the high standard of another film that did a similar thing which was the good the bad and the ugly i realise it's not a big problem just when you do realise it it gets annoying but i'm sure you won't sit there the long trying to lip read what they are actually saying regardless if you know french br br whats so great about polanski is that he will let you think you know him that you know his style which in some aspects you do but really you can't see whats behind that corner this film is a lot more open to interpretation than the other two films mentioned which i think really strengthens this one in particular i personally feel this is the best of the three i'm unsure which comes next but they are all relatively close in their level of greatness the ending is fantastic it is so easy to dwindle on it for a long time to come and get nowhere i choose not to think to much on it just to have my personal opinion and leave it at that br br i've rambled on and i haven't really given any insight on what makes this film so great i don't think so i'll quickly do it here if you liked repulsion and or rosemary's baby i guarantee you will enjoy this film to say the least for those who are too unfortunate to have seen either then i recommend you check this film out if your looking for something that is quite a creepy film that is quite intelligent particularly the end as well if your looking for something that deals with the mind paranoia even though that is better fitted under repulsion
<START> yeti deserves the 8 star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made i saw it at a midnight screening in l a and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and then it does the millionaire who funds the project to thaw the yeti looks like chris penn and john goodman both poured into an ill fitting suit the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen and yes there is a mute boy who sorta kinda looks like a girl and he's mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents hmmm maybe therapy for the kid then this hottie italian girl is seen by yeti once he thaws which takes forever and he is instantly in love with her what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant yeti makes bedroom eyes at her it's like a large barry white trying to seduce a groupie in fact once the large yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest she accidentally touches the yeti's nipple and yes the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple get hard yikes of all yikes plus there's a collie dog in it because the italian producer must have heard that american audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a lassie there's also this insane scene where the yeti eats a giant fish keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the italian girl's hair gee thanks yeti now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout you're the best this film is more bizarre than something ed wood could have ever dreamt up if you are a fan of classic cinema crap seek this baby out
<START> salvage is the worst so called horror film i've ever seen there is nothing remotely horrific about it it doesn't deserve to be in a genre so fine first of all i don't see how so many people can think this piece of crap such a great movie if i wrote something as boring and utterly ridiculous as this i would be laughed at and too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it second the acting is terrible and the lead actress is excruciatingly ugly third the story sucks its been used before and the excuse that its a cheap movie is no excuse read the summery on the back of the case it reveals the whole story i do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste on something that will leave you regretting that you watched it i feel really bad for those crooks and the irony of their name all hail anthony perkins
<START> of the three titles from jess franco to find their way onto the official dpp video nasty list devil hunter bloody moon and women behind bars this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore a gratuitous rape scene and loads of nudity br br gorgeous blonde ursula buchfellner plays movie star laura crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the 'devil god' that lurks in the jungle a big naked bulging eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices br br employed by laura's agent to deliver a 6million ransom brave mercenary peter weston al cliver and his vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double cross during the confusion laura escapes into the jungle but runs straight into the arms of the island's natives who offer her up to their god br br franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks crap gore murky cinematography rapid zooms numerous crotch shots out of focus imagery awful sound effects and ham fisted editing the result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish it took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing and even the sight of the luscious buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain't enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry
<START> this is the first movie i've seen of john singleton and he is a pretty good director the movie starts out with a bunch of incoming freshman and it shows what happens to several of them omar epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship and having a hard time keeping up with his work he is friends with ice cube and beings dating tyra banks kristy swanson is a rich girl who is date raped and becomes friends with jennifer connelly who is a lesbian and isn't sure about which way to go michael rapaport is a kid from idaho who falls in with a group of neo nazis and their leader is cole hauser those are the three main characters and laurence fishburne is a political science professor who tries to help them it's a great film and it's unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts to the movie
<START> i grew up on this movie and i can remember when my brother and i used to play in the backyard and pretend we were in care a lot now after so many years have passed i get to watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it if you are parent and you have not watched this movie with your children then you should just so you hold them in your arms and watch them get thrilled over the care bears and care a lot the songs especially forever young are very sweet and memorable parents i highly recommend this movie for all kids so they can learn how enjoyable caring for others can be when it comes down to all the trash that is on tv you can raise your children to have the right frame of mind about life with movies like these
<START> i had few problems with this film and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated true it is over three hours long but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly i don't think it is overrated at all i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent the film looks sumptuous with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack and kate winslet is lovely as rose david warner a great actor steals every scene he's in the story is very rich in detail and is hot on character development obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow the last hour is extremely riveting and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat when the titanic sank i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving the music score by james horner was lovely though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on the 1996 miniseries was good but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies overall i give titanic an 8 5 10 bethany cox
<START> somehow this movie manages to be invigorating bittersweet and heartwarming at the same time stars like tony shalhoub from providence bring the tale to life the story itself is inspiring we see a desperate up and down life through the most innocent eyes imaginable a bird's br br paulie begins his life as a baby parrot given to a little girl played by hallie eisenberg also known as the pepsi girl with a speech impediment while she learns to speak correctly so does paulie however unlike most birds he can speak and understand everything being said the military father doesn't like the bird so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an aging artist ivy she teaches him manners etc while traveling across the country to find paulie's owner the movie continues with several twists of fate until paulie ends up at a laboratory where he is eventually hidden away in a basement and found by a russian custodian who is touched by the bird's story the plot is in keeping with the simple metaphorical theme that language is a gift and a curse i would like to say that the soundtrack is astounding a beautiful mixture of flute digital base and horns enhance the movie to the point of pure ecstasy the sweeping camera angles and breathtaking scenery beautify the story even more and as a final remark the puppetry is entirely believable unlike in star wars where yoda resembles a muppet this film is one of my favorite movies with the added remark that my wonderful parakeet of four years died recently overall i give this movie out of four stars two thumbs up and a big hug
<START> contrary to its title this film offers no spice and thus audience is subjected to a tasteless dish all humor appears forced theatrical mechanical staged reminiscent of those pakistani plays available on video including even the mannerisms everybody is screaming shouting and doing odd things for no reason the premise looks interesting as it is a straight lift from hollywood's 'boeing boeing john abraham who is so natural in almost all his films is a complete misfit here if we keep morality factor aside even then the bizarre events looks trite akshay kumar and paresh rawal two experienced stalwarts try hard to lift the film by being natural but in vain at least the characters of three girls should be made contrasting in order to bring some interesting elements but sadly here too all of them appears those brainless buxomed bimbettes 3bs who talk behave and even scream in quite similar fashion the major hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at his same home pretending that they will never get to know about each other just to do some sex what else the same could be done in hundreds of other ways therefore so much dramabaazi for no reason is not something audience will digest easily but surely great flesh show and tempting promos always gives such films a great initial now for those who call it a situational comedy i call it a pathetic taste sense of humor of such cinema going audience is surely gone corrupted and demented to the extent that they are connecting to a sadistic weird and maddening type of humor where it is not the characters that they laugh at but rather at themselves and at their own frustrations that look how senseless we have become that in order to laugh we have to bear with such things
