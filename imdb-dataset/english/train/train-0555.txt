<START> this was no trainspotting or guy ritchie film it was a big wannabee it wanted to be an edgy nervous laughter urban life affirming film but it's more of a camera jerky mess it's a lot easier to imitate something else than to create a real story with real characters from the beginning i couldn't care less about the characters or what they were involved in they were always always hitting pissing or crying on each other only there wasn't any substance to what they were doing the dialog between characters is meant to be hip revealing instead it comes out trite and one scene after another is predictable i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie so i could be wrong
<START> i am a massive fan of the book and orwell is certainly my favourite writer ever since studying animal farm at gcse i bought the dvd out of sheer curiosity burton is an actor i hold in high regard so when i heard that he played the role of o'brien i was swung br br i watched the trailer on the dvd first and some fears started to set in mostly regarding the frankly terrible theme song hearing the eurythmics mechanically shouting 1984 over and over again to an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds br br the acting on a whole is pretty good burton and hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the ministry of truth towards the end can be felt especially in the harrowing room 101 scene however this is also where the movie is let down the movie spends too much time focusing on the love affair between winston and julia which frankly isn't what orwell was writing about he was writing about a harrowing future about how ingsoc build up a mans beliefs and then shatter them all in the name of him being made to love big brother the movie skips over what is essentially the most important part of the book winstons coming to terms with his position in life and the world and his re education via o'brien br br the comment on imdb at the moment states that the movie sticks to the book is completely incorrect julia is not present when winston visits o'brien they do not commit themselves to goldstien's brotherhood and confess their crimes there is no obvious mention of the initial instances where winston finds the article with the unpersons but it does get mentioned near the end if you have not read the book it is completely confusing br br a terrible screenplay which some excellent acting cannot rescue michael radford seems to have completely missed the point orwell was trying to make and the electronica sound track is frankly terrible
<START> this is the sort of thing that only now thrills the film eggheads after all feierstein's flex crush will have you know that real men don't watch anything by truffaut br br it might have been interesting if truffaut had anything to say here the camera as voyeur motif was nothing new have we all forgotten de sica's bicycle thief or anything by hitchcock br br so all we get is the extended metaphor of the juvenile as truffaut who spends all his free time 'screwing up his eyes' at the movies who wrecks schoolroom discipline gets accused of plagiarism the many petty thefts and ultimately escapes societal confines to make 'his own movie' sorry been there done that too many times for this to matter
<START> a remarkable example of cinematic alchemy at work with a trite'n'turgid lump of lead script penned by numbingly mediocre hollywood hack nonpareil jole schumacher no less being magically converted into a choice chunk of exquisitely gleaming 24 carat musical drama gold thanks to brisk direction fresh engaging performances spot on production values a flavorsome recreation of 50's era new york an infectiously effervescent roll with the punches tone and a truly wondrous rhythm and blues score by the great curtis mayfield br br the story loosely based on the real life exploits of the supremes prosaically documents the arduous rags to riches climb of three bright eyed impoverished black teenage girl singers who desperately yearn to escape their ratty unrewarding ghetto plight and make it big in the razzle dazzle world of commercial r b music all the obvious pratfalls of instant wealth and success egos run destructively amok drugs corruption fighting to retain your integrity and so on are predictably paraded forth but luckily the uniformly excellent work evident in the film's other departments almost completely cancels out schumacher's flat uninspired plotting the first rate acting helps out a lot irene cara lonette mckee and dwan smith are sensationally sexy vibrant and appealing leads and great singers to boot comparably fine performances are also turned in by a charmingly boyish pre miami vice philip michael thomas as the group's patient gentlemanly manager dorian harewood as mckee's venal aggressively amorous hound dog boyfriend and perennial blaxploitation baddie tony hell up in harlem bucktown king as a dangerously seductive smooth operating stone cold nasty gangster the tone dips and dovetails from funny and poignant to melancholy and blithesome without ever skipping a beat deftly evolving into a glowing uplifting ode to the human spirit's extraordinary ability to effectively surmount extremely difficult and intimidating odds br br veteran editor sam o'stern acquits himself superbly in his directorial debut bruce surtees' luminescent cinematography and gordon scott's expert editing are both flawless o'stern's firm grasp of period atmosphere keen eye for tiny but telling little details and unerring sense of busy unbroken pace are just as impressive no fooling about curtis mayfield's impeccable soundtrack contributions either jump what can i do with this feeling givin' up take my hand precious lord lovin' you baby and look into your heart are all terrifically tuneful soulful almost unbelievably fantastic songs with the sweetly sultry love jones number something he can feel which was later covered by both aretha franklin and en vogue clearly copping top musical honors as the best ever song in the entire movie the net result of all these above cited outstanding attributes persuasively illustrates that sometimes it's not the screenplay so much as what's done with said script which in turn determines a film's overall sterling quality
<START> ronald colman gives a terrific performance as a stage actor who really gets into his work when he plays othello on the stage he takes on the persona with dire results good film with a great supporting cast well worth watching
<START> i saw this movie first on the berlin film festival and i had never seen hong kong cinema before i felt like sitting in a roller coaster the action was so quick and there wasn't one boring moment throughout the film it has martial arts love special effects and a fantastic plot my favorite scene is when the taoist drinks sings and fights for himself one of the many scenes which stress the extraordinary musical component of the movie this film is a definite must
<START> i have a six month old baby at home and time to time she fights sleep really bad one morning she was having a particular difficult time getting to sleep when the doodle bops theme song came on t v she stopped crying almost instantly and for the rest of the show was content i sat her in her bouncy seat and watched her kick her legs swing her arms and actually laugh at this show the kept her entertained and happy the entire time i also got a video of them so that at times when my little one is flustered i have something to calm her granted late at night if she awakes with colic to fuss the doodle bops are not her cup of tea but they sure do come in handy when i need a little time to do housework etc the biggest surprise about the doodle bops is that my child doesn't even like watching t v she'd rather be in the floor playing with a toy or with our small toy poodle than watch t v yet the doodle bops have totally captured her attention i don't know if she will continue to like them in the future but for now she's attached
<START> i thought what's new scooby doo was pretty bad yes i'm sorry to say i didn't like it since hanna barbera didn't produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series when i heard shaggy and scooby doo get a clue was in the works i thought it could be better but when i saw a pic of how scooby and shaggy were going to appear i knew this show was going to be bad if not worse i watched a few episodes and believe me it is just yet another teen titans or loonatics unleashed wannabe no longer are scooby and shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool creepy monsters that rob banks now they are going after a typical super villain whom wants to destroy the world shaggy and scooby doo have become more brave too also since shaggy is not going to be a vegetarian in this series casey kasem whom actually is a vegetarian the original voice of shaggy will not voice shaggy he will only voice shaggy if he doesn't eat meat and that was just a stupid corporate done change to update the franchise as if the internet jokes weren't enough so scott menville whom previously voiced red herring on a pup named scooby doo voices shaggy here believe me the voice is really bad it makes shaggy sound like a squeaky 10 year old and i must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look however kasem does voice shaggy's uncle albert which is a sort of good thing scooby doo on the other hand does not look that well he seems to have been designed to look more like the cgi scooby doo from the live action movies also scooby's frank welker voice need i mention brain the dog again still hasn't improved robi the robotic butler is practically worse than scrappy doo he tries to be funny and does comical impressions and gives safety tips remember kids don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm but it just doesn't fit into a scooby doo cartoon again the hanna barbera sound effects are rarely used here however on one episode lightning strikes twice they use the castle thunder thunderclaps during it almost extensively although they do still use the newly recorded thunder sound effects too scooby doo hasn't use castle thunder sound effects since 1991 but my question is why use castle thunder on shaggy and scooby doo get a clue while not use it on the direct to video movies or even on what's new scooby doo two episodes of wnsd used it and it wasn't enough unfortunately if wnsd and the dtv movies used it then they might be better than this crappy cartoon the day this show premiered i watched the first episode and it was so bad i turned it off after only five minutes to get my mind off of this poor show i rented scooby doo pirates ahoy which came out around the same time and you know what the pirates ahoy movie was actually better than shaggy and scooby doo get a clue and even better than what's new scooby doo and it looks like the new designs that the characters have isn't permanent to the franchise the direct to video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs thankfully but whether you loved or hated what's new scooby doo i don't recommend it but if you hate the old series then you'll love it oh god i hope the old scooby doo cartoon stay better than this new anyways like wnsd a really bad addition to the scooby canon
<START> hood of the living dead is about a young scientist named rick who lives with his brother in the town of oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets then one night rick's brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier desperate rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula they've been working on that brings sick blood cells to health the formula hasn't been tested on a human or even a dead body but rick is determined to bring his brother back to life he gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens so rick calls 911 and the body is carted away only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh now rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead hood of the living dead is one piece of trash the plot is a direct rip off of resident evil the acting is just horrible especially with rick' s fake crying for his brother the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out and the make up is just lame it's only fake blood covered over the actors face the zombies are also modified they run growl and must be shot in the heart to die zombies should only scuffle moan and must be shot in the brain to die this film is so horrible the outtakes is the only true good moment of this film hood of the living dead gets a 3 out of 10 a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest
<START> i saw this movie once a long time ago and i have no desire to ever see it again br br this movie is about preston waters a hard lucked preteen who always seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short on cash all this changes when a bank robber runs over preston's bike and passes him a blank check as compensation preston uses the check to withdraw 1 million from the bank ironically the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check preston then buys a mansion and says that he's working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy backer named mr macintosh named after his computer after that he just goes crazy with the money br br on paper this sounds like a great idea however on screen it is one of the emptiest movies i've ever seen for one thing it's too unbelievable i know some parts of the movie were meant to be incredible but i draw the line at a twelve year old boy going out with a thirty year old woman and being put in charge of a imaginary person's small fortune also this was a shallow movie with weak acting a predictable plot line and characters who are less than memorable the characters were either cheesy over the top annoying or underdeveloped but juice was a funny character br br if you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family skip this one
<START> twin brothers separated at birth due to the deaths of their parents reunite twenty five years later to avenge their parents and take back their million dollar tunnel double impact runs at two hours long and basically adds no real approach to the corsican brothers plot and jean claude van damme while adequate as the evil twin brother is just embarrassing as the good twin brother also the action sequences aren't as exciting this time and jean claude relies more on gunfire then on his martial arts also the supporting cast is wasted and at two hours the movie is just plain dull br br out of 4 bad
<START> i first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and i could not stop laughing everything about this movie seemed to click the storyline the characters the setting as far as film is concerned i wouldn't call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic it gets it's meaning across the cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie corben berbson fred gwynne ruben blades and ed o'neil are hilarious for this who haven't seen it i will give you a brief synopsis four criminals meet up in a small town in montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist however when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from new jersey they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose the film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of oceans eleven only with four criminals who can't stand each other and in montana rather than las vegas all in all if like to laugh i would strongly encourage you to see this movie
<START> columbo movies have been going downhill for years this year it may have reached the bottom peter falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes over as creepy in this movie as is usual in this series crime scene protocols are unheard of so plausibility is always lacking brenda vaccaro chews the scenery and pulls pantomime faces and andrew stephens is a pretty unconvincing lady's man his faint though was a hoot the script was by the numbers and its delivery patronising they should never have brought columbo into the nineties just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots better scripts and sharp characterisations
<START> perhaps being a former moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the 'arthouse festival crap' trashcan it's not the greatest film of 2005 nor is it complete garbage it just has a lot of problems i also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any 'ideological fears' or 'conservative taboos' or any other reason this movie might conversely be called 'courageous' and 'uncompromising' abroad it was banned because the censors knew 99 of the russian film goers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull film br br so we have a strong opening shot wonderful sound design excellent premise laden with meaning and symbolism the usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the film's strongest aspects not that the number 4 is a daunting visual challenge over the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup an amusing and well written bar conversation among the 3 main characters and we feel pathos for these people the great country of russia the human condition and all that then the movie starts slowing down we begin to wonder what yawn lies ahead br br the rest is quite boring simply put sure the guy in the village tugs the heartstrings and there are some slightly amusing moments nice sound sure but the enjoyment of this movie not to mention the plot are seriously compromised by the pacing problems and this this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the nicely shot abject misery and bleakness is what ultimately will make people angry at the 'offensive' stuff personally the main offensive scene bordered on being endearing in that pathetic way harmless drunks can appear br br if you want to watch an enjoyable movie where russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time the entire film watch particulars of the national hunt much more rewarding post soviet stuff so yeah a 4 out of 10 for 4 nice and symbolic of my post mediocre film condition
<START> i have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written the acting was not much more above the lower production values however i feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it in keeping with this thought i feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer i am referring to laura harris a canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the hbo hit dead like me where she plays the role of daisy adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner i remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader i felt as though if anyone might make it from this series it surely would be laura harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique nordic blond allure if you ever do have the opportunity to view this series i recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the 'godfather' or perhaps 'beaches' in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a low budget reminder of what laura harris can simply state about her time on the show and i bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying it's a start
<START> oscar caliber performance by peter falk in an oscar caliber written role i loved the nuanced balanced exploration of a long time marriage how often do we get that in films where usually the movie ends when boy girl get together this is a movie for adults a complex view through the eyes of all parties husband wife son how each have adapted to each other in the past and grow during the story on top of that it gave me about 10 major belly laughs and i'm one of those people who usually sits unamused when the rest of an audience is laughing this was one of the few truly funny movies i've seen great original jokes
<START> one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through killer tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage and pulp fiction designed primarily to offend apparently but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it
<START> i had to endure teen aged high school angst and family conflict for almost all of the show i really do not care about high school girls fretting about their relationships i've spent my time in hell dealing with such issues and i care nothing about fictional teenies going through lite versions of the horrors i endured i want science fiction that's the only reason i'm here there were a few seconds of science fiction late in the show we finally see a proto cylon it was good but with one problem its red eye dot would lock onto an object of interest we all know that cylon eyedots always scan back and forth giving the machine a map of the world the red eye dot does not ever stop moving back and forth br br i really hope the writers fix this abuse before the second episode
<START> i signed in just to comment on how awfully stupid this movie is besides being a rip off of executive decision or air force one or any other kind of terrorist story this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate seeing a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well it's hard to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid clichÃ© ridden script to work with it's bad enough if you groan once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence but when you find yourself groaning over and over again you have to conclude that the director also isn't the brightest bulb in the movie business nor are the producers for deciding to bring this story to the screen in the first place the mostly low rent actors you can excuse for taking on this assignment because they most likely showed up to get the money and exposure not that being a part of this joke of a movie is going to earn them any awards or recognition it may end up embarrassing them for having such poor judgment as to get involved in such a loser i see no point in summarizing the plot or even in giving any examples to prove my case for to do so would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could withstand just as studying well made movies can inspire you how to make a good skillfully put together work of art and beauty the only thing that you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what not to do and what does not work be warned
<START> this was far and away the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life it was slow boring not scary not funny not dramatic not entertaining br br sarah michelle gellar was up to her old playbook of empty expressions of fright and shock she couldn't sell her character nor could anyone else in the picture br br for those who thought the grudge was 'kind of alright' then don't go see this unless you get enjoyment out of wasting your time and your life br br i saw this movie for free by the way so i don't want this to come across as a rant from a guy that lost 8 bucks on a terrible movie it was free it still sucked i hated it br br avoid
