<START> neat premise very unrealistic what i learned from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all i loved how bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all unfortunately the same can't be said for his gal oh and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wreck br br lots of dragged out scenes including a plain stripper still have nightmares from that scene poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand i admit i was intrigued to see what the mysterious thing was behind the door but when it appeared i just laughed ha ha ha the girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived personally i really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like that
<START> this was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares for a horror or thriller film and hype it's way too tame there are only a few tense moments in here not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre even those tense scenes weren't much the music made them more dramatic that they actually were br br there is a lot of symbolism in here so the elitist critics label this a thinking person's horror film well if they think about it i'm sure they will come to the same conclusion i did a waste of money at the video rental store br br summary a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting vastly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised
<START> this movie pretty much sucked i'm in the army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible if your in the military and you see this movie you'll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad it was ridiculous they acted like a bunch of normal people with army uniforms on not knowing what to do it was a pretty gory movie i'd have to say the least there was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump i'd recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent gory movie it will be a better movie also if your not in the military i also would have to say i liked the first one better than this one
<START> absolutely fantastic br br now before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattÃ©s allow me to elaborate much as i enjoyed it this is quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen and is certainly the worst film i've seen at the cinema an impressive claim as i remember seeing daredevil on the big screen the two leads daniel gillies and elisha cuthbert were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst of course they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a daphne celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the oj defence the plot to stretch the term slightly was thin to non existent and the 'gore' scenes whilst undoubtedly brutal were irrelevant and laughably formulaic what plot there is revolves around a twenty something model cuthbert who is abducted imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures both psychological and physical the torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience whilst there really are very very few positives to draw from this film its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film i have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema within twenty minutes the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout for my part i came out flushed with laughter buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film making whichever way you look at it this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film br br p s i omitted to mention that i managed to get in to the film free so i can afford to laugh about it i was still tempted to ask for my money back it really was that bad
<START> six for the price of one so it is a bonanza time for cinegoers isn't it here it is not one not two but all six love stories an ensemble cast of top stars of bollywood plus all stories in the genre of your favorite top directors johar bhansali chopra et al you will get to see every damn type of love story that you enjoyed or rather tolerated for years now so no big deal for you do you need anything more than this no sir thank you why sir enough is enough please spare us they signed every top star that they manage to sign whether required or not so they end up making a circus of stars believe it or not too crowded every thing depicted here is exactly how it is prescribed in bollywood textbook of romances plus you have to justify the length given to each story as each has stars therefore it is too long three hours plus the gags are filmy characters are filmy problems barriers situations resolution Â yes you guessed it right againÂ filmy tried and tested same hundreds of dancers dancing in colorful costumes in background why they have no other work to do all couples are sugary sweet fairy tale type picture perfect all are good looking each story beginning in a perfect way and therefore should ends also in that impossible perfect manner too haphazard you can't connect to a single story here you have everything that you already seen a million times bloody fake unreal escapist abnormal stories considered normal for more than hundred years since evolution of this indian cinema what a mockery of sensibilities of today's audience yes it could have worked as a parody if he just paid tribute to love stories of yesteryear but alas even that thing is not explored at least director nikhil advani should have attempted one unconventional offbeat love story but then what will happen to the tradition of living up to the mark of commercial bollwood potboiler brigade oh somebody has to carry on no imagine on one hand audience finds it difficult to sit through one such love story and here we have six times the pain i mean six damn stories i mean double the fun of chopra's mohabbatein year 2000 in this age and time get something real guys we are now desperate to see some not so colorful people and not so bright stories oh what have you said just now come on that is entertainment my advice please don't waste your time henceforth reading such reviews go instead have some more such entertainment thank you
<START> although a tear jerker it is definitely a feel good movie all the actors were excellent and will smith as always does the job and does it well i could go on but pick any ten of the 10 ratings and they've said it as well and likely better than i could br br but since i must include at least 10 lines to post a comment i will say that rosario dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer her performance was most enjoyable and i look forward to seeing her perform in many films to come br br and this film demonstrates that will smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor
<START> pierce brosnan will probably be the only thing familiar in richard attenborough's new biopic the rest is new to international audiences canadian history and first nations culture br br grey owl is a light examination of how an man came to be adopted into the ojibway of northern ontario learning and preaching environmentalism decades before it became politically correct to do so the film contains a love story a moral message and a man tortured by his past that torture though is not always brought to life with the dramatic impact that it might br br nevertheless it is a film which holds its audience without any violence it pays deep respect to canada's first nations and presents them in a dignified and non stereotypical manner brosnan's performance is somewhat stiff but i suspect that's just how lord attenborough wanted him br br thanks from a proud canadian
<START> cq could have been good campy fun but it commits the only unforgivable sin it is b o r i n g the pace is deadly slow and the plot is fairly confused and so artificial that it's next to impossible to care where it's going the story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class from a thoughtful and sensitive eighth grader but this video should have carried a warning label caution student film fit for viewing only by relatives of the film maker
<START> this movie is the first time movie experience for several people in the cast all of them are experienced actors and have played in several tv series and plays sahan gokbakar is a well known comedian in turkey it's kind of strange to see him in a thriller while he is at the peak of his comedy career in turkey this movie is togan gokbakar's first long shot and pretty much the first experience as a director but they all did a good job we are happy to see such enthusiastic young cast they seem very promising for the future of the turkish film industry doga rutkay being long time sweetheart of sahan gokbakar is also a talented actress who is known for her recent play in number 27 theatrical play and several tv series
<START> it at all you have seen when harry met sally then avoid this one it will not only make you bang your head on the table as why can't bollywood even make a good remake but also annoy you with the so called funny moments in it the charm of the movie is missing ranee looks terrible saif tries to act like he is one hell of an actor the plots that have been picked up from the original don't look effective either the part where both of them bring their friends along and they hit a note it just doesn't look appealing what can be more disastrous you wanna waste some money this is what you can get otherwise put some more bucks and watch the original its too good to miss
<START> i don't understand the low 5 7 rating on this film it's a delight for people who like a strong suspense plot and dark atmospherics the tone is reminiscent of midnight in the garden of good and evil down to the locale savannah the acting is strong and i was amazed at the verisimilitude of kenneth branagh's southern accent famke jansen is great robert duval is effective in a small part and embeth davitz is the bomb great full nude scene of her too br br the plot is fairly standard but effectively executed
<START> i can't believe anyone thought there was anything original or interesting about this movie i'm a fan of science fiction as much as the next guy and i can enjoy even old movies with ridiculous premises as long when they are written by someone other than a monkey see for example my glowing review of altered states 1980 br br a monkey could have explained better exactly why i should for a second take seriously the basic idea behind this movie the problem is not that the producers had a low budget it's that they didn't care br br now to publicly humiliate the worthless magazines whose glowing reviews appear on the box br br chicago tribune br br san francisco chronicle br br san francisco bay guardian br br actually i enjoy reading the latter two still their movie reviewing credibility has gone through the floor but i know if i ever make a movie with handheld camera a cheesy plot and stupid effects i'll show it to these journalists and remind them what they said about conceiving ada
<START> a wrong doer is often a man that has left something undone not always he that has done something emperor marcus aurelius br br the dvd release of watch on the rhine could not come at a better moment it restores to us a major lillian hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by dashiell hammett hellman scholar bernard f dick's audio commentary affirms his authorship it presents a subtle performance by bette davis who took a subdued secondary role long after she'd become the workhorse queen at the warner bros lot equally significantly it reminds us that world war ii had a purpose br br sure you say like we needed that we've heard cary grant sermonizing in destination tokyo 1943 about japanese boys and their bushido knives we've watched jackboots stomp the living hills in the sound of music 1965 we've toured an england callously occupied by germany in it happened here 1966 yet truth to tell we still need the message spread br br i have an 81 year old friend who curses franklin roosevelt regularly he feels that fdr connived the u s into a foreign fight we didn't need and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin he's encouraged in his demonizing of allied leaders and the trivializing of war two by patrick buchanan br br the political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that adolf hitler would have posed no further menace to poland europe or the world if only the third reich had been handed the free city of danzig in 1939 buchanan holds that if those selfish poles hadn't confronted the nazis drawing in foolishly meddling britain and giddily altruistic france no war would have engulfed the west he believes that without the rigors of total war no one in germany would have built gas chambers to provide a final solution to the jewish problem br br some commenters on this site feel that watch sags under the weight of stale propaganda maybe however neither my friend nor pat buchanan seem to have gotten the film's point some people hurt and kill to grab other people's land goods and liberty such people dominated the axis powers and enough didn't appear in their vocabulary br br paul lukas deserved the oscar he won he and bette davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors they give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines for actively facing down torturers and murderers bernard dick notes that hellman didn't care for lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical of course as a hungarian he had seen first hand bela kun's bloody dictatorship of the proletariat replace an outmoded empire and then topple to admiral horthy's right wing tyranny br br in a marvelous cameo role added to the play by hammett henry daniell sardonically depicts a wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves his phili von ramme would doubtless stand with field marshal rommel in 1944 during the plot of july 20th against hitler in april 1940 however he pragmatically abets the nazi cause although he insults herr blecher the butcher and scorns the rumanian aristocrat teck de brancovis for trying to peddle information on an underground leader br br teck a pauper and possible cuckold wishes cash and a visa to return to europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empire shattering great war and the greater world wide economic depression he has no political convictions no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow mercury theater graduate george coulouris lends this burnt out case's old world cynicism an edge of desperate menace br br lucille watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping man's hostess a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way but who doesn't adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls she and her pallid office bound son belong to the american version of von ramme's and de brancovis' privileged kind however this family hasn't seen ruin and never will they're moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it br br this mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward national socialism and fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit buchanan watch on the rhine has a manicured period look its dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets yet hellman and hammett's film has gut based power audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march
<START> this early sci fi masterwork by herbert george wells with music by arthur bliss is a powerful piece of film making adapted from wells' somewhat different work by the author it presents a look at the human future with the subject of periods of war as versus periods of 'peace' the structure is that after a contrasted pair of episodes of normalcy and gathering clouds of war the script allows the war to happen two families the cabells and the passworthys disagree about what may happen passworthy takes a hopeful view of civilization's automatic progress cabell is the thinker the doubter their city everytown obviously london becomes wrecked by a war featuring tanks a magnificent war march by bliss and the end of civilization the second portion finds people living in the wreckage of what had been the city under a boss played with bravura by ralph richardson whose woman lovely margaretta scott is as fascinating a dreamer as he is a concrete bound dictator type he is trying to rebuild old wwi airplanes so he can attack a nearby hill tribe to complete his petty kingdom a young scientist complains about having his work continually interrupted demands for planes etc everlastingly this is wells' comment on war versus progress the survivors are subject to a plague called the wandering sickness also enter a modern flying machine piloted by the cabell of the first section of the film now part of wings over the world an international scientists' coalition who are planning to end warfare forever this flight suited modernist has fascinating conversations with the boss and his woman their attraction being evident then boss sends up his aircraft against them the scientists come with huge numbers of planes and drop the gas of peace onto the ruins of everytown only the boss dies fighting too hard against the pacifying the film then shows ore being mined and by slow steps being made into the girders of a magnificent new futuristic city of towers in section three a future cabell argues with a future passworthy over the morality of human science passworthy wonders if they have a right to send men to the moon cabell champions man's right to advancement and the need to expand his horizons the son of passworthy and cabell's daughter are the astronauts being sent theotocopulos a religious minded luddite makes a fiery speech on a huge screen in the city's forum and leads an attack on the 'space gun' that is to fire the new rocket free of earth's gravity the climax of the plot is the firing of the space gun successfully the denouement and ending is a speech by cabell praising worth and science that is universally considered to be the most profound defense of the mind ever penned it is all the universe or nothing cabell tells passworthy which shall it be as cabell raymond massey gives perhaps his greatest screen performance he is thoughtful compassionate and reasonable a true scientist as the rabble rouser who wants to end the age of science cedric hardwicke is perfect and powerful edward chapman playing passworthy does admirably impersonating the voice of convention and fear the storyline is logical frequently beautiful and always interesting given the near extinction of mankind the idea of a civilization run by rebuilder scientists is rendered plausible and credible to the viewer this is a triumph for the director william cameron menzies for bliss and for all concerned listen to the dialogue with someone you love within its constructed limits this is a thinking man's drama debating two possible human futures progress or its reactionary opposite
<START> it was meant to be a parody on the lotr trilogy but this was one of the most awful movies i've ever seen bad acting bad screenplay bad everything this is my personal opinion i don't doubt any second that there are people who'll like this sense of humor but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as mel brooks or the zucker brothers i'm working in a movie theater and in dvd shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas at the movies it was a nice but no big at all success during the first two weeks but then when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good the movie dropped very fast in dvd sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore in the last ten years the two worst movies i've seen are the ring thing and torque i can't decide which one was worse but i'm happy that there a so many good movies so i don't have to think too much on this question
<START> first let me state that i do not believe in god if you want to use the word atheist fine but i don't like that word since it describes what i'm not not what i am but i hated this documentary the production values were damn near non existent the premise extremely shaky and whole thing seemed to be an exercise in brian flemming's insecurities br br the production values were terrible and brian flemming is clearly an amateurish director at best the narration sounded like he just narrated over the film all in one shot and he didn't practice at all there were way to many umms and pauses when he should have been talking in the movie animation was also pretty damn bad br br the whole idea that jesus is a mythical character is not taken seriously by historians and biblical scholars as i stated before i do not believe in god and i don't think that whether or not jesus was a real man says nothing about the existence of god my personal view jesus probably was a real man but he lived in a time where there were many massiah's look up apollonius of tiana and that the stories of his life and preaching were blown out of proportion the farther you got from his death according to the wikipedia article on the historicity of jesus and there's a good citation for this so it's garbage virtually all scholars in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that jesus was a jewish teacher from galilee who was regarded as a healer was baptized by john the baptist was accused of sedition against the roman empire and on the orders of roman governor pontius pilate was sentenced to death by crucifixion 1 i was left wondering at the end of the documentary if this was more about the director's insecurities than anything else i was left wondering if he was trying to convince himself more than anyone else the most telling example of this is the final interview he was with the religious school principal he's not even coy about it the way he bombards the teacher is unfair and while i agree with the director partially that teaching kids about hell fire is a bad thing the way that flemming confronted the principal was just awkward to watch flemming had a chance to perhaps get a good discussion going if he was more tactile with his interview instead he comes off aggressive with isn't it bad to teach kids this stuff the guy cuts the interview short and i mean what did he expect the principal to say oh yes i see it is i have seen the light this will now be a secular school it seems that flemming is getting revenge for what he feels was a wrong done to him in childhood this isn't about the documentary this is about flemming's insecurities and has nothing to do with the supposed topic of the documentary flemming shows what he's really doing here and that is the real downfall of this so called documentary
<START> this sleek sexy movie is a must see only upon multiple viewings can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film personally i enjoy the narrator for his intelligent no subject left untouched style of narration the introduction grips you right away and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film he provides wonderful insight into the world of the trainables and allows the audience to really 'connect' with internal horror this film exhibits the script itself holds the movie together wonderfully not only for kids but the elderly alike will gain a higher understanding of the trainables and the modern grasp that they have on the sexual experience ahead of its time and groundbreaking in cinematography it surely defines the word 'masterpiece'
<START> film noir is an overused expression when it comes to describing films every crime drama seems to be a noir but where the sidewalk ends really is a good example of what the genre is all about br br very briefly an overzealous detective andrews accidentally kills a no goodnik who works for the mobsters the killing is blamed on the father tom tully of a woman andrews meets and falls for tierney to save dad from old sparky andrews captures the rest of the mob and turns himself in br br the morally guilty cop is driven by impulses from the past his father was a thief who was killed trying to shoot his way out of jail but that doesn't excuse his actions after he accidentally offs the no goodnik in self defense he immediately goes to the phone to report the incident but he hesitates he's already in hot water with the department and this could finish his career then at just the wrong moment the phone rings it's andrews' partner and andrews tells him the suspect they're trailing isn't at home he hides the body and later disposes of it by slugging a watchman and dumping the body in the river br br what motivates a guy to do something so dumb okay his job was at risk but now he's committed multiple felonies at least i think they must be multiple i counted obstruction of justice assault disposing of a body without a permit littering first degree mopery and bearing false witness against his neighbor br br in the end we don't know whether to root for andrews or not the suspect didn't deserve to die true but it was after all an accident because andrews didn't know he was a war hero and had a silver plate in his head maybe it's that kind of ambiguity that made noir what it was among other things such as characteristic lighting if noir involved nothing more than black and white photography murder criminals mystery and suspicious women then we'd have to include all the charlie chan movies under that rubric br br andrews is pretty good he's a kind of mark macpherson from laura gone bitter he never laughs and rarely smiles even when seated across a restaurant table from gene tierney a situation likely to prompt smiles in many men he has no sense of humor at all his few wisecracks are put downs when he shoves a stoolie into a cab and the stoolie says careful i almost hit my head andrews' riposte is that's okay the cab's insured andrews could seem kind of wooden at times but this is a role that calls for stubborn and humorless determination and he handles it well his underplaying is perfect for the part little twitches or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states and i guess the director otto preminger stopped him from pronouncing bullet as boo let and police as poe lice never could make up my mind about gene tierney she does alright in the role of tom tully's daughter a model but she's like marilyn monroe in that you can't separate the adopted mannerisms from the real personality traits did tierney actually have such an innocent almost saintly persona when she answered the phone at home did her voice have the same sing along quality that it has on screen poor tierney went through some bad psychiatric stuff before there were any effective meds for bipolar disorder and andrews too nice guy though he appears to have been slipped into alcoholism before finally recovering and making public service announcements br br the dvd commentary by peter muller is unpretentious informed and sometimes amusing br br anyway this is a good film as well as a good example of film noir the good guys aren't all good although the bad guys are all bad maybe that ambiguity is what makes it an adult picture instead of a popcorn movie for the kiddies only one shot is fired on screen and nobody's head explodes sorry
<START> i'll admit i think uma thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and have made it a mission to see every movie she has been in unfortunately that includes the horrible films batman and robin the avengers and this one br br this has to rank as the worst movie i've ever seen yes it ranks even lower than the avengers everyone looks lost in it and it is incoherent beyond belief br br even if you think uma is a goddess like i do please please don't subject yourself to this movie you'll hate yourself the following morning for it
<START> when paris is burning came out i totally dismissed it i was not into the whole madonna and vogueing phenomenon i thought it was going to be campy and silly how wrong i was about this movie i watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and i ran out and bought it it took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement i felt as though i knew all of the characters personally the 80s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of the gay culture what a terrific job i went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but i have not been able to locate all of them if any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know br br i hope they make another documentary i loved it
