<START> this movie is one reason imdb should allow a vote of 0 10 the acting is awful even what some here have lauded the carpathia character the script looks like it was written in haste in one scene the black preacher who was left behind when asked by buck what dan7 in the computer graphic meant said daniel 7 chapter 24 he probably meant verse 24 but the film makers missed this slip up perhaps the worst part is that the film's eschatological position is biblically unsound while many christians have espoused the film's interpretation of end time events such interpretation in my opinion is faulty to understand these flaws read christians will go through the tribulation by jim mckeever and the blessed hope a biblical study of the second advent and the rapture by george e ladd
<START> the movie macarthur begins and ends at gen douglas macarthur's gregory peck alma mata the us military academy of west point on the hudson we see a frail 82 year old gen macarthur give the commencement speech to the graduating class of 1962 about what an honor it is to serve their country the film then goes into an almost two hour long flashback on gen macarthur's brilliant as well as controversial career that starts in the darkest hours of wwii on the besieged island of corregidor in the philippines in the early spring of 1942 br br told to leave he island for australia before the japanese military invade it gen macarthur for the very first time in his military career almost disobeys a direct order from his superior us president franklin d roosevelt dan o'herlihy feeling that he'll be deserting his men at their greatest hour of need macarthur reluctantly together with his wife and young son did what he was told only to have it haunt him for the reminder of the war it was that reason his escape under fire from death or captivity by the japanese that drove gen macarthur to use all his influence to get fdr two years later to launch a major invasion of the philippians instead of the island of formosa to back up his promise to both the philippine people as well as the thousands of us pows left behind that he'll return and return with the might of the us army navy to back up his pledge br br in the two years up until the invasion of the philippine islands gen macarther battered the japanese forces in the south pafific in a number of brilliantly conceived island hop battles that isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of japanese troops into surrender the general did that suffering far less us military losses then any other allied commander in the war in the pacific br br it was in 1950 51 in the korean war that gen macarthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat after outflanking the advancing north korean army in the brilliant and perfectly executed with the invading us marines suffering less then 100 casualties back door or left hook invasion of inchon gen macarther feeling invincible sent the us un forces under his command to the very border along the yalu river of communist red china told by his subordinates that he's facing the threat of a massive ground attack by communist chinese troops gen macarthur pressed on anyway until that attack did materialized cutting the us un forces to ribbons the unstoppable wave after wave of attacking red chinese troops forced the us un forces to retreat in the big bug out of 1950 with their very lives leaving all their equipment behind across the north korean border even abandoning the south korean capital city of seoul this turned out to be one of the biggest military disaster in us history with the us forces losing a record in the korean war 1 000 lives on the very first day nov 29 30 1950 of the communist chinese invasion br br shocked and humiliated in what he allowed due mostly to his own arrogance to happened macarthur went on the offensive not against the advancing communist chinese and noth koreans forces but his own commander and chief pres harry s truman ed flanders in him not having the spin or guts to do what has to be done launch a full scale invasion of communist china with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from overrunning the korean peninsula for pres truman who had taken just about enough garbage from gen macarthur in him running off his mouth in public in how he was mishandling the war in not going all out like macarthur wanted him to against the red chinese this was the last straw on april 11 1951 pres truman unceremoniously relived gen macarthur from his command as supreme commander of the us un forces in korea pres truman's brave but very unpopular decision also by not going along with macarthur's total war strategy prevented a third world war from breaking out with the soviet union communist china's ally who at the time like the us had the atomic bomb pres truman''s controversial decision to dump the very popular gen macarthur also cost him his re election in 1952 with his polls numbers so low in the mid 20's that he withdrew in march of that year from the us presidential campaign br br in was gen macarthur's misfortune to be around when the political and military climates in the world were changing in how to conduct future wars with the horrors of a nuclear war now in 1950 51 a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out like gen macarthur wanted to against the red chinese with it very possibly touching off a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only the us ussr red china but the entire world it was that important reality of future war that gen macarthur was never taught since the a and h bomb weren't yet invented in west point br br back to 1962 we can now see that gen macarthur after finishing his commencement speech at west point had become both an older and wiser soldier as well as since his retirement from the us military elder statesman in his feeling about war and the utter futility of it one thing that gen macarthur was taught at an early age from his civil war general dad douglas macarthur sr that stuck to him all his life was that to a soldier like himself war should be the very last not first resort in settling issues between nations in that it's the soldiers who have to fight and die in it it took a lifetime with the advent of the nuclear age for gen macarthur to finally realize just how right and wise his dad a congressional medal of honor winner like himself really was
<START> i had read an article about dan jansen's olympic and personal journey before seeing this movie i'm always intrigued by a story of hope and overcoming life altering events and this was no exception br br the background of the characters that is provided gives you a sense of the family's closeness and how they positively affected each others' lives i can't speak to the accuracy of specific details in this movie it is customary to take some creative license when organizing a script however the spirit of dan and his family is what matters here br br its a worthwhile movie of a story that should be told i felt empathy for the characters and cheered at the end
<START> the most interesting thing about miryang secret sunshine is the actors jeon do yeon as lee shin ae the main character is a woman with a young son whose husband has died in a tragic accident and who leaves seoul to live in miryang which was his home town with her young son jeon's face is very changeable she is girlish flirtatious elegant aged and sad desperate and joyous with it and terribly isolated by turns and it's all in her face the film also stars song kang ho as kim a man who meets her when her car breaks down coming into miryang who happens to run a garage in town and who follows her around all the time thereafter despite her apparent lack of interest in his attentions song is the biggest star in korea right now renowned for his work with park chan wook and bong joon ho sympathy for mr vengeance memories of murder and the host and yet here he plays a throwaway character almost a forgotten man but of course he makes him interesting and curiously appealing he is the essential ballast to keep jeon's character from floating away br br lee shin ae is a piano teacher she comes to the new town which is a neutral place a kind of poor man's seoul a town just like anywhere else as kim says just as he is in a way just like anyone else her little boy is sprightly as little boys are but plainly damaged and withdrawn at times too his father used to snore and when he misses him he lies awake pretending to snore he goes to school and shin ae meets parents and students and shopkeepers there is a sense of place in the film even though the place is in a sense anywhere people speak in the local dialect and everyone knows everything and shin ae's seoul origin is immediately noticed is life really harsher here away from the big city and its sophistication shin ae seems not to realize the danger she is in br br something terrible happens and shin ae doesn't necessarily deal with it in the best possible way but it happens and she must face the consequences but she can't she goes to pieces a perpetrator is caught but that's no consolation eventually she becomes so despairing she relents and goes to a born again christian meeting an acquaintance has been pressing her to attend she finds peace and release with this but when she decides not only to forgive the perpetrator but to go to the prison to tell him so that experience is full of ironies and it destroys her all over again she becomes embittered and desperate and she no longer finds solace in religion and it gets worse than that br br jeon do yeon gives her all in this extremely demanding and protean role lee chang dong may be a very good director if an actor of the stature of song kang ho expresses enormous admiration for him that is convincing according to scott foundas of la weekly lee's first three films green fish 1997 peppermint candy 2000 and oasis 2002 have marked him out as one of the leading figures of his country's recent cinematic renaissance but this is not as successful a film as those of other korean directors whose work i've seen such as yong sang soo bong joon ho and the prodigiously almost perversely gifted park chan wook it may indeed begin as foundas says as a kind of asiatic alice doesn't live here anymore and then abruptly and without warning turns into something of a thriller and some time after that a nearly bressonian study in human suffering but that progression not only seems random and indigestible the film sags and loses its momentum toward the end and then simply fizzles out with no sense of an ending there are also weaknesses in the action shin ae takes foolish chances with her son and makes bad choices all along if she is destined for madness like betty in jean jacques beineix's betty blue which might explain her peculiar and mistaken choices that isn't something that is properly developed this is an interesting film certainly a disturbing one but one that leaves one doubtful and dissatisfied after putting one through an emotional wringer br br an official selection of the new york film festival presented at lincoln center 2007Âan event that has done right by korean filmmakers in the recent past
<START> nina foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little gothic nail biter she accepts a position as secretary to a london society dowager played imperiously by dame may witty and her creepy son the effete and bothersome george macready before she knows it she awakens to find herself in a seaside manor she's never seen before where witty and macready are calling her marian and trying to convince the servants and the nearby townspeople that she's macready's mad wife of course this pair can only be planning dastardly deeds and even though we know julia has to eventually escape her trap director joseph lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of just how she'll manage it br br my name is julia ross has nothing stylistically to set it apart from any number of films that came out at the same time period but i was surprised by how well it held together despite its shoe string budget and b movie pedigree there are quite a few moments that just may have you on the edge of your seat and i found myself really rooting for julia as she caught on to the scheme underfoot and began to outsmart her captors in any other gothic thriller the heroine would have swooned screamed and dithered waiting for her hero to come and save her so i can't tell you how refreshing it was to have the heroine in this film use her brain and figure out how to save herself br br well done br br grade b
<START> i am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007's films if 2004 was the year of the biographies and 2005 was the year of the political films 2007 can be identified as a year featuring a wide plethora of morality tales films that portray test challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things although this identification is rather broad i think that there are a handful of films released this year such as 3 10 to yuma eastern promises american gangster no country for old men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or treachery before the devil knows you're dead is a deviously stylish morality tale and quite a dark bleak and depressing one at that and even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time the legendary sidney lumet who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this viciously rich crime thriller br br it's one of those films whose plots are so thick that one is very reluctant to go into details it is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold as there are twists and turns but the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film the true focus is as i mentioned the morality tale the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film in a plot structured like a combination between the filmographies of both the coen brothers namely blood simple and fargo and quentin tarantino we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly ridiculously wrong and reciprocates with full force and inevitable tragedy and to make it all the more interesting the film is told in a fragmented chronology that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time sizzling sharp thick and precariously depressing kelly masterson's screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded in particular because it is a debut screenplay br br but the film has much more going for it than just it's delectably sinister and quite depressing plot first and foremost the picture looks and feels outstandingly well sidney lumet has throughout his career consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time the film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great editing is top notch combining the sizzling drama thriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly and vivid dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style the film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by carter burwell br br the screenplay does its part and of course lumet does his part but at the film's dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances first and foremost there are the two leads leading the pack is philip seymour hoffman who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon newfound leading man status after his unnaturally fantastic oscar winning performance in capote his turn in this film is fascinating severely flawed broken manic hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out and not just his subtlety and wit at his side is ethan hawke who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater grander actors here he bounces off hoffman and complements him so incredibly well in all the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that it's watching actors and then there's albert finney such a supple opulent supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the tragically obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime i love how the dynamics between the three of them play out i love how hoffman is clearly the dominant brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that they're middle aged men and yet despite this it is clear how finney's father favours hawke's younger weaker brother also on the topic of the cast the two supporting female characters Â wives of the brothers Â also feature fantastic performances from amy ryan and marisa tomei whose looks just get better and better as the years go by br br this film isn't revolutionary these themes and this style have already been explored by the likes of the coen brothers and it's very easy to imagine them directing this film but for a film that treads familiar ground it simply excels lumet employs his own immense directorial talent and employs his unique and very subtle sense of irony and style to masterson's brilliantly vivid intense and morbidly depressing first time screenplay the lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from hoffman hawke and finney but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a lifetime achievement oscar much revered as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business sidney lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful resonant intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years
<START> this movie has some of the worst acting that i have ever seen some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor this nail trap catches these bad guys the rest of the movie degrades as you go i can't believe that this movie is not even in the bottom 100 movies of all time i also can't believe that there are sequels the next crap movie that i want to watch is r o t o r could r o t o r really be much worse than this br br
<START> 'major payne' is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines this film does not really have a lot to offer but it provides several hilarious moments that are well worth a watch don't expect it to be a memorable film however just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious and that's really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne again it is not a great film and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter
<START> i have never commented on a film before i watched this movie with my girlfriend last night i've read comments saying this movie stays with you it does it's been almost 24 hours and i am still completely affected this movie left me questioning my own self how can i possibly compare myself to a character such as ben who is totally selfless i loved this movie i love movies that keep me guessing and wondering until the end i feel two emotions predominantly happiness and sadness an amazing feel good movie and a very sad one too i so wanted ben and emily to be together but in the end they were forever if you haven't seen this movie get it and watch it just make sure you have no distractions you'll want to see every nuance in this picture one for my library
<START> strangely this version of open your eyes is more mature and more nuanced aided by hindsight crowe's screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than amenabar's original the spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first but there's no doubt that crowe has improved on it if just slightly notice that you have no idea what the lead did in open your eyes but you know almost everything about the lead in vanilla sky that's what i mean by more fleshed out
<START> which do you think the average person would know more less about iranian cinema or iranian football interestingly the two come to the forefront of controversial iranian filmmaker jafar panahi's latest film entitled 'offside' a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around one's right to do something or go somewhere and an individual's right to extend that courtesy if and when they'd like to the odd thing is you don't come away from offside having learnt about iranian football or too much about iranian cinema unless it's an education in panahi's controversial style but you do come away feeling enlightened that at least someone from iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like iran and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it br br i can remember the 2006 world cup i'm sure many people can it was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year a summer of world cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic needless to say i saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in spain '82 when it was thought west germany and austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of algeria br br anyone in britain that was watching the bbc's broadcast of the iran Â mexico game both nations' first of the tournament may remember that at the top of the show the bbc's football anchorman gary lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match it went something like 'we've seen giants germany england argentina and holland play but now we get to see mexico and iran battle it out' the emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore it's a shame because there are people and films like offside present them who are really willing to see iran play to the point where they risk their well being to achieve it and it's sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem 'inferior' when there are others who'd do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage br br when immediately thinking of the words 'iran' 'football' and 'world cup' my mind flies back to the france '98 game between said nation and america here is a film about a world cup game of sorts involving iran but where some or indeed most iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around iran's famous victory over the united states and what that meant to them director panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude you can imagine a heavy handed film detailing iran's 'victory' as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they 'defeat' a western power or 'enemy' at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in br br a couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are 2001 indian film 'lagaan' in which the indian peasants defeat the ruling british at cricket similalry 2005's 'the game of their lives' sees the americans defeat the english at a football match only this time in the 1950 world cup the differences between these films and offside are immense offside is looking at a situation behind a state's mentality and dares to explore an essence of feminism as the girls trying to see their beloved iran defeat bahrain and qualify for the world cup are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game the reasoning is to do with the foul language the men 'may' not will but 'may' use during the game the film presents iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a man's right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a woman's right to see the game all together Â it is no wonder panahi's film was itself banned in iran br br but panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match panahi pays special attention to the title of his film 'offside' which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an 'attacker' is 'caught' trying to gain an advantage in the field of play the parallels run with the womens' position in the film as these advancing supposedly without right individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team that being the state itself br br i think offside is one of the better films to come out of the middle east and surrounding gulf area that i've seen it's a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the imdb and thus the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo realist aura to it all the immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrong doers who dared to defy the state is wonderful i also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons i've mentioned shows a distinct level of callous either that or you work in the iranian government

<START> first of all i don't understand why some people find this movie so anti american sure there are moments when the u s are accused directly like at the segments of youssef chahine ken loach and to a certain extent mira nair but come on they aren't naive accusations instead they are based on real and documented facts and all the documents that the cia released about chile confirms this for example br br but returning to the film itself what i enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it we find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of september 11 and react differently to this with dignity or frustration we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness br br all these visions and others as powerful as these or even more make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of september 11th thus what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks and this may make some people infuriated but this is the world where we live and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies regardless of what presidents or priests may say us br br finally i think it's a shame that there isn't even a release date for this movie in the united states of america it's a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened and this movie could give some clues to them this film puts very clearly differently of what some people of this forum think that everything we do today will determine our future and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today
<START> if you're going to look after a child make sure they don't live anywhere near a graveyard especially if said kid has a habit of drawing gory pictures and disappears at night among the tombstones to see her 'friends' but our long haired heroine oblivious to all the signs shacks up with her family the nortons which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the cast's tendency to talk even when their lips aren't moving and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths but enough of that domestic animals are being sacrificed old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra won't shut up during any scene even the quiet ones oh and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones on br br in fact it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather smelt what they'd signed up for and gone awol yes i know it's hard to get into movies these days but this sort of starter point is not one on your cv you'd want if would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill laurel barnett and another almost equally as bad by the charisma free child actress rosalie cole the next dakota fanning she ain't the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax br br this involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on but back up a minute earlier on they were in the car and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it so do they stay where they are safe no of course not they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like she's having a nervous breakdown br br finally the film closes it doesn't end it just goes to a grinding halt the main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood as if nothing horrible had happened but my dear viewer something horrible has happened you have just sat through one of the most lamebrained boring horror films you're ever likely to see and lost 82 minutes of your life you'll never get back just think years from now on your deathbed what you'd trade an hour and 22 minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family sadly it's already too late for me don't you make the same mistake 2 10
<START> just okay horror film about a nice suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and the thing in the basement that they keep feeding people they pick up off the street of course there is more to it then that but to say more would be telling br br for me this just didn't come together as it tries to have it two ways both as a family drama and a horror film the film tries very hard to walk the cutting edge between the two genres but seems more to stumble all over the place as it tries to be shocking something it never really is it doesn't help that the final revelation is less a scare then an oh as on oh thats it maybe if i hadn't been watching so many horror films recently this might have been better or it may have just seemed it since i wouldn't have compared it to so much br br i'd take a pass

<START> this was an awful movie not for the subject matter but for the delivery i went with my girlfriend at the time when the movie came out expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression what we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression with no uplift at the end the previews and ads made no mention of this plus for all that they played up whoopi goldberg my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes again the previews say nothing about this not that you would expect that but it's just more of the problem if i had known how depressing this movie would be i would've never have seen it or at least i would've been prepared for it this was a bait and switch ad campaign and i will never see this movie again

<START> on the back burner for years so it was reported this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly and went straight downhill from there mary richards mary tyler moore and her best friend rhoda morgenstern valerie harper meet in new york after a long estrangement and catch up on each other's lives what a novel concept but sad to relate nothing worth talking about let alone making a movie about has happened to either of them in the intervening years so instead the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another most having to do with older women in the workplace while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner the supporting cast is instantly forgettable the humor is nonexistent and the chemistry which moore and harper once had together is gone moore allegedly stalled this project for years waiting for just the right script before committing herself if this was the one she considered right what on earth were the ones she turned down like it's not the age of the characters that does this in for time inevitably marches on but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work at one time this was intended as a pilot but all to obviously it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors or for that matter among potential audiences quickly and mercifully forgotten the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic
<START> we start all of our reviews with the following information my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years recently we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost so we can see whatever we want whenever we want the point of this is that critics count for zero your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not therefore it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us we never ever listen or read the critics we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us well enough about that br br this movie is very good not just good but very good the critics are a bunch of morons just because there is nudity and language they hated it it was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for is that not right every movie cannot be an academy award nominee sharon stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want
