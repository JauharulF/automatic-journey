<START> i knew about but had never seen grey gardens before i saw the broadway musical of the same name friends cautioned me that if i had not seen the movie the musical would not make sense it did but it also prompted me to rent the movie at first i thought it was a train wreck full of strange shrieking characters and it was exceedingly hard to watch but being able to stop it digest it and go back to it made me realize why grey gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary br br both big edie and little edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self consciousness is worth witnessing both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age they have a relationship that will chill any woman and undoubtedly some men and make you re examine your own dealings with your mother in an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace it's fascinating to see the mayleses' work from three decades ago and realize what an impact the film must have had br br i echo what other posters have said how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family but beyond that how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped i would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track which gave me additional insight into the film
<START> after watching this i thought to myself there are either too few good writers directors or lots of producers br br at any rate this is a terrible movie terrible in a way that it's not fun but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver makes you shout this is wrong at the movie immersion is zero by now most of you are probably used to the terrible errors weirdness es in movies that has computers hackers etc in them this movie is like that in every aspect br br the only good thing about the movie is the little girl emily brilliantly played by eliza bennett i hope she becomes big and make this thing at least worth something br br do yourself a favor don't watch this there is not even proper action in it total waste of time
<START> i think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci fi flick for one thing it was directed by tim burton another thing it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic i found it boring gross and ridiculous if you've seen it you know what i mean just about everyone at imdb say it's crap and boy are they right if you haven't avoid it it's a snorer 1 out of 10
<START> wow this was a very bad movie as read in other comments this movie has no plot no character development they possibly had some kind of script but it's difficult to tell based on the actual end result br br the editing of this movie was really non existent it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is actually happening br br all in all this is simply a low budget zombie flick that was not thought out at all has bad acting bad dialogue bad everything br br the only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor i think this must be where they spent whatever money they had to try to justify making this br br unless you are like me dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find do not watch this period
<START> mmm doesn't a big stack of pancakes sound good maple syrup and fruit preserves on top take a bite mmmmmmm take another bite another another eat eat it you keep shoveling it down your throat until your face turns green with nausea you have just had the ally mcbeal experience br br i stumbled on this show in the winter of '98 and was instantly hooked like that stack of pancakes i gorged myself on it but the enjoyment soon wore off because the ally mcbeal character whom we see to be cute endearing at first sight soon becomes the most annoying insecure whining complainer you've ever met call me a feminist but i prefer my female leads to have a spine the gags gimmicks of the show also become hackneyed the music of vonda shepherd which is really shoved in your face becomes grating and the incessant character changes rewrites make the show into a damn soap opera br br my advice to you is to take this show in small doses and quit as soon as it becomes bothersome and it will i made it through 2 5 seasons before my enjoyment had totally soured it was good while it lasted but like a crazy neurotic ex girlfriend it just turned ugly after it had overstayed its welcome br br and next time you go to ihop skip the pancakes order something healthy like the fruit cup it'll sit with you much better
<START> this must have been an embarrassment to every member of the entirely african american cast every derogatory disparaging stereotype of the black american community is featured prominently i won't reinforce the insults by listing them here except to mention chickens watermelons and dice br br one good song by ethel waters and a couple of bad ones and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of 8 year old sammy davis bring the total up to something below 1 on the imdb scale
<START> like ishtar and king of comedy other great misunderstood comedies envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially losers may be too harsh a word i will call them suburban under achievers br br this film was a dark comedy gem and i'm not sure what people expect i relish seeing a major studio comedy that isn't filled with obvious humor and i believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile the look on stiller's face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way there were a lot of great scenes the j man's decrepit cabin by the lake corky's unceremonious burial weitz's wife role and walken's j man all great stuff br br i can't stand people that get on imdb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one i will take envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year save napoleon dynamite it's wittier wackier and an offbeat enjoyable gem br br remember this people most times popular doesn't equal good
<START> i was delighted to finally see the release of amazing stories the first season on dvd i had forgotten just what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series for the longest time the only way you got to see this remarkable series was with the vhs 2 or 3 episode collections or when sci fi would re run the episodes however when sci fi would host the re runs they generally stuck to the same episodes there were a few outstanding episodes in season one like the mission that they didn't repeat does anyone know exactly how long this series ran it says 1985 to 1987 at the top here at imdb but i thought it ran longer than two years if you loved the twilight zone night gallery and outer limits you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase
<START> this fanciful horror flick has vincent price playing a mad magician that realizes his vocational talents have been sold to another he devise ways of avenging all those that have wronged him his master scheme seems to back fire on him br br price is a little below par compared to his masterpieces but is still the only reason to watch this thriller supporting cast includes patrick o'neal mary murphy eva gabor and jay novello br br
<START> it all begins with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects in a hostel for students on hickory road london concerned for her sister who is the housekeeper there miss lemon asks hercule poirot to look into the matter he agrees but soon the stakes get higher when a girl who had admitted that she was responsible for most not all of the thefts is found murdered br br hickory dickory dock is a solid brain exercise without being as mind numbingly complicated as one two buckle my shoe murder theft and diamond smuggling are the crimes involved and the final twist that ties everything together is revealed only in the last 2 minutes the characters are interesting particularly the psychology student colin mcnabb and the mysterious american girl sally finch inspector japp has his funny moments in perhaps the closest this series has come to toilet humor and miss lemon gets a more integral part to the story than usual
<START> this is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life the pacing the camera work the emotion the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see it isn't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted the only flaw i can see about this film is that it wasn't captured in a more technically perfect film format it deserved todd ao technicolor and the very finest sound format available an intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter the gorgeous italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard as it is it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film i can't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite the transformations of the characters from contained tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and i really should recommend it more often br br the casting is perfect the mood is perfect the acting is above reproach it is a film about middle age and the choices people make it is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you if you don't get it perhaps you haven't lived enough or something else is wrong with you
<START> after chaplin made one of his best films dough dynamite he made one of his worst gentlemen of nerve during this first year in films chaplin made about a third of all his films many of them were experimental in terms of ad libbing editing gags location shooting etc this one takes place at a racetrack where chaplin and his friend try to get in without paying mabel normand is there with her friend also and chaplin manages to rid himself of both his and mabel's friends he then woos mabel in the grandstand with no apparent repercussions from his behavior lots of slapstick in here but there is very little else to recommend this film for other then watching chaplin develop the print i saw was badly deteriorated which may have affected its enjoyment charley chase can be glimpsed of 4 stars
<START> i guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story it's about two young girls who molest a grown man for 48hrs i don't see where the terror comes into play here there are some weird' and surreal sequences in the movie and the two girls sandra locke and ah oh well play the roll of two psycho man haters to the hilt they do a pretty good job although some of it is just a tad over the top the movie's not good and it's not horrible it's just really really dated i mean this thing is dripping with the 70's it's not really bad if you like that sort of thing you know that thang
<START> excellent political thriller played much quieter and slower than other higher ranking films in this genre when people talk about pacino and cusack how do they manage to skip over these amazing career topping performances a story of friendships father son relationships corruption and deceit the two actors gel amazingly well together and the supports from aiello and fonda are equally as impressive although aiello is brilliant especially when the papers run to press instead of focussing on an over complex corruption scandal it creates wonderful characters who show the human side of failure an political bribery the final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and acted
<START> pyare mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst ever films made by mankind the film one of the many handicapped people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of black is makes a mockery of the handicapped fraternity vivek oberoi and fardeen khan are mere caricatures of handicapped people while black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world pyare mohan shows two desperado like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests anu malik's music is fair enough vivek oberoi who made a promising start with saathiya is sadly losing his balls quickly in hindi cinema fardeen khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry amrita rao and esha deol are just pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in thialnd with no one to save them except for the afore mentioned desperados boman irani as the villainous don toni is somewhat acceptable avoid the film if possible
<START> only one thing could have redeemed this sketch a healthy gunfight between the happy couple the exotic model at the delicatessen and the old timer from the motel who was it would have turned out secretly watching from the woods and had been aging rent boy to the guys when they'd shared the rubber house br br in the process they could have blown that freezing shack to smithereens resolved most of the snags such as the whore bitch ode on the windscreen the reason why the protagonist had no friends as well as explaining his coolness under pressure from bloody tampon incessant phone calls and that crawl space chic the green thumb and his attraction to the simpler life quite the technician with the human body though ex abortionist morgue attendant a bit of a heartbeat would have been nice br br it was fun watching these people move around i guess but eleanora's silly italian games were suffocatingly stereotypical while the caretaker had been to too many yoga classes a dick a mind and a pick up truck about summed it up for him i also wished they could have had a bit more luggage eleanora is ready to go after putting some black underwear into her nifty red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a cardboard carton there at the motel br br trifling matters you may well say i agree although the niggling bits just didn't add up right in this rush job good owl wrangling though and i really felt cold all the way through
<START> ok i bought this film from woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it br br but we decided it to watch it anyway just for hilarity purposes br br and i'm sorry but this has got to be one of the worst films in history br br it began off alright and we thought ok this might actually be ok but after about 10 minutes we were sadly mistaken br br it began when the mysterious paint baller turned out to be the most obvious character the scouser australian i say that because he had an accent which couldn't be identified who's acting might i just say was abysmal br br then it got to the end and by that time we had all lost the will to live the paint ball finals br br the only thing i did like about this plot is that they didn't actually win but annoyingly enough they won by default br br and i know this has nothing to do with it but the name the team were given was just awful critical damage i mean they could of picked a more awesome name like the destroyers of the anti christ or something or that's what the film should of been called anyway
<START> the invaders is a fast moving sci fi thriller starring ben cross and sean young ben plays renn a traveller from another galaxy trying to find annie played by sean who is physically ideal to have his child this child if allowed to be born and returned to his planet may be the only chance for his race to survive the enemy an alien who has destroyed renn's people has also followed renn across the stars to stop this birth cross again shows great range from comical beginnings as the alien enters a local bar and orders his first earthling cocktail to his race with the enemy and the drama of whether he can keep annie and the child she is carrying alive
<START> in an interview david duchovny said he hasn't been able to watch even the first hour of this film and neither should you the scene where he asks the owner of a house where a murder was committed if he can look around change the name he gives and he could had lifted his performance from just about any episode of the x files he's on autopilot for the whole film brad pitt overacts appallingly
<START> not sure why it doesn't play in peoria apparently but this is a very funny clever british comedy it's set at the end of the swinging sixties peter sellars is fantastic as the rich forty something serial womaniser the perfectly delectable goldie hawn playing a 19 year american girl in london is initially sellars' catch of the day but the urbane tv food critic can't stop himself from falling for the dizzy american blond br br humour pathos great script strong performances from the leads and supporting caste br br it's a great film and the best gag is the very last line br br try it you'll like it
