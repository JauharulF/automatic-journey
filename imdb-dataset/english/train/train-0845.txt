<START> after reading several comments i felt i had to add in my two cents as well sorrow lost is one of the most memorable shorts i think i have ever seen i had gotten the chance to see this at the new york independent film festival i felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional the story was beautifully complex especially for such a short amount of time the story is focused on a young girl who is victimized by her abusive father she is soon given the choice to stop him by a demon played by witchblade's eric etebari having watched the show i was amazingly impressed with how he played such unique and different character i never knew he could act so well his character was deeply complex and he was very persuasive the acting was absolutely superb by him the girl's was okay and the father's was decent there is also death in this who follows the girl around until she is able to escape from her future the effects and cinematography were absolutely mind blowing i wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this it is rare you get to see such a high quality short the opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable with any major feature film this isn't to say that it's not without its flaws i thought it took a little to get going and the intro was a little long but this stuck in my head days after watching it there are very few shorts with this level of quality
<START> this movie is not for the faint or weak of heart it couldn't decide if it was going to be porn or legit it was neither one it was just bad there was nothing in this movie to make me want to see anything else made by these people again
<START> i simply give this a three because it fulfilled what my buddies and i hoped it would do entertain br br i wasn't stupid enough to rent this thinking it would be a zombie film up there with the likes of romero or fulci but what i rented it for was a laugh br br if you are looking for a film for amusement or a film to make you shake your head in embarrassment go for it this is perfect for junior mystery science theater fans but the only downside is that it is so bad it makes fun of itself br br i personally think it is a shame to relate this to any other hollywood title that we may know because when a film sucks like this it has its own genre
<START> mindless dribble about the second coming of christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking sandra locke you have no idea what's happening on the screen with the irritating theme song suzanne being played over and over throughout the movie until when the second coming of suzanne is over you already know it by hard no matter how hard you try to forget the whole thing br br this off the wall armature movie maker logan jared martin is out to make the movie of the century but is so rude and obnoxious that none in the banking world is willing to finance his project planning to go on his own logan then spots this couple at a seaside cafÃ© and is fascinated with the young woman suzanne sandra locke who reminds him of someone he knew in another life jesus christ br br with logan's assistant and all around gofer clavius richard dreyfuss somehow getting a 740 000 00 loan from the bank to finance logan's masterpiece he starts to work on suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress in order to get her interested to be in his film this leads to suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist simon paul sand but later simon being so depressed and feeling all alone takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brains out br br the movie also has two somewhat unrelated sub plots in it that has to do with a young autistic girl dorothy kari avalos who's cured of her autism by suzanne after everyone else at the psychiatric hospital that she was committed to failed it's not really known what exactly suzanne was doing at the hospital but she seemed to be some kind of orderly or volunteer there was this supposed to show us in the audience that she like jesus could miraculously heal the sick br br there's also this newspaper columnist and big time businessman tycoon jackson sinclair gene barry who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid life crisis or has seen a biblical like vision that changed his life forever sinclair had been searching for the meaning of life as well as what it's all about all through the movie and wanted to know why there's all this suffering in the world like this movie that he's in and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid his eyes on suzanne sinclair also got some sense knocked into his head when his private chauffeur david mark rasmusser who's gotten sick and tired of his weird and crazy hallucinations almost running him off a cliff in a kamikaze like drive along the pacific coast br br the movie the second coming of suzanne goes on with a number of unrelated sequences probably to fill or pad in some time by it's director and film editor and then goes to it's final scene in a christ like crucification on a hill as logan has all the cameras rolling it turns out that the crazed logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to replicate on the helpless and tied up suzanne the actual crucification of jesus christ some 2 000 years ago br br hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow the second coming of suzanne puts you through the same kind torture that suzanne is put through by logan and the makers of the film the movie tries to be arty but that's just an excuse to cover up it's brainless and non existent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it
<START> a great idea 11 stories about 11 september 11 directors from different countries with different results ken loach talking about an immigrant as usual is just brilliant as usual the frenchman does a very good job also while the burkina faso film was a nice surprise however the israel film was a bit boring and the mexican guy well he should quit directing and work in a mexican restaurant 8 10
<START> i suppose all the inside jokes is what made munchies a cult classic i thought it was awful though given the ridiculous story and the nature of the characters it probably could've been a much better and funnier movie maybe all they needed was a real budget br br munchies as many viewers have pointed out already is something of a gremlins parody hence all the references to the movie the movie begins somewhere in peru during an archeological dig an annoying dufus named paul aspiring stand up comedian who offers no sarcasm or witty jokes during the movie despite his career plans is holed up with his dad in the caves his dad is an unconventional kind of archeologist searching the caves not for artificats or mummies or anything but proof of u f o 's and that's where the munchies come into the picture hidden in the crevice of a rock is an ugly little mutant that looks like a gyrating rubber doll with a gizmo voice they name him arnold stash him in a bag and bring him home so paul's dad can finally show proof of extra terrestrial life br br paul the idiot that he is breaks his promise to his dad to watch arnold a wager he made with his dad if he loses it's off to community college to get a 'real' career the creepy next door neighbor with the bad rug cecil television veteran harvey korman wonders what his neighbors are up to so he and his lazy son some airhead hippie type who looks more like they should've made his character a biker or heavy metal enthusiast to go and snatch arnold why a get rich quick scheme of course and of course even cecil's son is too dumb to look after arnold and after a few pokes and prods at arnold he multiplies into more munchies br br this wasn't even a movie that was so bad it was good it was just plain awful i was hoping that the munchies would've mutated and killed the morons that were always after them even paul and his girlfriend at least it would be one way to get rid of all the bad acting in this movie that really hams up the movie not to mention poor special effects that look like hand puppets and really bad writing all around it wasn't even funny not even that young cop who can really give you the homicidal twitch in your eye like i said munchies if they had been given an actual budget and better actors they might've been able to pull off a good parody pass
<START> having decided some time ago to collect the films of billy bob thornton on the strength of class movies like sling blade a simple plan and the man who wasn't there amongst others it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there what i didn't realise however was that there could be one this bad i'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is the funniest dialogue in it goes like this knock knock who's there the big stinking man the big stinking man who the big stinking man is you yes folks it really is that bad billy bob is only in it for about two minutes i guess he needed the work at that time in his career and the rest of the movie is painful for some reason though although it's undeniably awful i don't hate it that's probably because i save my ire for any high budget special effects laden junk like the fast and the furious and not a no budget flick like this one 2 10 at a push
<START> this is definitely the worst bigfoot movie i've ever seen and quite possibly the overall worst movie i've ever seen in my life the actors and actresses were horrible and it seemed like they were trying way too hard to play their roles as dorks tough guys jerks know it alls etc and the bigfoot itself was terrible it appeared to be some kind of computer generated image from the days of atari intellivision at one point near the end of the movie as an army of sasquatches were chasing after the remaining survivors one gets shot and as it's running it looked like a poor man's version of donkey kong himself and one gets hit by a bullet and the blood that comes out of it was just awful animation another thing that was annoying was the music way way way too much music classical score or whatever you call it throughout the entire film it was never ending oh yeah the movie is boring too absolutely one of the worst films i've ever seen i highly recommend taking your 3 or whatever they charge to rent this movie and spending it on a gallon of gas or a value menu somewhere truly awful
<START> as someone else mentioned it begins with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat then the main story a photographer gaffari and a writer shepard meet by chance and take a trip into the mountains first they spend the night at an inn where the slightly deaf landlord gets hollered at with increasing irritation to the audience by gaffari once in the mountains they seek shelter again and are invited in by a kindly old lady who seems overly hospitable to strangers hansel and gretel anyone what happens next i will leave for the bold viewer to sort out because i most assuredly couldn't now i like eurohorror and this woulda been better if only artigot writer and director had made some attempt at logical story telling the backdrop pyrenees makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult occurrences the verdant peaks could easily obscure supernatural forces and those who command them the photography is nice just wish the whole thing made sense you can view this film at archive org
<START> david zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce yes it's a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of sophomoric gags but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts the film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame or you'll likely miss them like his previous efforts which include airplane top secret and naked gun the humor flies out almost every second there are so many moments that work it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat what sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line while others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies take mafia please this film tells a new story with likable characters it touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies even for people who don't care for south park its creators matt stone and trey parker make a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry the film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes sports announcers and other celebrities especially a hilarious bit with robert stack of unsolved mysteries by the way stay through the credits for a final joke with bob costas and al michaels all in all zucker has achieved in words perhaps applying to the movie's mix of sports a home dunk
<START> when you get your hands on a british film you expect some sort of quality and when it comes to acting camera work lighting etc this film does the business it's done by highly skilled craftsmen that alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours but when you look under the layers of professionalism you don't really find anything apart from making you feel good and advocate a drug liberal view there's really nothing there the script is mediocre the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst east of hollywood in all it's english cosiness it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another full monty why they made this film i haven't got a clue apart from making money of course
<START> i have seen this film on countless occasions and thoroughly enjoyed it each time this is mostly due to the lovely erika eleniak a great actress with incredible looks plus any film starring tom berenger and dennis hopper is bound to be entertaining
<START> i thought this movie was very well put together the voice overs were also great i liked how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals i would recommend this movie to anyone it was definitely worth the time and money to watch it atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh other scenes made me sad and others made me glad it is a movie any age can enjoy from the moment milo is the crazy profesor or until he gathers the crew up for the fantastic voyage under the sea after i watched the movie i read the book it was good as well but the movie puts better pictures in your mind it is just like the book but go ahead and watch this movie
<START> i'll admit i've only watched a handful of episodes but each one seemed completely different from the next it seems after the first season the producers decided to completely retool the show drop characters introduce new ones and rewrite the entire show dynamic br br as you have probably surmised already the show is about quirky unpredictable teenager holly amanda bynes who moves in with her high strung sister valerie jennie garth in new york city decent enough premise odd couple fish out of water high jinx br br while i miss the sitcoms of yore this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly and it's sad because they have some decent talent br br on top of everything they insisted on changing the show val was living with a cast regular bf one season then he was suddenly gone so she opens a bakery what when things change that drastically you get the feeling that even the show knows it's bad i mean completely new sets characters written off and new show regulars br br on a side note this is just nitpicking i know this is a television show and not real at all but val and holly end up living in a huge loft duplex there are stairs with a terrace in manhattan are you serious
<START> i am a big fan of the movie but not for the usual reasons i think travolta and winger performed at higher than average rates i think the sets were representative of the location and the era i liked the sound track and the charlie daniels band however i think the photography was amazing since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and gilley's had low ceilings perhaps 10 12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a smoke filled bar hung 2 4 feet below the ceiling the camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors the bull the bar the women the dancing the low level of light that actually was in the bar what a feat sure there was auxiliary lighting but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar it had to be low light shots ray villalobos the camera operator was outstanding he got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film thanks ray great work
<START> it's been a while since i've watched this movie and the series but now i'm refreshing my memory this was a very funny movie based on the classic series johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm bo and luke sneak around hogg's local construction site and find samples of coal they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip mine hazzard county unless the dukes can stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin daisy my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn't right for the part of boss hogg and sheriff rosco p coltrane was way too serious other than that i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard
<START> the story goes something like this a small town girl katie jessica simpson decides to visit her boyfriend in the big city when she arrives she discovers he isn't quite as faithful as he should be katie then ends up venturing into the adventure that is new york filling in as bike messenger comedic and charming mishaps ensues she falls into a hole in the ground and thus meets charismatic good guy ben luke wilson it's not love at first sight at least for her but destiny and ben won't give up quite that easy being just a small town girl and blonde a couple of evil executives at a building firm decides she's the perfect scapegoat for their cunning plan misunderstandings with hilarious and sad consequences follow however this is one blonde who won't take it lying down br br people being judgmental of this film will soon enough be proved wrong the jokes are confident and fitting and the story well developed the relationship between katie and ben feels so natural that it puts anything godard has created to shame the multi talented jessica simpson once again surprises with a strong role only she could pull off simpson really is the marilyn monroe of our day there's even one scene honoring her she balances perfectly between vulnerable and whimsy katie really does show us that you can't judge a book by its cover luke wilson is as charming as ever even if he was covered in manure that man would be as appealing as anyone his light touch puppy dog eyes and laid back manner makes it difficult to resist andy dick plays the role he was born to play one of the two diabolical executives he really cannot be underestimated the strength of the performance lies in his restraint it's remarkable because most actors would just run away with it and play it for cheap laughs not this guy br br in conclusion director scott marshall has crafted an intelligent and frequently hilarious comedy that is destined to become a classic alongside masterpieces of cinema like epic movie and norbit kudos to everyone involved in this especially jessica simpson her sincere smile and whole hearted laughter would make even the toughest man break out in a big grin you may be tough but you're not that tough warmly recommended to everyone who wants to be swept off their feet and see a romantic comedy that for once feels honest thank you for this film oh and the soundtrack rocks br br now if you still haven't gotten it i'm being sarcastic 1 10
<START> if you've ever wanted to see a film that stresses style over substance this is for you to me son de mar is beautiful to see but there's precious little substance unless mawkish melodramatic manipulative love yarns turn you on this may be one of those famous 'chick flicks' you've heard so much about br br we're about half way through this film before anything really happens ulises jordi molla goes out to sea looking for tuna and doesn't come back leaving his wife martina leonor watling and son to fend for themselves then in a furious six minutes of screen time they bury ulises martina gets married again and her son grows into mid childhood this rapid transposition is jarring to say the least and very sloppy after 40 minutes of more or less hanging around we're suddenly into a full blown melodrama all in six minutes i think this is called wayward narrative pacing br br five years later ulises as in the wandering superhero ulysses get it returns to his 'penelope' watling only to find she's married to sierra eduard fernandez an inexplicably wealthy guy what does he do to earn all that dough who inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets when martina in great anger questions ulises about his absence he tells her that he'll take her to the island of sumatra someday and she'll understand everything br br and here's the thing he doesn't take her to the island of sumatra the reference just dies somewhere in the script he doesn't really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and child for five years he doesn't acquit himself as an honourable guy and the movie doesn't fill in the plot holes that are staring at us for at least half of the film i can only assume that director bigas luna wants us to fill in the story lines with the mystical clues fish reptiles the sea he offers through breathtaking cinematography and evasive dialogue it just doesn't work the narrative 'arc' on this film ends up looking more like a wobbly clothesline br br i'm sure jordi molla is a good actor but i just couldn't buy his ulises as any kind of hero which is what the original ulysses was supposed to be with moist sensuality he spouts a short stanza of identical poetry from virgil roughly 2 000 times and each and every time it excites martina to explosive orgasm this guy should be rented out to reinvigorate stale marriages i'm sure virgil would be impressed he didn't get laid that often as i understand it br br this poetic 'device' figures prominently in the film and i had no choice but to assume it was a gender reversal of ulysses' famous 'siren song' i e beautiful maidens singing seductively to far off sailors who were doomed if they answered the well siren call if this is what bigas luna is up to you can see the problem he's offering convoluted symbolism in a snatch and grab attempt at high art once again it just doesn't work at least in my eyes br br watling is a beautiful and magnetic young actor but she gives us a character here who doesn't seem to have much intellectual or even romantic depth it's beyond me how she could desperately fall in love with a guy who sports a for rent sign on his face as in vacant oily 1960s style hair that looks more like seaweed and one of those trendy 21st century 'beards' you know four days' growth no more no less he's supposed to be a dreamy kind of guy i think but those eyes of his suggest he might be suffering more from overexposure to a preposterous script br br but don't despair this film is great to look at just don't try to connect the dots on the red herrings or think too much about what you're hearing in the way of dialogue you can do a lost of fast forwarding on this film particularly in the first 40 minutes and you really won't miss much
<START> from the start you know how this movie will end it's so full of clichÃ©s your typical nra member will not even like this movie i give it 2 out of 10 only because of the acting of william benton i can't believe people voted 6 for this movie it's so biased towards a 'certain point of view' once a thief people aren't born bad neither are they born good they are born with a clean slate it's society parents and education what makes them who they are and if they take the wrong turn somewhere down the line it certainly isn't going to be the american penal system that gets them back on track anyway avoid this movie like the plague i bet you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this piece of crap br br
<START> happy go lovely is a waste of everybody's time and talent including the audience the lightness of the old hat mistaken identity and faux scandal plot lines is eminently forgivable very few people watched these movies for their plots but they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots not here they usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs not happy go lovely and vera ellen as the female lead played the whole movie as a second banana looking desperately for a star to play off it and instead she was called upon to carry the movie and couldn't do it the scottish locale was wasted usually automatically ubiquitous droll scottish whimsy is absent the photography was pedestrian the musical numbers were pedestrian cesar romero gives his usual professional performance chewing up the scenery since no one else was doing his part in the type of producer role essayed frequently by walter abel and adolph menjou david niven is just fine and no one could do david niven like david niven at the end of the day if you adore niven as i do it's reason enough to waste 90 minutes on happy go lovely if not skip it
