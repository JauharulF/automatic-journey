<START> set in the cameroons in west africa in the 1950s claire denis' chocolat is a beautifully photographed and emotionally resonant tone poem that depicts the effects of a dying colonialism on a young family during the last years of french rule the theme is similar to the recent nowhere in africa though the films are vastly different in scope and emphasis the film is told from the perspective of an adult returning to her childhood home in a foreign country france dalens mireille perrier a young woman traveling through cameroon recalls her childhood when her father francois cluzet was a government official in the french cameroons and she had a loving friendship with the brooding manservant protÃ©e isaach de bankolÃ© the heart of the film however revolves around france's mother aimÃ©e giulia boschi and her love hate relationship with protÃ©e that is seething with unspoken sexual tension br br the household is divided into public and private spaces the white families rooms are private and off limits to all except protÃ©e who works in the house while the servants are forced to eat and shower outdoors exposing their naked bronze bodies to the white family's gazes it becomes clear when her husband marc franÃ§ois cluzet goes away on business that aimÃ©e and protÃ©e are sexually attracted to each other but the rules of society prevent it from being openly acknowledged in one telling sequence she invites him into her bedroom to help her put on her dress and the two stare at each other's image in the mirror with a defiant longing in their eyes knowing that any interaction is taboo br br the young france cecile ducasse also forms a bond with the manservant feeding him from her plate while he shows her how to eat crushed ants and carries her on his shoulders in walks beneath the nocturnal sky in spite of their bond the true nature of their master servant relationship is apparent when france commands protÃ©e to interrupt his conversation with a teacher and immediately take her home and when protÃ©e stands beside her at the dinner table waiting for her next command when a plane loses its propeller and is forced to land in the nearby mountains the crew and passengers must move into the compound until a replacement part can be located each visitor shows their disdain for the africans one a wealthy owner of a coffee plantation brings leftover food from the kitchen to his black mistress hiding in his room another luc jean claude adelin an arrogant white frenchman upsets the racial balance when he uses the outside shower eats with the servants and taunts aimÃ©e about her attraction to protÃ©e leading her to a final emotional confrontation with the manservant br br chocolat is loosely autobiographical adapted from the childhood memories of the director and is slowly paced and as mysterious as the brooding isolation of the land on which it is filmed denis makes her point about the effects of colonialism without preaching or romanticizing the characters there are no victims or oppressors no simplistic good guys protÃ©e is a servant but he is also a protector as when he stands guard over the bed where aimÃ©e and her daughter sleep to protect them from a rampaging hyena it is a sad fact that protÃ©e is treated as a boy and not as a man but bankolÃ© imbues his character with such dignity and stature that it lessens the pain because of its pace western audiences may have to work hard to fully appreciate the film and denis does not in roger ebert's phrase coach our emotions the truth of chocolat lies in the gestures and glances that touch the silent longing of our heart
<START> this movie is terrible but it has some good effects
<START> a superb and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious russian serial killer andrea chikatilo magnificent performance from stephen rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the russian government in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society br br the film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in russia which is subtly put across there is a conflict of old ways and new ways and these are represented by the two viewpoints of rea's superior played by donald sutherland and rea himself these are at first polarised with sutherland 'high' in system looking down and rea 'low' on the ground looking up however they have a common cause Â to catch the serial killer br br throughout the film the relationship between these two develops and the tension gradually eases until at the end of the movie rea and sutherland and rea and sutherland have mutual respect for each other the killer is caught and glasnost symbolically comes excellent script br br further credits go to sutherland's performance which is superb and sympathetic jeffrey demunn as the killer whom we despise but can't hate and max von sydow who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help
<START> boy what a dud this mess was but it only lasts an hour and i only paid a buck for it so i'll live unlike the entire cast of this 1933 clunker who are all dust by now br br so anyway a small village starts having bodies turning up that have been drained of all their blood the local yokels start talking about vampires of course and a little more loudly after each body is found the town sheriff or constable or whatever he is played by awesome actor melvyn douglas tries to tell them otherwise when he mentions the fact that the dead have one large hole on each side of the neck instead of two holes close together the locals simply then say it's a giant vampire bat the constable insists that vampires do not exist and it must be a human culprit doing the killings br br but melvyn doesn't seem too bothered either way he spends most of his time trying to get into the pantaloons of his sweetie played by faye wray also in this mix is the town simpleton played by dwight frye who always seemed to have played the same role in every movie he did he further freaks out the townspeople by catching bats and drinking his own blood lionel atwill plays the town doctor who seemingly is trying to help the constable solve the crimes and boy does he ever stink as an actor atwill is as close to cardboard in this role as he could get and lionel barrymore is also in this thing lots of big names to be such a pile of guano br br other than the terrible mis title this movie has the alternate name the blood sucker is much better this movie is also dull and plodding and just silly br br for me the high point of the movie is watching frye he nails the freaky town weirdo but other than him this movie didn't offer much and then when you find out the reason for the strange deaths and see the special effect thing that required all this blood you'll really be let down br br bela lugosi did a lot of awful pictures but at least he was fun and interesting to watch think of this movie as a really bad lugosi clunker without lugosi and you'll get a feel for how miserably bad this mess was br br if you can't make a good 1930's horror film at least put lugosi in it
<START> this is another of the many b minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it all aspects of the film script acting direction are mediocre the acting by the three leads is wooden i guess john dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing tv work lee j cobb who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction jane wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers the movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that i have ever seen the one in which john dall goes after lee j cobb is particularly strange the dvd transfer is typical alpha
<START> includes spoilers br br i've been a horror film fan now for many decades just when i think i've seen all the great ones another pops up to surprise me i had never seen this film before it was a treat off the beaten path too not just the path to the swamp ferry boat either here was a horror film made in the 1940s that dared to try something very different the pretty girl is gulp fearless for a change and saves the men including the man she loves from the monster how is that for a twist this girl was the complete opposite of most women in films of that time no screaming at her own shadow no fainting from fright no tripping over a leaf as she runs this gal wasn't afraid to live alone in a secluded hut far away from the rest of the villagers not only that but the place was on a foggy swamp rumored to be haunted heck she even takes naps on the swamp grass outdoors like a regular 1940s version of ripley no snake gator or ghostly strangler would dare bother this gal books on early feminist films should be sure to include this overlooked work br br see this if you are a fan like me of those wonderfully atmospheric classic b w horror films they made only in the 30s and 40s and be sure to wear your cast iron turtle neck for protection
<START> br br however the ladies of all ages will lap it up no doubt at least the opposite sex understand what it is to be a mother and most of us men try to fathom out what it is to be a father whether changing nappies is not at all my favourite occupation and trying to get those bottled baby foodstuffs into errant toothless mouths must rank very high on household duties preferably left to its mother has absolutely nothing to do with the matter br br some good interpretations here and a good story idea the handling of the matter limited to rather scanty tv production concepts gives the film a rather over mellowy taste with not much new to offer an insipid way of delivering the goods and in the end the outcome is so forseeable during the last 20 minutes or so even my wife dozed off and i was jumping up to the computer to get the on line scoring in the barcelona deportivo match hoping the away team would do something rather good they did this film did not br br better by far is mike leigh's magnificent secrets and lies qv which touches on the same subject matter but with brenda blethyn playing a far superior part
<START> by the numbers story of the kid prince a singer on his way to becoming a star then he falls in love with apollonia appolonia kotero but he has to deal with his wife beating father clarence williams iii and his own self destructive behavior br br i saw this in a theatre in 1984 i was no big fan of prince but i did like the three big songs from this movie purple rain let's get crazy and when doves cry the concert scenes in this movie are great full of energy and excitement unfortunately that's a very small portion of the movie br br the story is screamingly obvious and have been done many times before and much better too the subplots are to put in nicely badly handled the love triangle between the kid appolonia and morris day was so predictable and tired that i actually became insulted his wife beating father is needed for the story but the scenes are so badly handled in acting and direction that i couldn't believe it the script is terrible lousy dialogue and some truly painful comedy routines and there's tons of misogyny here the kid's mother getting beaten the kid hitting appolonia and for no reason appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river also williams' and princes' characters treat women in a horrible manner constantly br br the acting is where this movie really fails appolonia is sweet and beautiful but no actor and prince is easily the worst actor i've ever seen his blank face and wooden dialogue delivery are so bad i couldn't believe it this movie only comes to life during the concert scenes but there aren't really that many the dramatic scenes are so badly acted and handled that they make this movie a chore to sit through they should have just made this a concert film i give this a 2 only for the music
<START> this is an important film it challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention there's a lot to like here the director seems interested in taking apart some of the more tired cinematic conventions unlike a lot of recent american cinema this film takes an interest in what it means to make a movie in the first place the dvd includes a lot of bonus features and there are two commentaries that explain the movie for the viewers still befuddled after an initial viewing when the film screened at sundance it made more than a few audience members uncomfortable and angry this is a sunday morning coffee movie not a friday night party movie for the dedicated viewer it's a treasure trove
<START> king kong vs godzilla 1963 which i recall having rated bomb had been my introduction to cult director honda's work this one isn't necessarily better Â it's just that i've learned to be more tolerant towards such intrinsically lowbrow fare br br here we actually get two kongs for the price of one an ugly and dopey looking giant ape and a robot variation of it which looks even worse the simian creature lives on the island of mondo Â where it's shown fighting a couple of other monsters and befriends a trio of humans naturally it falls for the blonde and bland heroine in fact more intriguing is a femme fatale in cahoots with the film's villainous mad genius Â called dr who and sporting the anemic look and cape usually associated with a vampire br br he kidnaps king kong and hypnotizes it in order to retrieve the element x which is embedded in the icy wastes of the north pole apparently the giant ape is more impervious to radiation than its mechanical counterpart and to ensure its full co operation who even captures its three 'companions' the female agent then has a change of heart helps the heroes one of whom typically is a nondescript american and is killed by who kong eventually escapes and makes it to tokyo where it has a final showdown with the robot the doctor flees the ensuing mayhem in his sub Â which on a request by kong's dreamgirl is summarily trashed by the giant ape
<START> if you like cars you will love this film br br there are some superb actors in the film especially vinnie jones with his typical no nonsense attitude and hardcase appearance the others are not bad either br br there are only two slight flaws to this film firstly the poor plot however people don't watch this film for the plot secondly the glorification of grand theft auto car crime however if people really believe they can steal a ferrari and get away with it then good look to them hope you have a good time in jail br br when i first read that nicolas cage was to act the main role i first thought sweeet but then i thought naaaa you suck but then finally after watching the film i realised yep he suck's only joking he plays the role very well br br i'll end this unusual review by saying if the premature demise of a criminal has in some way enlightened the general cinema going audience as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life and inspired them to change their ways then this death carries with it an inherent nobility and a supreme glory we should all be so fortunate you can say poor criminal i say poor us br br p s angelina jolie voight looks quite nice
<START> no movies have grabbed my attention like this one has you see i have wanted to watch this movie again for over twenty five years the one and only time i saw it was as a teen ager which may have been the year it was released 1977 br br what i do remember of the movie is that it touched those deep held emotions so profoundly that there is still an overwhelming desire to watch it again the intrigue this movie provides by the human element of father son seeking and searching is sure to touch every human soul who watches it why this movie has not been brought out of storage and shown as often as many other movies of lesser depth i do not know br br postscript received copy of movie and after watching it again was delighted to see that my memory held true rating reflects movie content would like to watch this movie on dvd as seeing this 1977 production on a used vhs tape took away from the overall quality
<START> hmm imdb rating of 7 5 good comments bla bla okay two of my friends and me we orderd pizza sat down and wanted to see something as cool as ichi or at least something brainless but funny like versus but naked blood sucked it's a complete waste okay the scene with the woman who likes to eat is quite outstanding but that's it nothing more nothing less i won't summerize the plot other people did already i just wanted to stop the hype but watch it and rate for yourself maybe we can push the rating where it sould be one more thing that comes to my mind the soundtrack is even worse than carpenter ever was okay john's cool 2 10
<START> ah domino is actually a breath of fresh air something new to the cinema world i enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot the varied characters and the intense camera effects i've seen some complain about the camera work and in fact according to the creators themselves the flashy and wild shots were all the culmination of mistakes made through time all of what you see was the desired effect perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before although that's what sets it apart in a deeper aspect what you are seeing is just how domino sees things through her eyes think about it br br when it comes to the story i don't see anything quite bad about it despite it's messy nature according to some it is in fact just a rapid form of storytelling the plot really isn't all that hard to follow if you actually focus on what's going on maybe it's just me because i see movies from many different aspects such as the acting the plot etc i'm no interpreter or anything who picks movies apart it just comes to me with that said i believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed despite it's future as a cult classic blockbuster or whatever br br and the characters well there's no doubting how varied the cast is i believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine jobs portraying their characters effectively that's what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen the characters are all very unique and a plus is that you get to witness a small piece of each one of their lives setting them apart even further basically i personally loved the cast and characters br br all those who bash and burn this film perhaps just don't see it as i do or it just doesn't appeal to them no matter this is a great film in it's own right no it's a great film period
<START> another woo's masterpiece br br this is a best wuxie film i'm ever seen woo rulez forever except some hollywood moments john woo greater director of the century br br maybe hi is not more intellectual than lot of big directors but he is lyrical and spiritual idol of all free mind people br br his movies like the great poetry woo is a movie sheakspeare woo is a movie biron woo is a mozart of bloodshet br br imho violent in woo films is not a directors bloodlust but a instrument of art themes of woo movies is more humanistic that more of the new films
<START> fully deserving its prestigious hollywood award nomination this is an entertaining little gem with lots of pizazz and some delightful surprises outstandingly funny scenes include an hilarious shoot and re shoot of a ww1 trench scene with australian comedian clyde cook as an optimistic non com and the hapless mcdoakes as a boyer colman messenger Â all under the beady eye of ralph sanford's delightfully irascible anguish a lost mcdoakes guided and re guided by equally perplexed jack carson assistant director chandler rejoicing in a mcdoakes sent opportunity i'm going to be a director br br ace comic o'hanlon has a dual role playing both mcdoakes and himself playing mcdoakes oddly richard l bare who does play himself in one or more other entries in the series has turned down that opportunity here in real life bare's a youngish six foot rock hudson lookalike but here he's impersonated by veteran actor over 500 movies jack mower
<START> i saw this film by chance on the small box it has a fantastic and chilling scene about poisonous gas a lot about fanatical patriotism a bit of eroticism i can't believe it's still waiting for 5 votes
<START> someone needed to make a car payment this is truly awful makes jean claude's cyborg look like gone with the wind this is an hour i wish i could sue to get back luckily it produced severe somnolence from which i fell asleep how can actors of this caliber create this dog i would rather spend the time watching algae grow on the side of a fish tank than partake of this wholly awful concoction of several genre i now use the dvd as a coaster on my coffee table 5 99 at walmart is far too much to spend on this movie if you really have to have it wait till they throw them out after they have carried them on the inventory for several years and are frustrated that they would not sell br br please for the love of god let this movie die of obscurity
<START> i spent eight years running movie theatres in the 80's and 90's this was by far the worst film i ever showed to the public one thing that made it so bad was that it put on airs of trying to be a great inspiring film even the great gregory peck could not save this horrid piece of drivel from being far less than mediocre jamie lee curtis in an early non horror film role demonstrated clearly that she had not yet learned to act she's still trying but it isn't getting much better br br i'm sorry and here's the spoiler international nuclear disarmament is never going to happen just because it makes children afraid to play little league baseball even the shows on nick and the disney channel are not stupid enough to try to make us believe that dreck br br this is not worth the time you would waste watching it on cable tv it is not worth the price of a movie rental your dollar would be better spent on an extra package of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you picked because it can only be better than this
<START> true there are many movies much worse then this movie this movie was no manos the hands of fate or troll 2 yes i have seen them both twice but at the same time this movie is no alien predator or even alien vs predator yes even that movie surpassed this movies like this make battlefield earth look like a star wars it is so bad razzie awards lookout your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters this film i'm talking about is of course alone in the dark i'll try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad br br acting i'll first start off with what perhaps was the best component of this film next to the ending credits which played 'wish i had an angel' the acting christian slater must be proud of himself he successfully proved that it is possible to act decent in a film worse then drinking antifreeze though all his awful dialog he had to speak it made me wonder why he just didn't walk off the set halfway perhaps it was because of stephen dorff being in the film as well somebody he wishes he could be but fails at it tara reid is a bad actress but good looking and that's all that really matters in films like these that is not to say the acting was perfect though it was average not good and perhaps the only thing in the film not good br br the soundtrack except for 'wish i had an angel' the soundtrack is pointless and bad heavy medal being pumped into the viewers ears perhaps to disguise the awful story something i will get to soon a long and very expensive 2 cd soundtrack is now up for sale for those musically challenged br br the directing directed by hollywoods favorite director uwe ball who brought us the classic house of the dead telling us yes movies can get this utterly bad and that's just the beginning to my deadly saga of awful movies at least it is said to be directed by uwe ball without being told i would have guessed a monkey was kidnapped from the congo brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the movie under penalty of being shocked the director of photography was probably a camcorder taped onto a skateboard and pushed forward until it hits a wall on the scenes where the camera should stay still it is constantly moving not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action the camera stops for some reason br br the producing who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb i pity the fool sometimes sometimes i'm glad he or she was taught such a lesson to never put money towards garbage worse then dog dung tied up in a bag br br the writing storyboard trying to analise the story is more painful then jamming an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as i possibly could with it right after but i will still attempt it br br edward carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children where to go under science experiments he escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted this is the point where it got so bad i started to laugh out loud then it fast forwards many years later where he's a paranoia detective he get's attacked by some zombie that can't be shot to death kills it and moves on with life later on he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster and he discovers secrets that nobody else knows br br yeah the plot is bad really really bad the film beings with expecting us to read approximately 10 minutes which felt like 100 of random text about an untrue civilization called the abskani the film goes not to have one twist after another more then the audience can handle more then the audience wants to handle more then the audience could ever care about this storyline is rock bottom bad that even double dragon does better br br overall miss out on this movie i gave it a 1 out of 10 but that is because there is no 0
