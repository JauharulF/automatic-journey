<START> it is hard to describe this film and one wants to tried hard not to dismiss it too quickly because you have a feeling that this might just be the perfect film for some 12 years old girl br br this film has a nice concept the modern version of sleeping beauty with a twist it has some rather dreamy shots and some nice sketches of the young boy relationship with his single working mother and his schoolmate a nice start you might say but then it got a bit greedy very greedy it tries to be a science fiction a drama a thriller a possible romantic love story fairy tale a comedy and everything under the sun the result just left the audience feeling rather inadequate for example the scene when the girl played by risa goto finally woken by his yuki kohara kiss instead of being romantic it try's to be scary in order to make us laugh afterwards it is a cheap trick because it ruin all the anticipation and emotion which it was trying to build for the better half of the film br br i have not read the original story the film is base on it is the well known work by the comic book artist osamu tezuka is famous with his intriguing and intricate stories i wonder if all the problems exsist in the original story or did it occur in the adaption it is rather illogical even for someone who is used to the fussy logic of those japanese comic book for instance how did yuki kohara's character manage to get to the hospital in an instant when its suppose to be a long bus ride away to run away risa goto's character in front of the tv cameras right after he saw her live interview on the television br br there are also some scenes that is directly copied very uncreative from other films and they all seem rather pointlessly annoying ie the famous the lion mouth has caugh my hand scene from the roman holiday br br the film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing it fails to be a fairy tale and it did not have enough jokes to be a comedy and strangely there are some scenes that even seem like an unintentional ghost movie nevertheless one should give it credit that it has managed to caputured some of the sentiment of the japanese teenager br br it is by watching this film i have a feeling that there might be some films that should have come with a warning label that said this film might only be suitable for person under the 18 of age it would have definitly been on the poster of this film br br
<START> this movie's origins are a mystery to me as i only know as much as imdb did before i rented it i assume that before starship troopers killshot was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network cable or otherwise the new title of kill shot is comically thrown into the opening sequence the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema the quick cuts cheesy melrose place music and short 2 second close up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you're in for br br and i don't mind at all i rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts casper van dien and denise richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the scifi travesty of starship troopers an excellent book in my opinion not so hot a movie but that's another review after looking it up on imdb my roommate and i surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of troopers and richards own career see bond girl and wild things references here they threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted r rated status coveted in suspense video rental sections that is in any event they should have left it unrated if you're trying to sell it in the suspense softcore porn section br br all in all it's entertaining i hate to spoil the fun of telling you it's a tv pilot though that was the biggest pull while watching it when you expect a cinematic movie and get a tv show the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual br br would i rent it again no would i watch this tv show well why not it's better than baywatch and their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s token black guy who's gay to avoid the tv taboo of inter racial dating token asian japanese i assume from the name koji more adept at science and computers than talking to women beautiful intelligent latina pre med student who has everything going for her except her family's bank account this show probably would have done ok br br but as a movie it just cracks me br br i gave it a 7 out of 10 considering what it was and what it was forced to become it made for a very enjoyable evening and that's all i ask of rentals
<START> it's heart warming to see a movie that doesn't bash males in this one the wife mother leaves her family to get in touch with herself or pursue her libido the father stays with and nurtures the kids letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them
<START> using footage pillaged from planet of dinosaurs this shot on video except for the stolen footage concerns a bunch of people shot into space who land on a dinosaur planet that is don't wait for it is really earth its a five minute sketch stretched to 90 minutes slightly better than chickboxer another in the bad movie police series having a nostalgic home movie feel coupled with good stolen effects this movie is still an impossible slog to get through i'm left to ponder the question are we becoming so uncreative that we're now pillaging old movies not only for plot but also for mismatched footage clearly low budget producers are getting so desperate they really will give us anything to take our money
<START> priyadarshan whenever a person heard his name his first thought would be 'comedy' that is what this man is known for or rather was known for after giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like hungama hera pheri and hunchul his train derailed slowly with movies like chupke chupke and a few others whose names i can't recollect for now now with hideous films like dhol the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be 'torture' br br dhol is a mixture of bad unfunny toilet jokes somewhat of drama poor suspense and idiocracy the only good thing about dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny though not witty and secondly except for kunal khemu and the hysterical grandma the acting was decent br br speaking of the acting i felt that rajpal yadav and sharman joshi were at the top if you compare them with the others in the movie then came tusshar kapoor then tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above the flaw in kunal khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting the grandma firstly resembled a ghost plus she was not funny at all but rather silly br br the plot was the same seen before one four boys behind girls and in need of money but with a few twists there is a 'bad' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb and at last the good wins over the bad and everything is fine the idea of having a dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty br br the worst thing about the movie is its length after an hour or so you get exhausted and want to leave the theater but being a critic it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie the movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different place br br if your mother in law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything then send her for this movie and have fun 3 out of 10
<START> i like movies about ufos which is why i recently decided to rewatch eyes behind the stars after seeing it when i was a kid back in the late 1970s and now i'm compelled to write a review about it because i'm afraid i'll start forgetting everything about it fast you see even though ebts ain't bad it's very dull and nondescript the story is sorta interesting but flat the actors are good but their roles are boring and a little confusing the fx are terribly amateurish but i can overlook something like that if the movie is compelling which unfortunately this one ain't br br also there's very little violence and there's no nudity whatsoever which makes this 1970s italian sci fi opus a true oddity because if there's one thing that distinguishes italian genre movies made in the 1970s from genre movies of other countries made in the same decade it's the astonishing amount of violence and sex to be found in them oddly enough because of the almost complete lack of exploitive elements ebts stands out from the rest of the pact i don't know if this can be seen as a compliment though personally i can enjoy a movie without sex and violence but i think ebts needed more violence and some sex here and there to spice it up because it is so deadly dull and dry and the special effects aren't that special br br the story itself is actually interesting it's a combo of the x files and antonioni's blowup a photographer accidentally captures aliens on film during a fashion shoot in the country the aliens know they were captured on film and they proceed to kidnap the photographer and a model subsequently destroying any evidence of their presence on earth the problem starts when the model meets a man at the recently abducted photographer's apartment this taking place just before she's to be abducted herself the man takes some of the negatives and leaves with the aliens having no knowledge of the missing negatives the whole story is about this man wanting to know more about the aliens and a secret spy group who want to get a hold of the negatives the majority of the movie centers around boring political intrigue in the spy vs spy variety the ufo element of the story is almost unimportant and could have easily been replaced by any cold war mcguffin but as dull as eyes behind the stars is it does resemble the x files a lot i wonder if chris carter saw this movie anyway the best thing in ebts are the pov shots which are creepy and effective but the rest is almost completely forgettable including the goofy looking aliens br br even though i've been mostly negative about this film i sorta cherish it nonetheless i still remember the effective ad campaign which scared me when i saw it as a kid and i own the video the film could have been so much more if it had been done properly oh well
<START> i must admit i do not hold much of new age mumbo jumbo when people exchange energy i always wonder how much kj is actually exchanged and how it may contribute to solving the global warming problem when energy is enforced i always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and still are without nobel prizes when people feel how well instinct enables them to flawlessly navigate through the complexities of life i wonder how they fail to do a simple thing like finding the train station br br but then again this is not the first movie with plot holes and most of them i find perfectly acceptable and entertaining if this were the case with the celestine prophecy i wouldn't burn this movie down but unfortunately it isn't every actor seems to be bored out of his head and unable to grasp what he are actually supposed to be doing on location this results in many ah s and oh s like i tend to do when talking about quantum physics with somebody who actually knows what he is talking about and pretend to understand br br the direction is uninspired as well you might expect something more from the guy who did what dreams may come but hey i supposed he got well paid for the job and adopted the attitude of a new york taxi driver it's your money buddy the only one who seems to be having fun is all time bad guy jÃ¼rgen prochnow not only does he have a job he is one of the few actors in this movie who may have a few wise cracks at this eternal and terribly boring new age chatter br br this movie is much like one of these dinner dates when you find out that your date is actually a horrible bore who seems to be unable to shut up at one moment in time it seems the words turn into small ping pong balls that are thrown to your head incessantly until it hurts br br if you want to have a good time and have to choose between this movie and sticking safety pins in your eyelids take my advise choose the latter
<START> of the many problems with this film the worst is continuity and re editing it on vhs for a college cable channel many years ago i tried to figure out what exactly went wrong what seems to have happened is that they actually constructed a much longer film and then chopped it down for standard theatrical viewing how much longer to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriously br br that's staggering what could the halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here their previous film white zombie was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early universal studios monster films the mummy dracula etc and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in north america would know from popular magazines br br revolt of the zombies to the contrary appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war this would not only explain the opening and the change of dean jagger's character into a megalomaniac but it also explains why the zombies don't actually do much in the film besides stand around look frightening and wait for orders they're just allegorical soldiers not the undead cannibals we've all come to love and loathe in zombie films br br i am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics but i think a film ought to be entertaining first and only later maybe educational and definitely a film about zombies ought to be about zombies br br truly one of the most bizarre films in hollywood history but not one i can recommend even for historic value
<START> this was one of those wonderful rare moments in t v that i wished i'd captured forever on vhs won't it ever air again br br it was so creative and i remember it was aired once a week and the wait for the next episode was excruciating i want to see it all again i want to buy it i want what i can't have not even on ebay br br so having ranted enough it was by far one of the best series the 80's put out it should be considered a classic but is lost in space at least this website and wikipedia mention it sob br br it was utterly appealing funny flirtatious and original maybe not like sherlock holmes original i actually think quintin is far more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and chalky holmes ever could
<START> if you liked the first two films then i'm sorry to say you're not going to like this one this is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video probably tv made sequel the still idiotic but nice scientist wayne szalinski rick moranis is still living with his family and he has his own company szalinski inc unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue wayne is so stupid he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother then he shrinks his wife and sister in law too now the adults have to find a way to get the kids of the house to get them bigger pretty much a repeat of the other two with only one or two new things e g a toy car roller coaster swimming in dip etc pretty poor
<START> words can't describe how bad this movie is i can't explain it by writing only you have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how horrible a movie really can be not that i recommend you to do that there are so many clichÃ©s mistakes and all other negative things you can imagine here that will just make you cry to start with the technical first there are a lot of mistakes regarding the airplane i won't list them here but just mention the coloring of the plane they didn't even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline but instead used a 747 painted in the original boeing livery very bad the plot is stupid and has been done many times before only much much better there are so many ridiculous moments here that i lost count of it really early also i was on the bad guys' side all the time in the movie because the good guys were so stupid executive decision should without a doubt be you're choice over this one even the turbulence movies are better in fact every other movie in the world is better than this one
<START> after fatih akins first work im juli which was fairly good he created a really gorgeous italian family epic its a german movie which is unfortunately a bad precondition cause we rareley produce more than moderate movies but this movie makes some very good snapshots of the time then solino is about a italian immigrant who arrives in the ruhr region of germany during the 60s the immigrant and his family then start the first pizza restaurant in the region the characters are excellent drawn especially gigi the main actor you live every second every feeling he does his brother played by moritz bleibtreu isnt that good well you just dont believe him the role but the character is wellbalanced and fits perfectly into this script i feel an urgent need to compare the style of this movie with the style of the godfather many people will probably hate this movie say its boring not much tension yes but an outrageous movie 9 out of 10
<START> using buster keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice he may have been the most talented comedian of the silent age this gives him a chance to display those talents in a little time travel story he get hooked up with a guy living in modern times and it becomes obvious that we are best left in our own times keaton is able to do his sight gags very well i've heard his voice before i believe he did some of those beach party films playing some vacuous characters just to earn a few bucks serling seemed to have respect for him and portrayed him that way it's not a bad story it shows how one reacts when we wish for something we don't have and get that wish
<START> every sunday a trio of buds get together at a nyc diner to boast about their sexual conquests of the night before sometimes they're joined by a newlywed ex comrade and hoochie hunter who hangs on them like a puling barnacle they're unabashed horn dogs corn dogs and mia who witnesses them on the prowl decides that they need to be taught a lesson dammit ergo she'll date and dump why not all three of them br br gasp what a wild idea what a radical naughty gal women now have the right to date and sleep around as much as they want to as much as men do even br br there is one solitary laughable element in whipped namely the fact that not once during the amigo's detailed discussions of their bodily functions and the tantric talents of the bed partners they trash do the other customers in the diner turn around and say dude we're trying to eat here indeed a heh heh gag has an older lady eagerly weigh in on the useful sexual properties of certain beverages a big fat kermit the frog sheesh to that br br it's truly unfortunate that a buddy movie with a great setting a smart cute heroine and three possible pairings had to have such a cop out ending br br p s 30 whip oosh sound effects to the screenwriter for use of the phrase you go girl it was tired in 2000 and it's tired now br br save your time and watch some sex and the city reruns
<START> just to mention one more thing about gentleman jim i agree with all the assessments that make this among errol flynn's greatest outings in a career of great outings i would think this role playing boxer jim corbett is more like his real personality than the swashbucklers he was typecast as flynn seemed like a party animal from his memoirs and was one guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life the extra thing i wanted to point out is notice the great montages transitions and still inserts that punctuate the film although the director was raoul walsh a frequent collaborator with flynn with cinematographer sid hickox the montages were made up by an up and coming editor named don siegel i never knew siegel went that far back but he's listed right in the credits he would go on to a great career as action director himself
<START> to me the final scene in which harris responds to the press corp is worthy of viewing this intelligent and timeless slice of politics especially the campaign phase if only the real life pols would respond in the intelligent articulate manner as did mr harris then the arrogant self serving members of the press would perhaps think twice before surfacing irrelevant confrontational garbage that has absolutely nothing to do with a candidates abilities to effectively handle the challenges of the office for which he she is pursuing
<START> foxes is one movie i remember for it's portrayal of teenagers in the late 1970's as i am exactly jodie foster's age i related to this movie it deals with the frustrations temptations relationships rebellion of youth the soundtrack is great with inspiring rock eg more than a feeling by boston and sad numbers like on the radio by donna summer the music of my late teens yep i'll always remember this one even if it wasn't huge
<START> flavia la monaca muslmana aka flavia the heretic of 1974 is a truly disturbing and uncompromising piece of italian exploitation cinema that to a certain extent follows a somewhat feminist premise though the level of sleaze and brutality would probably disgust the majority of feminists set mostly in a convent and with a nun as the eponymous central protagonist great performance by the wonderful florinda bolkan flavia the heretic may be referred to as a 'nunsploitation' film however this film differs quite drastically from the typical nunsploitation flicks from the time as it doesn't so much focus on the nunsploitation elements such as lesbianism sadistic lesbian punishments etc personally i saw more similarities to the hexploitation flicks of the time such as mark of the devil even though this one doesn't treat the topic of witch hunts which focus on the brutal execution of christian fundamentalism in the middle ages and early modern period br br italy around 1600 after witnessing her despotic father behead a wounded muslim soldier young flavia is forced to become a nun in a convent when her father condemns a fellow nun to a torturous death for a small misdemeanor years later falvia's disgust with male violence against women turns into hatred against the despotic church and she joins a band of arabic scavengers br br one thing is for sure flavia the heretic is not for the faint hearted and neither is it for those who want happy endings director gianfranco mingozzi obviously tried to make his film as realistic and disturbing as possible especially in its nasty scenes the many torture and execution scenes are extremely disturbing with skinnings spikings and other gruesome scenes in explicit detail the most shocking scene probably being the torture of the young nun quite in the beginning of the film the violence here is never superfluous however after all this gruesome methods actually were reality in the time the film is set in the film is very well made with realistic costumes fantastic settings an elegant cinematography and a great score by nicola piovani the stunningly beautiful and great florinda bolkan has proved her talent in many great italian cult productions including lucio fulci's giallo masterpiece non si sevizia un paperino of 1972 she delivers another great charismatic performance here and i couldn't imagine another actress fitting as well in the role as she does the film has some minor inconsistencies e g why does the rigid church let bizarre cult followers into convents in the first place however it is overall amazing how realistic this film is flavia the heretic should definitely not be missed by my fellow fans of italian exploitation cinema this is a great exploitation flick overall though it definitely is a deeply depressing one and therefore should be watched in the right mood highly recommended to fans of disturbing exploitation cinema 7 5 10
<START> i remember seeing this film at the west end theater in louisville kentucky when i was a boy the scene where dr carmus finds the gardener's coffin and the breathing dead body therein was the scariest part of the movie for me only intensified by the darkness of the film i also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end until i recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the blackwoods was changed from blackblood due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people sir thomas blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family i also noticed that as foster first enters the gate of the cemetery he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate where he meets his end i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers
<START> i cannot believe i wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible film i kept hoping it was going to get better by the end but boy was i wrong the plot was abysmal the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were awful not even the 2 beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess however i cannot lie some of the lines in this film were quite memorable such as when the asian boy says '' i lost my virginity to the babysitter so f stereotypes '' br br please do not waste your time with this crash unless u are prepared or want to have a good laugh maybe that way u can watch it to rip this movie with some mates
