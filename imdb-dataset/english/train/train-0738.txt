<START> thankfully as a student i have been able to watch diagnosis murder for a number of years now it is basically about a doctor who solves murders with the help of his lapd son a young doctor and a pathologist dm provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment what made it different from the many other cop shows and worth watching many times over was its cast and quality of writing the main cast gave good performances and dick van dyke's entertainer roots shone through with the use of magic dance and humor the best aspects of dm was the fast pace witty scripts and of course the toe tapping score sadly it has been unfairly compared to murder she wrote dm is far superior boasting more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety now it is gone tv is a worse place gone are the days of feelgood family friendly cop shows now there is just depressing 'gritty' ones
<START> what can i say about seven pounds well i watched on a flight from seattle to tokyo and as that flight was long and boring the movie definitely didn't help will smith's character ben thomas is almost completely unlikable even with his redemption in the end the movie's two hour plus run time wastes most of the screen time with random garbage that just strings the plot along as slow as possible in the movies defense rosario dawson's character adds a little life to the film although not much i don't understand how anyone could actually cry during this film when all i wanted to do was turn it off also will smith kills himself with a jellyfish at the ended proving that killing yourself with a jellyfish is the stupidest way to die
<START> i am puerto rican and this is one of the worst documentary of i've ever seen of any type you can see that the people on it are clueless they don't know much about puerto rico and its culture they claim to be puerto rican because they are from puerto rican descendants but they probably know less than others who are not from there you can see while they are talking that they are contradicting themselves if you would like to see a real and i mean a real genuine documentary from puerto rico then you must see mi puerto rico that's a serious real documentary not like this piece of junk rosie perez based this documentary on herself i thought it was suppose to be about puerto ricans they keep repeating i didn't know well that's about the only thing they got right on this so called documentary i hate to see such a piece of garbage being done using the name of the island it brings down the standards
<START> i saw this in detroit in what must have been its original run i literally rolled into the aisle of the theater it was that funny i haven't seen it since but would love to where do you get a copy anybody saying anything about it being dated or overdone are for my money just a bunch of poseurs each skit is either wickedly erotically or perversely hilarious each one there is not a weak one included the opening sequence for instance which parodies 2001 features gorilla go go dancers with pendulous breasts felinni would have filmed it had he the wicked wit if you come to this film with an open mind and a blithely sneering heart you'll pencil it right into your very best list
<START> for anyone who has seen and fallen in love with the stage musical a chorus line the movie is a shoddy substitute not only are songs cut but unnecessary plot twists added new dance sequences choreographed and let's face it richard attenborough just doesn't know how to film dancers br br onstage michael bennett's a chorus line was just that michael bennett his idea his choreography his direction his gift to broadway and the rest of the world it was two hours of hard hitting in your face realism that really made you feel for these boys and girls the movie however lacks empathy and depth the actors look like they are auditioning for a chorus line rather than actually auditioning every move every line of dialogue seems so weighted and planned michael douglas especially as zach is too in control for us to believe that he is this extraordinarily bitchy choreographer even when he throws his temper tantrums you never quite believe him because every gesture every accented word every nuance is so obviously rehearsed and as for him not dancing kevin kline auditioned for the role of zach on broadway michael bennett loved his reading but kline couldn't dance and ultimately lost the part how i wish they had done the same for douglas a chorus line is supposed to be a show about nobodies and aside from a few recognizable faces vicki frederick who played cassie on broadway as sheila and khandi alexander of tv's newsradio as one of the many auditioning dancers you're not supposed to know any of these people because you do know these people having a star in any of the roles is a terrible decision when you focus on michael douglas and his ranting instead of on the girls and boys on the line and their stories you lose something br br it is truly unfortunate that the best sequence in the show montage hello twelve hello thirteen hello love is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song entitled surprise surprise that surprisingly received a nomination at the oscars cassie's mirror dance has a new song and tragically boring choreography one wonders why they bothered to shoot a movie version at all if they were going to mess with a working formula this much br br for fans of musical theatre and those who enjoyed the stage version this movie is a sad mockery of everything they cherished and loved for those who never got to see the original production either on broadway or on tour this movie is the only reference they will have to go by and they'll have to wonder just how it got to be the longest running musical in broadway history until a little show called cats overtook it in the late 1990's but that is a different story and don't even get me started there
<START> strange enough all the previous comments merely described the beginning and left the details over i feel a necessity to confirm that this is a family work since marina vlady was also robert hossein's wife and the excellent jazz music was written by te director's father andrÃ© under these circumstances no wonder it was a really good thriller seen when issued and immediately identified with the music the suspense was flawless and maintained throughout until the end robert hossein at the time one of the best european players managed to impose himself also as a top screen and stage director he's still putting up great stage shows with a preference for religious subjects harry carasso paris france
<START> first of all this film is glacially slow moving and i can see most viewers losing patience with it altogether in the first thirty minutes br br the film's subject matter was one i think would form the basis of an excellent film what was most lacking here was a plot that would advance the underlying themes br br it's unfortunate because in the hands of a writer like say lanford wilson i think symbolism like a mountain lion invading a school campus could take on great tragic proportions without being heavy handed br br i think with a good script supporting the film the same filmmaker with the same tastes and even with the same actors who didn't really even get a chance to impress me might have been able to present a meaningful and touching depiction of the pains and struggles that a boy goes through when he develops a powerful crush on an older boy that he admires br br however i'm sorry to say that without this foundation and armed with a vague dull witted and vastly uninteresting script without any sort of plot in sight and lacking any sort of sensible structure for example after viewing it i believe you will find that you cannot point to climactic scenes and instead will find yourself enumerating well maybe that scene or that one were climaxes the result is 95 minutes of tedium br br without a good plot we never get terribly interested in any of the characters their trials and difficulties are simply dull and boring br br without a good plot dramatic devices and surrealistic directorial liberties become puzzling and confusing rather than enhancements to the story line i never really could believe for example the creation of leah and i think that most viewers would be utterly baffled by the conventional way in which her telephone calls were filmed br br as the film stands i'm afraid it's one i cannot recommend at all what i can never understand is why a film like this one isn't re made by an enterprising film maker instead of all the mediocre remakes of films that were superlatively good in the first release all it needs is a good script written by good writers and i think this film could be easily turned into an unforgettable classic about an aspect of male coming of age that is rarely treated in drama all the elements that were so tedious and seemed so recherche in the film the messages written on the boy's belly the leah scenes the television screen fantasies could become rich if underpinned with a good storyline br br i see in quite a few comments that people are talking of this film as somehow being about a gay subject and i think that's mistaken obviously the crush depicted is that of a newly pubescent boy on an older adolescent boy but the character of logan is far too young to have settled on any particular sexual choices and indeed in his depicted masturbation fantasies we see all sorts of stimuli sexual and non sexual as we would expect in a very young boy like him i believe crushes such as logan's are common among male youths who grow up to have a decided preference for female sex partners
<START> fragmentaric movie about a couple of people in austria during a heatwave this kind of movie has been done more often and most of all better the stories don't really have anything to do with each other apart from the pathetic finale 'people are cruel' ugly flesh unpleasant people and a movie that goes on way too long without really making a point ultra realistic hardly boring indeed not even gorgeous franzisca weiss can save this one 3 10
<START> good movie good music good background and an acceptable plot but the main point again as his movies tend to be the man is the best actor in idia and can turn dust into gold nana patekar this may be his second best performance after parinda others may disagree although other movies are not far behind one man that will never ever disappoint you br br good movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without you can see in his movies others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skins but this man is really something elase br br the movie is cool the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good a must watch
<START> most stoogephiles consider this to be the best stooges short bar none and they're right curly is a scream dressed up in drag as senorita cucaracha and moe and larry are in top form as senor mucho and senor gusto respectively christine mcintyre's beautiful operatic voice is given full rein she actually was a trained opera singer and it's wonderful the great gino corrado is hilarious as a pompous italian singer terrorized by the stooges at a society party some truly funny gags good direction and very tight editing make this rise to the very top of the stooges' prolific output what's even more amazing is that curly was having severe health problems at the time and in several of the shorts he made during this period you can see that he is obviously ill his timing is way off he speaks very slowly and haltingly and has trouble getting around fortunately his health was in an upswing when he made this film and it shows classic stooge comedy and enjoyed by even non stooge fans i had a girlfriend who couldn't stand the stooges but even she laughed at this one a must see
<START> how you could say that peaches with its complex narrative dealing with a multitude of issues is a small tv idea is beyond me besides i can think of many films that have a small tv idea in their plots your obvious dislike of the tv industry sue smith has failed to rise above her television background is confusing particularly as you are having such a great time working in tv if only we could all be so talented as ms smith no i am not a friend or relative afi award winning brides of christ road from coorain etc all made for tv come to think of it what about those other small tv ideas like against the wind bodyline the dismissal scales of justice blue murder water under the bridge etc i think peaches is a good entertaining film which had me interested and most of my friends as well from start to finish it is far from flawless yet i think it is among the best australian films i have seen over the last couple of years who knows with a few more viewings there's so much to think about it might just be up there with classics like the year my voice broke the devil's playground i really did enjoy this film much more than somersault and three dollars these films i think had their moments surreal atmospheric realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues but as for sheer entertainment for mr and mrs average movie goer and me it was very ordinary if not boring when i go to a movie i am always conscious of the audience's reaction to a film through in cinemas reactions and overheard conversations in the foyer and loo some came out of peaches shaking their heads some with negative criticisms but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience
<START> this movie is not just bad not just corny it is repulsive something about daphne about the creepy call girl about the whole damn and i use the word literally film radiates a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress this film makes my skin crawl makes me regret having reproductive organs and makes me feel unclean br br one of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept a creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results rather than the clichÃ© worst nightmare and the overdone twisted wish is a truly fascinating film idea br br thought the reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights during the day bright lights don't show up well so they could go anywhere br br count the hobgoblins four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio and yet at least nine of the pernicious plush toys are killed throughout the course of the movie br br discussion question if you had a frigid demanding unappreciative girlfriend would you enter garden tool combat with a military chunkhead explain
<START> i've read a lot of comments about the film and how it's so hard for people to believe that it is a sequel to henry fool and even though it technically is i think that fay grim needs to be looked at as an entirely different film just because it is the sequel doesn't mean that it has to be a direct continuation of the first and i enjoyed that so much about it the whole point of the film was to change direction from the first which makes sense because the movie isn't called henry fool 2 it's fay grim all that aside the film i thought was so well made and thought out that it actually surprised me i was expecting to rent another nearly released straight to video film and have to endure 2 hours of bad editing and an almost hard to follow story line aka parker's last direct to video feature the oh in ohio but this was so surprisingly well focused that it almost doesn't seem so which i absolutely loved there are so many nuances in the film making and writing that i crave to see in films but never do the cinematography was brilliant due to it's simplicity and truly making the film seem 'grim' throughout in terms of setting the writing was so well put together as well whoever said this movie isn't as witty as henry fool needs to watch again and actually listen i almost can't even begin to explain how actually hilarious it was and pertinent and well parker posey who could complain the scene in which fool and jalal were talking in the dark was so captivating and emotional and i thought the spy ness throughout the film was just so hilarious and spot on in hindsight because i do agree that at times during you kind of felt lost the main thing that struck me so powerfully about the film and i believe the point of the film was parker's love and naivety about fool which was so endearing and turned yes very quickly from denial to outright passion the last five minutes of the film were perfect obviously there were things that weren't excellent but nothing is perfect some of the acting was poor and at times i did think that some of the new back story and dialogue about terrorism got a little hard to follow and out of hand but in the end you got it and didn't even mind that at the time it may have slipped from your comprehension this may also have to do with goldblum's tendency to talk extremely fast on the whole i would say that it was probably one of the best films i've seen this year stylistically pleasing clever and witty writing performances that were so impressive i now have gained new respect for some of the actors and a truly touching film and don't forget a complete departure from fool which was the point
<START> i can't believe i've just spent one and a half hours watching such a weak film if there is only one film you have to miss this is the one br br robert is a teenager whose father's died recently so he starts hanging out with some local anti social teenagers and using drugs all these make him subconsciously more violent and at last such subconsciousness explodes br br the first thing is that i don't think i can find any sense or trace of great ecstasy in this film not in any single character if the director considers what i saw in the last couple of minutes as great ecstasy i have to say that that's not even close br br the use of cinematography is also not mature most of the time i couldn't see any facial expressions from the actors and i didn't feel the body language was sufficient enough to make an impact maybe the crew was just so tired that they fixed the camera there to include everything in the settings everybody happy except the audience br br the plot is particularly weak there are a lot of unrelated scenes and talking which might be supposed to be related but they are really so random that you can never pull them all together perhaps unless you're the one who wrote them br br in the one and a half hour you may find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all other time there are just people walking talking and moving so i really can't comment on acting here br br nice choice of music in the last couple of minutes though maybe this is the only good thing br br i have never given a film a 1 but this film certainly deserves it at least you laugh when you watch scary movies this is a film about when a failed attempt to portray troubled teenagers meets extremely disturbed audience hope you fall into neither group
<START> wow and i thought that any steven segal movie was bad every time i thought that the movie couldn't get worse it proved me wrong the story was good but the actors couldn't carry it off also they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done for instance you don't handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for the biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl she is a weak actress and i felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was the whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me i like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff so that almost seemed depressing i thought that the characters wern't explained well enough you didn't find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them
<START> this movie has taken a lot of stick it was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking nicolas cage's career the thing i don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic oscar contender of a movie it's just some brilliant bruck buster action at its best fast cars quick editing and a great soundtrack it does exactly what it says on the tin also for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat it has everything ferraris mercs a hummer and lets not forget eleanor i think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie and personally a better movie at all then again maybe that's just me
<START> anchors aweigh is the product of the classic mgm musical production unit and on the whole the film is every enjoyable Â good music by jule styne and others excellent dancing by gene kelly and even a passable job by frank sinatra and a funny well paced script the only major element i would criticize would be the casting of kathryn grayson whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudo operatic warbling from the petite miss br br kelly plays a naval serviceman named joseph brady a man with a mythic reputation around the ship as a lover but whose valentino charms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less cocksure friend with the improbable middle american name of clarence sinatra upon receiving 3 days of shore leave for saving clarence's life joe reluctantly agrees to help clarence find a girl based on the dubious premise that he owes him something for saving his life they are drafted by a policeman rags ragland who needs them to help coax a precocious young boy dean stockwell who wants to join the navy into returning home to aunt susan grayson at first it is clarence who is interested in wooing aunt susan but eventually kelly's character emerges as the more likely candidate br br there are several standout musical scenes but nothing to come close to kelly's more famous work in films like singin' in the rain and american in paris the closest we get is a gimmicky sequence with kelly's character in a fantasy sequence dancing with jerry the mouse from tom and jerry although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse it's a startling sequence for its time but doesn't have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time i actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation where kelly was using semi balletic moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of alice in wonderland br br eventually the characters find their way to susan's favorite bar a somewhat sanitized mexican restaurant bar in tijuana there the patrons happily allow ms grayson to chirp her arias with abandon and the management becomes very excited at the opportunity that clarence and joe have extended for her to sing with their friend jose iturbi playing himself with a light humorous touch of course they've never met their friend iturbi and they spend much of the film's length trying to reach him in an amusing scene sinatra's character meets iturbi but mistakes him for a piano tuner and urges him to abandon tuning pianos and try a professional career sneaking into the studio and the hollywood bowl where iturbi is rehearsing a surreal symphony comprised of dozens of young piano players Â you haven't seen anything like this outside of 1000 fingers of dr t iturbi himself is a kind of a god figure in the story Â he represents the opportunity for salvation from the drudgery of unfulfilling work and the possibility for fame and artistic achievement for the heroine everyone is 100 sure that as soon as mr iturbi so much as hears ms grayson her operatic career will be a reality the 3 primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant mythological figure Â a lot of the film's charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very down to earth real mannerisms of the maestro and speaking of iturbi's contributions to the film he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his orchestral interpretation of donkey serenade br br when all is said and done this is a film that nobody who enjoys musicals will want to miss the majority of the music was written for this film a nice contrast to recycled soundtracks for other kelly opuses like rain and american kelly is still at his early peak adventurous and boisterous in both his dances and his interpretation of the character sinatra's voice was never in better form and he rarely had better songs to sing stockwell is a charming addition to the clan and grayson's character is endearing when she isn't posturing on stage iturbi adds that well grounded but sophisticated tone that perfectly matches the atmosphere and style of the classic era mgm musical this is one of the better ones
<START> i saw the 10p m showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back as i don't actually pay for movies anymore i didn't really find any redeeming qualities br br there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger in mind more than age as this film is rated r male audience the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well i know you all want to hear samuel l say his infamous line but let's be honest it's a whole lot of hype for very little pay off the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen br br now i am a reasonable man i knew going into the theater that i wasn't going to be seeing casablanka and i am at least thankful that this film is an original albiet inane idea and not some re make or franchise spin off however to be honest if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months
<START> this 1947 film stars and was directed and written by orson welles with a funky irish accent and also stars the gorgeous rita hayworth with less appealing short blonde hair so i've hung out with orson before in touch of evil and citizen kane and the third man etc but this was my first rita hayworth interaction our first meeting went well she does a superb job playing the frightened cagey elsa married to a crippled millionaire lawyer mike welles and elsa fall for each other he wants to run away with her she doesn't know if she can live without the things money can buy elsa her husband and his partner bicker and bite just like the sharks mike describes attacking each other and his foretelling proves just too true several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house think the ending shootout in the man with the golden gun which borrowed heavily from this scene i wasn't sure who the murderer was until the end br br this movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon the dish centers on the sea it is subtle sour and pungent all to great effect these might not be the best fresh shrimp but good quality frozen shrimp from costco the flavorful sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp as you fill up on a healthy but filling alternative to more mundane common fare 7 10 http blog myspace com locoformovies
