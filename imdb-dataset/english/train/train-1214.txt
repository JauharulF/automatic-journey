<START> i really liked this movie it was cute i enjoyed it but if you didn't that is your fault emma roberts played a good nancy drew even though she isn't quite like the books the old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times but she looks good on them to me the rich girls didn't have outfits that made them look rich i mean it looks like they got all the clothes blindfolded at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together all of the outfits were tacky especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits i do not want to make the movie look bad because it definitely wasn't just go to the theater and watch it you will enjoy it
<START> in spite of sterling work by the supporting actors and an intelligent script by alan plater this film suffers from a fatal flaw the lack of charm of the central character actor one of the characters describes richard e grant's character as a whining little turd and unfortunately this sums him up perfectly there is nothing about him or his performance to make it credible that his girlfriend and upper class publisher friend would spend so much time and emotional effort on him he is rude arrogant selfish self destructive and thoroughly annoying the part called for an actor who can make you love him even when he is being a prate a ewan mcgregor for example br br all of the witty satire on the class system etc was wasted thanks to this irritating and thoroughly unlikeable performance all i wanted to do was shake him and tell him to get over himself
<START> superman ii the richard donner cut should be a fan's dream come true at long last footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life a director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored it seems like a winning situation and then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this esoteric dream is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence while it's entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project and it is only a very few times br br you know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics but then we start seeing new footage alternates from superman the movie for the trial and that first bit of hesitation fades away hey this is pretty neat things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from stm intermixed with new effects for this project and it doesn't convince at all and from this point on it never ever lets up it's probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was you'll believe a man can fly it's difficult to believe anything shown on screen here the best effects in this are from the original productions br br another issue with this re cut a lot of it just doesn't make sense the only reason any of it really works is because we've all seen the theatrical version of superman ii a movie that does make sense lester's superman ii fills in the holes of this assembly part of this could be because donner didn't get to complete shooting the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little lester material as possible what we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes superman iv look airtight and coherent br br after viewing this one gets the sense that while lester was faithful and comfortable using donner material michael thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by lester the best scenes in the donner cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of superman ii that includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence not ironically both were filmed by donner but anything else from that movie filmed by lester is re edited in such a hasty fashion that it now makes lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing while lester honored the donner material lester here is thrown under the bus br br so is there anything good in this release well marlon brando is in it and that's neat to see in fact watching any of the material shot by donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as superman the movie but that only highlights the problems of this release any of the major scenes really just lois jumping and scenes with marlon brando would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used sloppy edits and bad decisions br br watch the opening scene at the daily planet why are we looking at jackie cooper's back as he calls for lois and clark at the end why do we have lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by jackie cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on i was initially confused by this because i expected to see lois the entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this br br battle scenes are a mess too with no geography between cuts it's just random action of course the major action scenes were shot by lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of donner outtakes or alternates they should have used more of lester's footage but probably had too much pride to admit that br br the sloppiness extends to the military missile as well as noted elsewhere the missile shown in the donner cut bears the designation xk 10 while we all know it's the xk 101 a blind man in stm knows that the producers of this assembly who tried so hard to honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production for all the supposed care that was put into this the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable br br the entire affair would probably be easier to digest if warner's didn't make this a separate release here in the states as it is we're expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a play all option it's really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but after that initial viewing i expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else i know after my experience of watching this i had new respect for lester's version it's by no means perfect but lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief he managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so while this new re cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history
<START> this was incredible meaning that it was hard to believe that the forgotten tribe would make this astounding migration twice a year and that the filmmakers cooper and schoedsack didn't stage some of the scenes and shots but what shots they are the cinematography under mostly extreme conditions is brilliant and the score of iranian music added to the video release give this memorable documentary an added richness br br i had the pleasure of seeing this and kon tiki on the same weekend which was a thrill and certainly made me see how tough and hardy and brave people can be whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science
<START> by some happy coincidence the same year that jimmy stewart and kim novak made alfred hitchcock's haunting masterpiece vertigo they also made this light comedy perhaps the two actors needed to do it after undergoing the heaviness of the hitchcock film at any rate this a great companion piece to vertigo as it again explores a very un likely but powerful romance in fact the film can be seen as the flip side of vertigo with it's happy ending here again novak undergoes a transformation in vertigo she essentially plays two women and here she 'transforms' from witch to mortal stewart is again bewitched and for awhile tormented by his love for her unlike vertigo the two come together in bell book and candle a perfect antidote for the hitcock movie again the dynamics of love and attraction are examined but in an altogether different vein the cast is terrific lemmon hilarious as novak's warlock brother and elsa lancaster giving a classic performance as the aunt ernie kovacs as the alcoholic cult writer and of course hermoine gingold playing novak's competitor are all great the scene with stewart drinking the potion is comedy at it's best anyone who has seen vertigo or even if you haven't should see this memorable light comedy
<START> i saw this movie a long time ago luckily it was for free i have to be one of the maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater i don't remember a whole bunch of it but i do remember i was incredibly bored the plot made no sense and when i came out of the theater the only thing i could say was at least now i know what the worst movie i ever saw was i just was incredibly bothered by one thing if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun low enough for humans to survive why can't they turn it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty how stupid do they think we are
<START> imagine the plight of richard a painter whose real passion is flying when we first meet him he is seen atop a building in london wearing his home made wings he has ripped his canvases and other works at the height of his despair and fashions a flying device for his jump when he falls into the protective police contraption he doesn't suffer a scratch but it lands him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service richard whose relationship with anne apparently ended badly decides to relocate to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large barn he plans to use to construct his own plane br br richard ends up trying to help jane harchard reluctantly she is a young woman suffering from a l s or lou gehrig's disease and is confined to a motorized wheel chair jane is extremely intelligent but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary she uses a hand held device to speak sometimes as her speech is not clear what jane loves to do is to lose her virginity at any cost jane and richard clash as they meet but a mutual tolerance soon makes them comfortable with one another br br jane who watches porn on her computer has a notion for finding someone like richard gere in american gigolo who will for a fee have sex with her when richard takes her to london they find the right man for the job his fee is exorbitant but they agree since they have no money richard decides to rob a big bank unfortunately things don't go according to plan when jane realizes that she can't go through with what she had wanted at the end richard takes jane for a ride in his crudely built plane for the thrill of her life something that brings them closer as they find an affinity with one another br br peter greengrass directed this quirky film which presents an unusual situation jane is clearly not the romantic heroine in mainstream films and yet she has such a sweet aura about her that is hard not to feel for her and what she is trying to accomplish mr greengrass shows an affinity richar hawkins' material he wrote for the film the movie doesn't try to be cute or give a rosy picture of a young woman afflicted with an incurable disease br br helena bonham carter is the main reason for watching the film she makes a wonderful jane on the other hand kenneth branagh doesn't seem too well suited for this type of comedy somehow he has problems of his own in the way he interprets richard gemma jones has some good moments as anne richard's former love br br the theory of flight shows a good director no doubt peter greengrass will go to bigger and better things
<START> with the runaway success of god's army every mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now in the case of the recent the other side of heaven this wasn't at all a bad thing that film while not great was quite good the singles ward however is not br br telling the story of a young divorced mormon guy thrust back into single life the writing and shooting style of the singles ward is in many ways very similar to the 80s comedy ferris bueller's day off however the similarities end there while ferris bueller was funny original and well acted as far as stupid comedies like this ever are the singles ward is completely the opposite it tries very hard to be funny however 90 of the gags either fall flat or are cliches and jokes you've probably heard a million times before the other 10 seem to be thrown in to fill out the time and the acting while not awful is amaturish at best br br in addition if you're not either a mormon yourself or very very familiar with mormon culture you won't get hardly anything at all whereas god's army and the other side of heaven were appealing to a broad range of viewers both inside and outside of the mormon church this film is most definitely one big inside joke and even if you get it it's just not that funny
<START> this is a great movie for all generation x'ers what a different world the america of 1972 was compared to our psychotic 21st century you can get a sense of what an 1972 america gone by was like by watching this movie i found that the clothing and the car styles brought back to me fond memories of a much better country than we have now just think back then there were only 4 or 5 tv stations to choose from there was no aids muslim terrorists road rage 911 bird flu freeway snipers etc etc the vietnam war was just over there will still be 7 years before star wars comes out the personal computer and internet would still be 29 years away br br when this movie first came out the producers had to market the film themselves as no other film company wanted it so it began touring small protestant churches around the country being shown on movie projectors this was the days before vcrs of course the pastor of a church who would would be interested in showing a thief in the night to his congregation would obtain a copy of the film then he would set up a evening to show it in the church meeting area or lunch room members of the congregation would invite unsaved friends and family members and it would be a social event of the week br br if you can get past the limited production values of the film and just watch it for its nostalgic value then i think you will enjoy the film more of course i am speaking as a gen xer br br if i had a time machine i would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century cesspool we have now
<START> how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad scary and life affirming it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen even though you were hoping maybe even beleiving it wouldn't br br utlimately this is the film's greatest strength it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations then drops a bomb on you br br i saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the mid '90s it is not easy to find but is definitely worth hunting for
<START> note to all directors long is not necessarily good this movie is incredibly long however not good the scenes were drawn out way way way way way too long the sex scenes were unnecessary and often too long the movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional but alas it became so boringly long that i can only give it a 2 of 10 it is way below average br br some other problems also exist in this marathon br br 1 ralph fiennes plays a whole family tree the guy who played the great grandfather looks nothing like him but the grandfather father and the son who gives us constant unneeded voice over are all ralph fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull headed personality no one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last even though photos of them are being snapped at every turn this one is minor but if the movie hadn't been 3 weeks long it wouldn't have been so annoying br br 2 the fact that no news from germany was even whispered for the longest time about jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed the uncle in france would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave br br 3 the love stories in this movie are totally wrong you are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short suddenly people are in love and almost instantly married then having children then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships this again would not have stuck out so much in a 2 hour movie but with time spent nothing was given to us br br 4 the ending was just bad i don't want to spoil it for anyone but you won't like it either unless you are sadistic br br the director writer should be tortured with having to watch this bloated garbage on a weekly basis i mean endless loop oops they are the same thing br br i wonder if robert redford did anything for this movie i mean i think istvan szabo must be modeling his directing career after him long drawn out movie which totally ruins any substance in the movie a short description of 'the horse whisperer' and sunshine br br sunshine perfect title if you start watching while the sun is shining it will quite possibly be well after dark when you leave
<START> for long time i haven't seen such a good fantasy movie magic fights here are even better than in lotr even considering that it's a 1987 movie and haven't computer special effects this movie have good plot good acting and interesting ideas recommend everybody to see it
<START> this agonizing comedy drama got surprisingly sterling reviews upon its release in 1979 i remember opening the movie section of the l a times and looking at a 2 page advertisement for chapter two filled with glowing captions like better than 'the goodbye girl' and neil simon does it again what does neil simon do he takes an autobiographical situation remarrying too soon after the death of a beloved spouse and makes it rusty unpleasant and worst of all unfunny james caan plays neil er that is george a writer who can't seem to get back into life after losing his wife enter spirited marsha mason real life mrs simon soon to be ex mrs simon who attempts to love george despite his moods and general melancholy mason is very appealing here and might've saved the day were it not for caan's indifference not to mention a sub plot concerning painfully thin blonde valerie harper which brings the proceedings to a screeching halt i liked mason's outburst at the end i am wonderful i am nuts about me but i saw no happy ending for these two people and time proved me right from
<START> okay let me break it down for you guys it's horrible br br if roger kumble did such a fancy job on the first cruel intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this i'm sorry but this movie is stupid true it may have improved if its series was ever aired but lets be realistic this movie a crock a lot of bad acting note the shower scene kissing cousins what kind of line is that slipery when wet can we say duh m this movie had effort i'll give you that but it was too stupid they even tried to make it funny by giving the house servants stupid accents which actually wasn't funny it was pathetic not to mention that they made everyone in the this one look absolutely nothing like the original cast it's as if they made them look different on purpose or something i like watching it when i'm really really really board which doesn't happen occasionally for those of you who did like it okay what were you thinking could you possibly choose this movie over the other one which had great acting and the fabulous sarah michelle gellar a movie is gold if it has sarah michelle gellar in it duh but this movie doesn't no offense amy adams oh yeah since when does sebastain have a heart ugh
<START> spoilers within br br it appears that von trotta was a lot more at ease with what the balance of personal story versus history of the events than she was in her earlier film versprechen das 1995 br br the direction seemed carefully controlled and visually i felt it was highly appealing especially where the visual narrative was concerned the title sequence blend and the lighting of a new candle in modern times commemorating the deaths of various characters in the past br br to clarify two points that many people have been confused by br br firstly lena did not sleep with goebbels although this may have seemed implied it was not the intent von trotta told me so herself and she is a very nice lady by the way br br secondly the time frame of events was in fact historically accurate the actual dates are shown on the close up of the memorial and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the film there is evidence showing that goebbels was annoyed about having done this and had planned to eventually recapture those he had set free br br overall what most impressed me most was that it was an original story from a much 'over movied' era it seems a shame that it has taken such a long time for various reasons for this film to hit our screens br br more of the same please margarethe
<START> i was hooked from beginning to end great horror comes from disturbing imagery and organic shocks that are created not to make you jump but to make you go what the f ck did i just see all the other commentators gave short summaries of what the film is about so i won't rehash what has already been said i was telling other people about this movie days after i had seen it just because it still haunted me i even had a bad dream after seeing it and i am a true horror fan not easily spooked by tripe like the grudge or even silent hill what gave me the bad dreams was the unease i felt about what i would do if i were in that cell with those guys what would my personal horror be my subconscious took me there and it was not pleasant that my friends is what a good horror flick does to you the best part of this movie is that it is subtle it's not about bogeymen that jump out at you alien invasions or tons of gore it's the opposite the horror you create in your own mind the irony for the four characters is that the horror comes not from an external force that asserts it's power over them simply the men ask for the one thing they desire and they get it but not in the way they imagined so on the one hand they get what they wish for from an occult book but may ultimately wish they hadn't sometimes being locked in a jail cell is the best place to be
<START> i saw this film at a store in the cheap section i actually vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailer for it years ago i thought what the hey' and bought it basically because the plot sounded interesting and claire danes has always been someone of talent in my eyes this was also before i became a huge kate beckinsale fan br br so it's about two girls who sneak off to a vacation in bangkok get busted for narcotics which they are innocent of and then are sent to a thailand prison the film follows what will happen to them and at times questions their innocence br br both claire danes and kate beckinsale give great performances and the plot of this film wraps itself up unconventionally and raises some nice moral discussion questions br br i think this is a solid good film but there could have been some improvements it could have been longer it would've helped to solidify these characters and more insight into the politics of thailand's justice system would've helped br br nevertheless other than that it's a good film with some great performances br br p s for all you pop culture junkies be on the lookout for a two minute role by paul walker i didn't even notice him the first time i saw the film
<START> dark remains is a low budget american horror movie that somehow managed to win 2 awards br br the plot seems to involve 2 separate strands first a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing second the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed the grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains it later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted br br as the movie goes on the 2 separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect however the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings unfortunately the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once br br just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong and fast and the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found here br br i believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the actors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor br br the characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site the badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue without creating opportunities for character driven situations and without adding depth to any of them br br the direction is uninspired the inspiration from j horror movies such as ringu the grudge and one missed call is evident unfortunately the directors of dark remains did not pay close attention to the style of j horror j horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation a ghost on a cctv camera walking towards it for example and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning there is no humour or tongue in cheek element in these movies everything is played so straight and without remorse or limitations that you can't help but be convinced and captivated by it the foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact very much unlike the jump scares used in hollywood movies br br the directors of dark remains made a brave attempt to avoid hollywood clichÃ©s and also successfully avoided using cgi the homage to j horror could have been well intended unfortunately the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed scares on the screen the make up effects of the ghosts weren't too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic i was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie br br i couldn't give away the ending even if i wanted to i simply couldn't understand it all i could deduce was that it was something of an anti climax br br what remains the answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom the movie is a chore to sit through thankfully the pain ends after an hour and a half however most would probably switch off long before the end br br there are only 2 positive things i could find in this movie the successful avoidance of scare clichÃ©s and the absence of the f word in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find this is what the 2 stars are for br br those who like supernatural or psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as the legend of hell house the changeling or the j horror sub genre br br if you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultra low budget r rated horror movie about ghosts watch death of a ghost hunter it may not be the greatest horror movie ever made but it is surely a lot better than dark remains and does have a few genuine surprises in store br br i advise everyone to avoid dark remains like the plague
<START> this is probably one of brian de palma's best known movies but it isn't his best body double the fury and carrie are better movies but this movie is better than blow out and obsession de palma is very influenced by hitchcock and this movie is a take off on psycho angie dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking of having an affair and after her psychiatrist played by michael caine turns down an offer dickinson meets a man in a art gallery and she winds up sleeping with him after this point it's best you don't know what happens but there is a murder and nancy allen is a call girl who gets a look at the killer dennis franz is the detective on the case who really doesn't trust allen and she has to find the killer herself it's a pretty good movie but isn't one of de palma's best
<START> lost is one of a kind its so enchanting and full of suspense thrill and emotions all at the same time i have never seen any tv series like this before it is full of jungle thrills and has a good screenplay the actors have emoted life on an island in such a natural way that i feel lost in the island myself while watching it it is an excellent piece of work narrated in a very intelligent form the series is like a movie depicting the life of the survivors lost on a deserted island i am tempted to watch one episode after the other and i highly recommend this series for all the tv show lovers watch it to see the magic of being lost in nowhere
