<START> i've always thought that most huge box office flops usually have something to recommend them but after the remake of around the world in 80 days and thunderbirds i'm beginning to doubt it for those not familiar it's based on a puppet show about a family of astronauts who use state of the art rockets spaceships and subs to rescue people from various disasters falling bridges stricken planes burning buildings etc each week well the puppets are gone replaced by far more lifeless teenagers and so is the premise only one ineptly staged rescue and a plot shamelessly ripped off from spy kids without any signs of imagination wit or entertainment young alan tracey feels left out of all the rescuing we never see the other traceys do because dad won't let him play with a real rocket until he passes his exams grounded on a beautiful tropical island some punishment his chance to shine comes when the rest of the family a bunch of identikit bleach blondes who look like a gay neo nazi boy band without a single bit of characterisation between them are stranded in space and he has to have the day by er running around the jungle making a phone call firing a hose at the inept comedy relief villains and dousing them in gunk for bad measure br br the good points are few and far between one of them is that the film is mostly in focus the other is they all got to go to the seychelles which looks nice br br the bad points where to start ben kingsley's career lowpoint performance the aforementioned inept comedy relief sidekicks who would disgrace the children's film foundation at its worst the almost complete lack of action or effects in a 70m sci fi film the terrible script the lifeless direction the odious moralising but most of all is the fact that the film is so patronising in every possible way forget the life lessons and off the peg sentiment this is a movie aimed straight at the under eights by people who know they're making a kid's movie and are constantly talking down to their intended audience throwing in fifth rate jokes and routines that would insult most children who had only recently mastered the art of speech this film could replace being sent to bed early without their dinner as parents' favourite punishment for kids br br the biggest flop in british film history it didn't even cover the cost of prints and marketing it's just about watchable if only as an object lesson in how not to make a summer movie
<START> br br filmed just after the war this story was made in order to highlight anglo american relations after the war it ended up receiving the honour of being the first royal premiere after wwii br br remarkably the film tangles together the royal air force sigmund freud psychology the founding fathers of america and various others up the long stairs special effects in its infancy and beyond the heavenly gates without losing any of its integrity br br although sounding absurd this clever script leads and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and a presents a charming ease rarely matched in cinema since br br be prepared to have your heart warmed by this sweet innocent and charming love story roger livesey acts like a man possessed to steal the show br br british cinema should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post war years br br
<START> the movie was sub par but this television pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a sci fi fans ideal program the actors deliver and the special effects for a television series are spectacular having an intelligent interesting script doesn't hurt either br br stargate sg1 is currently one of my favorite programs
<START> if this film strikes you as it did us and apparently others departing the theater as disappointingly thin it may be because the subject herself is mildly disappointing the film faithfully presents us bettie page as she probably was a playful almost innocent from the rural south whose career as the pinup queen of the universe was for her just goofy natural fun her eventual moral qualms religious conversion and sudden departure from nude and bondage modeling are biographically accurate yet hard to understand given how untroubled she seemed by her livelihood br br there are many reasons to see this film even so not least of which are the amazing b w noir cinematography of w mott hopfel iii complete with old fashioned wipes and dissolves the 1950's faithful acting of the cast under the direction of mary harron pitch perfect performances by some of our most underrated supporting actors including chris bauer lili taylor sarah paulson austin pendleton dallas roberts and victor slezak not to mention the oscar worthy and technically difficult lead performance of gretchen mol br br ms mol does several scenes fully naked and most others in amazing period lingerie and specialty costumes gloriously assembled by costume designer john a dunn yet she astonishingly maintains bettie page's unstudied pleasure in her lush body to watch ms mol as ms page an aspiring actress progressing through degrees of progressively less bad auditions and student acting scenes is to see a truly fine actress in complete control of her craft br br the script does effectively bring us into 1950's america where childhood sexual abuse lawless abduction and rape and the legal suppression of brands of pornography which today seem laughably tame is a reality 50's new york is evoked with seamlessly inter cut news reel footage 50's miami comes alive in super saturated 16mm style color the real bettie page seems to scamper smile and pose before us and yet the effect is curiously lightweight barely lewd and not at all dangerous br br how odd that bondage's greatest icon should be so lacking in venom and that this technically excellent biopic should have so little sting
<START> a common plotline in films consists of the main characters leaving the hustle and bustle of the city behind and finding themselves in the tranquility of nature in power of kangwon province we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular korean parks in the mountains of kangwon province however rather than epiphanal moments we have two characters whose trip into nature was just another form of escape br br the pace of this movie is slow contemplative we learn in the end what really brought each to kangwon province and we learn how they're connected for those who want hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer this movie will not satisfy but for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking wondering affecting them years after this movie will more than satiate that longing
<START> this is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it it has lot's of laughs guns action crime good one liners and a decent plot with an over the top donald sutherland in a rather comedic role as an assasain tia carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act too thomas ian griffin is great in this as the lead character max a dea agent diane is the fbi agent played by carerra and john lithgow from frazier on tv plays the bad guy livingston the plot centers around max and diane trying to capture livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies throw into the mix the assassain sutherland who pretty much has all the good one liners this is the perfect crime caper there is the usual love story but played very differently than you would think by carerra and griffith you also have the russian mafia italian mafia and chineese mafia here thrown into the mix the film is shot in boston where you have some great shots and locals great photography and music in this film this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy it has everything that one could ever want check out sutherland's toilet in a particular scene very unusual this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me
<START> well the artyfartyrati of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid if you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you a large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have simply a little distasteful and pointless the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot the plot however has little to recommend a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano which might appeal to some people but lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth not recommended
<START> once in a while in indian cinema there comes along a movie like sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie and den just once in a while hopefully we have a rgv ki aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own a standard so low it can never be broken ram gopal varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish so stale u can smell it from a distance to take a classic like sholay and assassinate it is totally unforgivable and i can't believe he almost called the movie rgv ki sholay although sholay had a lot of folklore elements in it the movie managed to build on its plot by merely defining the characters so distinctively that they lived on forever what aag does is take these characters and mess them up so badly u'll need a contest to pick the worst the realism element is totally missing and what the movie ends up providing is a bunch of actors parading along in a plot less and seemingly unrelated set of events one star for this film is a ridiculous waste of a vote its time for rgv to wake up to the reality of his failure and conjure up another different plot that can be categorized under cinema
<START> i am ashamed to have this movie in my collection the most redeeming factor to owning the dvd is the short film in the bonus features my vote for this movie is a big fat zero don't misunderstand i'm a horror girl but i want some meat behind the story not to mention i prefer the evil to happen to humans not to be tricked in to watching what seemed like forever clips of animal snuff acts of brutality interrupt achingly long silence and poor acting if i was forced to make a comparison to another film the only one that comes to mind is cannibal holocaust bad boring pointless and a wholly uncomfortable watch
<START> the movie is absolutely silly br br but were you expecting a high brow intellectual film based on a comic called slam dunk really jay chou's acting isn't exactly the most moving thing i've ever seen but i certainly enjoyed the movie was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like jet li or stephen chow can produce no not really was it thoroughly entertaining if you're just taking it at surface value absolutely it's a movie about some chinese eye candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise there's an evil triad style dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets jay chou involved in all of this a love interest it's formulaic but really suspend disbelief for a while come on it's called kung fu dunk what do you really think you signed on for do yourself a favor if you watch it i found myself a copy with some engrish subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise but we got a great laugh out of it they would appear to be extremely fixated on jerusalem and the numbers 1 10 br br i laughed i cried i hurled i'd watch it again br br especially for that fight scene in the bar well choreographed and well shot i especially enjoy the plexiglass lit pool table i'd love to play on one of those br br slick enough for me but i dig on trash cinema
<START> moon child was one of the more symbolic movies i've seen what i really liked about it was the illustration on immorality mortality and the obstacles and guidances through life the movie depicts a great deal of vampire kei having the power of immorality and the advantages to it whether if it is having supernatural abilities or everlasting life these are what humans usually wish for moon child shows the pain and disadvantages of being immortal since the feelings towards loss impacts almost all the characters especially to the main characters sho and kei the meaning of the title 'moon child' reveals as the film comes close to the end where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon which shines other people's way giving guidance i personality quite like that moral the movie depicted on the weaknesses of the film lies in some parts of the acting and special effects since it made the film less authentic the scene where character toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions in the acting were put into it some scenes with special effects like the gun shots also could have been more authentic without making it seem too much like an action video game the sparks that came out of the guns appeared too fake and i think that could have been eliminated or fixed nevertheless i think moon child should be a movie everyone should consider watching the symbolic ideas and images the movie brings out would be easily accepted by everyone and may interest many viewers it is quite a thoughtful film and also entertaining to watch
<START> ok anyone who could honestly say that this movie was great or even good is either delusional or knows the director writer and producers and is trying to boost the buzz on this film i watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was horrible i'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie bored me to tears the reason i'm being so harsh is because this film was clearly a different take on of mice and men and they should sue because it is such a horrible rip off of the story in an industry where hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt for someone to take a classic book and film of mice and men and destroy it with a new spin bugs me so much the actors the accents the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dismal i mean if your going to take a new spin on an existing story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified did not like this movie at all
<START> having read the reviews for this film i understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good however this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time the majority of reviews that i had read said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow and whilst some parts do leave you confused the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you've missed so much it's not like lock stock or snatch in the sense that it isn't that funny in fact it's pretty dark and it is a lot more intelligent in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints and in one of the best scenes of the film jason statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself the way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned is that it is full of memorable characters specifically statham who gives a fantastic performance as the lead and ray liotta who spends most of the film in speedos but gives a great performance none the less if you've got time and have time afterwards to think about the film and even watch it again you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film i think it's fantastic and that guy ritchie is a director on top of his game
<START> incredibly muddled off putting and ultimately ludicrous the horses oh my god the horses thriller it's creepy at times but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody magically does exactly what the plot needs for the resolution to occur bland performances by the leads a typically eccentric one by richard lynch the video transfer is a real hack job cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand 0 out of 4 stars
<START> my expectations were quite high for this film everyone i know who saw this film at the cinema told me that everyone there stayed through the credits because they were so touched my expectations could not have been any higher anything short of wonderful would have disappointed me br br i was anything but disappointed by this movie i loved how it dealt with difficult subjects without going through the usual steps a hollywood film tends to include in this film characters worked through problems they had had for decades they worked through prejudicm they learned to open up but it did not come easily and not just by singing a song or two it was painful it took arguments it took confrontations it felt like real life br br one scene that really stuck out to me was the scene in which gabriella sings her song helen sjÃ¶holm is one of my favorite singers her voice is lovely and you could tell that she was not just lip syncing to a previous recording during filming which i often find in other movies she really sang with her whole body and soul you could feel what gabriella was feeling in that scene had this movie been made in hollywood her song would most likely have been sung toward the end and it would have made her husband open his eyes and see the error of his ways as well as making the other people in the village realise a thing or two instead it came halfway through and it did not bring any solutions her husband did not become overwhelmed and realise what he's putting her through and it didn't seem to make anyone else in the village more open minded it was beautiful it was pure and it was touching but it did not magically solve all her problems that felt real to me that's probably what would have happened in real life the whole movie felt like real life to me nothing neatly wrapped up but everything with a sense of joy and happiness you rarely find a movie which feels so realistic br br there were a few things that bothered me but hey no movie is perfect if you haven't already you should go see as it is in heaven and be filled with a joy for life a sense of hope and the feeling that you've been touched on a level movies rarely reach you will be sad pained happy and a dozen other emotions br br someone once said that if every person in the world sang in a choir there would be no more wars having seen this film i might have to agree
<START> if is the cinematic equivalent of sgt pepper's revered by baby boomers as the pinnacle of creation and viewed as rather a silly bit of business by preceding and subsequent generations now that the children of the middle classes the world over are seemingly super human due to the internet and view the prospect of boarding school as a wonderful opportunity thanks to the harry potter books films the relevance of if couldn't be further from modern concern in fact many scenes appear so alien and exaggerated as to hint at an inspiration for pink floyd's the wall br br one should never hold personal bias against a film while reviewing and the cemented date of this film aside there are a few flaws which others have overlooked lindsay anderson was known to be a fan of luis buÃ±uel on top of generally being too smart for his own good and despite a straightforward narrative through the first and second acts the latter portion of the piece it taken hostage by cod buÃ±uel surrealism and strained attempts at symbolism anderson wasn't capable of this feat due to his over intelligent cynicism failing to see that buÃ±uel was jovial in his work i have not found a critic whom champions the 'chaplain in a drawer' and am almost certain it still gets sideways looks from those who adore this film the ending is not so much a concise punch to the established class values system as a wet slap on a moving target br br the british public school system was firmly for the middle classes the upper crust being educated at home by private tutors and the modus operandi of if was to check the boxes of public school life which lindsay believed had been unexplored in film thereby savaging middle class pretense homosexuality generational cutlery cold showers et al in reality such issues had been covered in many other great british films if merely brought them to the fore the browning version was a more oblique damning of such pomp to name but one br br if is oddly quaint and simply can not be viewed with modern especially american eyes kudos to anderson for avoiding mick and kieth in favour of african chant and a few brownie points for the latent homoerotic overtones points deducted for pretension establishing characters who disappear and inciting a glib revolution which came to naught
<START> yes it was a little low budget but this movie shows love the only bad things about it was that you can tell the budget on this film would not compare to waterworld and though the plot was good the film never really tapped into it's full potential strong performances from everyone and the suspense makes it worthwhile to watch on a rainy night
<START> what was this supposed to be a remake of fisher king why do we care about sandler's character what a slow dreary boring who gives a damn about these people movie just simply painful to sit through i turned it off before it was over it's so obvious that cheadle needs help as much as sandler like i said can you say fisher king and how does this psychotic character function in his daily life we aren't supposed to think that deeply i guess why does cheadle continue to give sandler a chance to turn violent on him if they were such good friends how did they grow apart if cheadle is so in control why does he keep seeking the advice of the shrink on the street we are never told that's why fisher king was a better film on so many levels and why this just sucks nearly 8 out of 10 average score i don't agree at all even the top films are lucky to get such a high average rating and this crap doesn't deserve to be in the same universe with them
<START> ok forget all the technical inconsisties or the physical impossibilities of the space shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold forget the hideous special effects and poorly constructed one dimensional characters just looking at the premise of the story the very reason for the film to exist in the first place and you will see just how badly this film was pieced together br br i know 9 year olds that look at this insult to the intelligence and just laugh at it the story is horrible the acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible and whats worse is that the cable movie channels keep showing it its on twice a day every two or three days why does anyone in their right mind think that people would want to see this painful piece of celluloid multiple times much less to see it at all br br my recomendation is dont even bother spending the energy to watch this thing its just not worth it
<START> terminus paradis was exceptional but niki ardelean comes too late we already have enough of this and we want something new br br big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time not behind why people see romania only as a postrevolutionary country br br we are just born not reincarnated and nobody gives a s t anymore about old times most people dont remember or dont want to remember and the new generation of movie consumers dont understand a bit this should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song priveghi maybe younger directors should make the move
