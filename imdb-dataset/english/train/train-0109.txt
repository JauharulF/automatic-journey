<START> i can give you four reasons to see this movie br br 1 four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary mexican cinema br br 2 four good stories related into a big scheme br br 3 a surprisingly good cast br br 4 a bitter reflexion about the biggest trouble in this country and many others br br possible spoilers br br alejandro gamboa opens this movie with a good story in a comedic mood about the authority practicing the extortion against regular people and still expecting to be appreciated by its efforts br br then antonio serrano gets more dramatic in the second piece with a story heir to the italian neorealism with a peter and the wolf like anecdote br br in the third story the one that seems more independent from this series even in the context carlos carrera tells us the story of a man being at the wrong place in the wrong moment but after the recent lynching at tlahuac and the tradition in this awful matter at the state of mexico this story couldn't be more updated br br and at the end fernando sariÃ±ana returns to the dark humor in the grand finale in which he puts together the most of the characters from the past sequences in one of the better comedy pieces ever filmed reprising the center scene from one of his previous films todo el poder sariÃ±ana gives the final lesson of the theme and by the way give us the scene that steals the movie with anna ciochetti making a brief striptease br br once the movie has ended you get a bittersweet feeling about having looked at a good movie and maybe enjoyed it with a very painful subject they say that in mexico people laugh at their own disgrace and this is the best example this film is a testimony of how mexicans have learn to live in the middle of a crime state and perhaps accepted it between two fires the criminals and the so called authorities full of corruption even this movie is a wishful thinking because almost all the good people have been a victim of crime and they don't get this unhurt if you had an assault without a scratch then you're lucky meanwhile don't lose the chance to see this movie highly recommended br br and it's a beautiful life in mexico
<START> fear of a black hat is a superbly crafted film i was laughing almost continuously from start to finish if you have the means i highly recommend viewing this movie it is by far the funniest movie i have had the pleasure to experience grab your stuff
<START> this is what i call a great movie it lives trough the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic but the main theme is very cruel like live is the bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country jugoslavia on their way to the capital belgrad the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way connect the people and the pigs that travel together br br watch it and you gonna remember it for life its filled with slavic humor and lifestyle br br and another reason for its magic it is hard to get
<START> i thought this movie was stunning with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi artemisia gentileschi br br cervi portrays artemisia so beautifully with tentative yet confidant mannerisms her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch br br although not each character was overtly beautiful this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time br br overall i thought this film was fantastic
<START> i was china in this film i choose the screen name sheeba alahani because i was modeling at the time in italy and they couldn't pronounce my real name correctly so i choose sheeba and then added alahani since it was similar to alohalani br br i had never acted before and it shows but it was so much fun to film they gave me acting lessons each morning which obviously were not useful they dubbed my voice thank goodness br br david and peter were a blast on the set full of good humor and jokes this film was never meant to be taken seriously it was a tax write off according to inside information br br i give it a 1 because i have a sense of humor but a 10 for the fun i had acting in it
<START> i found the pace to be glacial and the original story blown way out of proportion to the content my wife slept through most of it and i did not try to wake her because i felt she was not missing anything br br when holmes and watson enter the house and then are potentially caught it is unclear how they could hide all of their entry and burglary tools so quickly it is also unclear how the door to the study is locked preventing the servants from getting in br br the thing that puzzled me was right at the end when there was a glint in the eye of the broken statute i have no clue what this was supposed to represent
<START> major spoilers this is for people who have seen the movie br br commenters have touched on the major theme of honor in the film and too many comparisons to braveheart i'll point out a few things about this movie that i have not seen other comments touch on br br this movie has a decidedly different take on abortion the first character to get pregnant is the villain's roth girlfriend and when he coldly suggests an abortion she states it is too late for that the shame of her situation i'm to have a bastard's bastard leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene the second character to find herself pregnant is mary rob's wife after a rape by roth's character and at least one sex scene with her husband rob late in the movie as rob is leaving for a final confrontation with roth mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins with a tone hinting of abortion rob replies in a noble tone it's not the fault of the child and then states what he thinks the name should be girl or boy i find this pro life stance on the part of the hero to be very un hollywood rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment not coincidental symbolism br br another related theme is roth's character is a bastard someone who evidently does not know who his father was and has few kind words for his mother though he wears a picture of her in a case hung from his neck is it coincidence that roth devoid of family stability is the walking definition of psychopath while rob is the strong husband father figure and of course the hero in the final sword fight between rob and the villain roth the former slices the latter deeply across the chest the left side of the chest over the heart his employer and pseudo father figure john hurt character holds the mother's picture in his hand and gazes at it before snatching it from the neck of the dead roth br br also what i find interesting was the direction of the rape scene which was not quite graphic but neither was it off camera and implied i found it surprising in it's somewhat matter of fact depiction with mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal and subsequent post traumatic stress as we call it now my point being that the rape was neither sensationalized nor just implied which i find an interesting middle road for hollywood to take br br in the final fight scene i have to correct an earlier commenter the weapon roth chose was a rapier or perhaps a short sword the weapon rob chose was a claymore someone was really doing their homework on this entire scene roth would have the upper hand in such a situation but of course the claymore is a distinctly scottish weapon what is even more striking to me as a fencer and someone who has read a bit on the subject is that this final sword fight is one of the most convincing of any film ever made the actors seem actually trying to kill each other not the usual slashes to the opponents blade we see in most movie fights including the movies opening fight even more true to history roth is seen several times using the rapier as a thrusting weapon which is it's purpose by design rapiers were edged but primarily a thrusting weapon with the edges used mainly for parrying an opponents thrust rob uses the claymore in broad slashes as it's design intent the fight goes down as i would expect it to roth effectively wins though rob wins the day by grabbing roth's weapon more symbolism and striking him dead with a powerful slashing cut br br folks it is rare to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fight br br i'll also note that for whatever reason i remember 1995 the year of release distinctly as a time of distrust of the u s government hollywood was obviously tuned into that with the release of both rob roy and braveheart and i think the anti government leanings are why both films get so much comparison br br i think the different perspective that this film gives is refreshing to avid movie fans tired of the same old not so hidden messages from hollywood
<START> i was but a babe in arms when george lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world saga chronicling the adventures of young luke skywalker and the notorious darth vadar but even today 20 years on i can appreciate the genius that is lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with in a new hope lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky princess leia the rougish han solo and the spirited luke skywalker as well as that best loved of villains the sinister darth vadar in the empire strikes back he went all out to show us special effects can add to a tale and managed to something no one thought you could do on screen he made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat return of the jedi is a fitting end to a saga that will stand the test of time br br when the empire srtikes back ended with encasing of the lovable rouge han solo in carbonite to be delivered to jabba the hut and young luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse vadar it seemed had won the day how we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow in lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from han's daring rescue from jabba's palace to the the final climactic battle on the death star between luke and vadar as luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his father's soul br br old friends like the smooth talking lando calrissian and the ever lovable chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the emperor himself played by the brilliant ian mcdiarmiud how he missed out on an oscar is a mystery desperate to turn luke to the dark side even if it means betraying his apprentice darth vadar all in black with his red eyes ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed master of the events that unfold his new and improved death star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the empire's reign for good br br lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted we watch in excitement as han and leia attempt to bring down the shield around the death star from the forest moon of endor with the help of some adorable ewoks who i really do not believe take from the movie at all in fact i feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the death star and hindered by legions of stormtroopers and imperial officers we cheer on lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty imperial fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the deatn star to destroy it once and for all and we watch with bated breath as vadar and the emperor attempt to turn luke to the dark side while he in turn tries to turn his father back br br but for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside darth vadar for rotj is a battle of emotions and feelings vadar is caught between his loyalty to the emporer and the empire and his fatherly inclinations to luke never did i think that a mask could show emotion but some how one can't but see the confusion and pain on vadar's face during the final scenes as the emporer turns on luke there is more depth and emotion to vadar than i believed a villain especially one more machine then man could have and that i think is what makes him so accessible he is conflicted the apprentice as much as the master the victim as much as the villain without ruining the end too much vadar's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy br br so in conclusion what can i say george lucas is the master of the saga star wars is the most compelling and engaging sagas i've seen in a long time and i have yet to see another saga rival it return of the jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending lucas masterpiece deserves it's action suspense romance tragedy redemption joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that lucas can be proud of
<START> if you came into the film with expectations throw them away now because no amount of hype will do this film justice br br to categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal it's a spy thriller has elements of noir bits and pieces of action science fiction and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative mind bending plot twists and gorgeous cinematography br br a lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative both in good and bad ways of other movies but as they say every story cribs from shakespeare so once you can get past that you're in for a hell of a ride br br you will need to suspend your disbelief at some points and while the set never becomes unbelievable there are portions read the elevator which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals don't misconstrue that to mean it's on the same level as cheesy sci fi channel movies though because this is on a much higher level br br if you're looking for action you should turn away this is pure psychology but if you're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience by all means do it now watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it
<START> i first saw this when it premiered more than ten years ago i saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me she fought alone is about a girl caitlin played by tiffani thiessen who is raped by jace played by david lipper a classmate who enjoys hurting girls caitlin is in a popular high school clique but when she reveals she is raped the clique turns against her led by ethan played by brian austin green br br this movie chronicles caitlin's struggle against an entire town including a high school that essentially lets athletes determine the social environment allowing them to get away with whatever they wish br br thiessen and green are the top performers and there is real chemistry between the two of the them throughout the entire film all of the actors in this film which was inspired by actual events did a great job she fought alone really captures the essence of what it is like to be in high school at least in 1995 and having one's self esteem and reputation at stake recommended 10 10
<START> an executive very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life meets a boy with down syndrome escaped from a residence both characters feel very alone and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life with this argument the somehow amelie like atmosphere and the sentimental music i didn't expect but a moralistic disgusting movie anyway as there were some interesting scenes the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy and the interpretation of both actors daniel auteil and pasqal duquenne was very good i decided to go on watching the movie the french cinema in general has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life opposed to the more stereotyped american cinema but because of that it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending with the impossible death of the boy the charming tone the happiness of the executive's family the cheap moral the unbearable laughter of the daughters the guy waving from heaven as michael landon really nasty in my humble opinion
<START> i thought hugh o'conor was astounding as the young christy brown and really deserved greater recognition for his role i couldn't believe how well he played the part of course daniel day lewis was brilliant too my favourite scene is where the boys are playing football and christy uses his head to stop the goals and then kicks the penalty amazing performances by the two christys and other also
<START> br br everything is relative seems to be the main theme from the outset by this set of eleven pieces by eleven directors that is to say that what might be number one priority for people like bush blair and company may not be so for a great many other people ordinary people from the opening scene in which an iranian teacher is trying to impress on her little students the most important thing that has happened with the result the children are not impressed as the death of a neighbour and things like that evidently affect them much more closely than anything which may have happened in new york usa wherever that is this series of almost documentary styled pieces establishes that not all things are as equal unto all men as some world leaders would try to prophess br br whereas obviously the attack on the wtc was a dastardly event by any yardstick one does get the impression that both politicians and tv cameramen tend to blow up things out of all proportion wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces would the same reaction at international level have occurred if the attack had been made on lagos say or djakarta say or even on rio de janeiro say i rather think not news seems to suffer distortion depending on where things happen much more tv time is given to an earthquake in italy say than one ten times more destructive in outer mongolia say greater distances seem to decrease the magnitude of the disaster br br this series of eleven pieces helps to put things in better perspective or perhaps i should say some of the pieces do as each director with complete freedom has made up his own story his own translated perspective such that it is not possible to judge the whole merits but individually for each eleven minute segment br br in no way should one deduce that this is an anti american film that would be a too simple reading of the diverse messages manifested through the segments however it is not pro american either the eleven segments adopt varied attitudes and the common link if there is one is that the disaster of the wtc attack has to be seen in perspective from different view points only then will such people as george bush even begin to comprehend the planet he is living on br br clearly stated in one segment is a belief of mine i have been harbouring for two years now america has not learnt the lesson and the lesson is that the usa has to share this planet with the rest of humanity not dominate it by ruthless economical persuasion or just plain force instead of learning that the usa cannot continue just stamping all over everybody and everywhere its political leaders aided and abetted by blair and even aznar have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant which is not doing any good to anyone in afghanistan or irak at present let alone much elsewhere the white house mentality is totally rejectable the us and uk invaded irak and caused all the chaos and so should clear up the mess they caused not insist on the un and other nations to delve in with a helping hand and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil br br radical stances adopted by the us or even israel is only going to be met by radical stances from islamic people who for years have been gearing up fanatical fundamentalism if only to cover up their own macho uselessness i e stoning women to death or simply shrouding them from the tops of their heads to the dusty ground br br the world is in a terrible mess fueled by the greed of a few rich countries who seem bent on not seeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives this film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dismal and dumb posture
<START> eyeliner was worn nearly 6000 years ago in egypt really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the 12th century i also didn't realize the series flopped there is a second season airing now isn't there it is amazing to me when commentaries are made by those who are either ill informed or don't watch a show at all it is a waste of space on the boards and of other's time the first show of the series was maybe a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place but that is to be expected from any show the remainder of the first season is excellent i can hardly wait for the second season to begin in the united states
<START> ahh this film had so much potential a good cast of quality b actors the thighs of jessica simpson and that is about it br br i believe some guy in some unnamed marketing department had an idea basically lets do a kind of legally blond film but do it in new york that big bright city of chances power and money and where everyone is a heartless power money hungry person let's add to this jessica simpson small town bimbo that brother of owen wilson and for some no apparent reason andy dick only because of him you should ignore this film br br basic story line br br boy leaves girl for ny girl follows boy cheats girl stays in ny with cousin gets a job under false pretenses mucks up is courted by other boy brother wilson and together save the day and kiss br br a few words come to mind when reflecting upon this film i e dire awful unbearable intolerable and xenophobic br br just don't watch this film you will be happier one reviewer referred to guantanamo and i definitely agree with him this film induces shock and i know what you are thinking at least at some point will i see simpson naked or close too it's not gonna happen spare yourself the time and youtube her you will have better sexy time br br the films editing is flimsy the acting is unbearable and why do they use blue screens br br in conclusion this is cinematic treason which should be punished to the maximum br br another question why does willie nelson always play a kind of father figure in almost every jessica simpson flick and why are there no black latin asian or european people in this movie
<START> earth 2009 1 2 big screen adaptation of the bbc discovery channel series planet earth offers quite a majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some truly jaw dropping moments of how the hell did they get this footage while taking in the awesome scenics of animals in their natural habitats and environmental message of the circle of life can be cruel witness a great white shark gulping down a walrus seal as a quick meal and adorable the various babies and their 'rents the basso profundo tones of narrator james earl jones solidifies its 'god's eye views' and profundity culled from literally hundreds of hours of footage the only gripe comes from the fact this should have been in the imax format and could've even gone longer oh well there's always the next time since disney studios has produced this count on a series of more to come dirs alastair fothergill mark linfield
<START> jeopardy is a tense satisying thriller a cut above a b but not really a major production it qualifies as almost an experimental film as the studio that produced it metro was desperately looking for new kinds of films stars and directors to compete with the then new medium of television the director john sturges was an up and comer whose best years lay ahead he had just recently begun directing a level films and had already proved himself a most capable craftsman stars barbara stanwyck barry sullivan and ralph meeker were at very different phases of their careers stanwyck's glory years were behind her and yet she could still carry a film as she proves here barry sullivan as her husband was one of a dozen or so leading men who got started in films in the forties who never quite achieved the success many had hoped for him he was a fine low key actor poised but in an upper middle rather than upper class way which made him excellent in professional roles as the escaped convict who is the only person around who can save sullivan's life he is trapped under a pier and the tide is rising ralph meeker is more energetic than usual this excellent actor had the misfortune of having come to films after brando and clift he was in his way as good an actor as either of them but he lacked charisma his bargaining with stanwyck which comes down to his demanding sex in exchange for saving her husband by implication only as this is 1953 makes for an intriguing premise which had this been a different kind of film could all raised all sorts of interesting questions about stanwyck's character meeker is indeed a more exciting character than sullivan and in her scenes with him stanwyck is livelier than she is with her husband and son but as this is a formula picture not a strindberg play the possibility that stanwyck might want want to have a fling leaving aside the question of her husband's predicament remains unexplored in this sense the incoming tide doesn't quite have the effect one might have wished though the movie remains tense and highly entertaining thanks to excellent acting fine location photography nearly all of it outdoors and excellent direction by the woefully underrated mr sturges
<START> barriers seems to be one of those series that have been lost in the mists of time after it's transmission in the early 80s and one repeat it's since sunk without trace this is a crying shame br br i originally watched this when it was transmitted in the southern tv region on sunday afternoons and was classic tea time viewing although i don't remember a great deal about the program a few things stuck in my mind most notable were the unforgettable titles the mournful flute music accompanying the attempted escape across an east european border and the subsequent car crash and that scene has left me with an abiding love of 'fintail' mercedes models as they used a merc 200 although it wasn't obvious at the start the solution to the series' mystery was in these titles br br the plot about a young music student trying to unravel what really happened when he discovers he was adopted had lots of twists and turns but barriers was a surprisingly 'adult' children's drama benedict taylor was excellent as billy and it was a shame he didn't do a lot more br br this was a quality drama well overdue for a dvd release and i hope i'll get the chance to re acquaint myself with it in the future br br a fond memory from my childhood
<START> the recent boom of dating show on u s television screens has reached a fevered pitch since the first episode of the bachelor unsuspecting audiences have since been subjected to countless clones and variations including the bachelorette joe millionaire for love or money and the execrable married by america hoping to cash in on this trend and simultaneously tap and exploit a new demographic bravo has unleashed the disastrous boy meets boy upon the world and may they have mercy on us all br br the premise is simple and is designed to be light hearted an eligible gay man is courted by a number of suitors eliminated show by show until one is left but there's a twist half of the men are actually straight this is not much of a big deal but the inherent viciousness of the scenario kicks in after hearing the pay off if at the end of the show the gay man picks a straight man in disguise the straight man wins a cash prize the gay man gets nothing or at least nothing more than a few parting gifts a pat on the back and a hearty round of aren't you embarrassed well thanks for playing br br just the like the equally painful queer eye for the straight guy another bravo program this show is another example of stereotypes run amok what makes it even worse though is the fact that straight men are playing up these stereotypes for cash the producers of this show believe that all you have to do is put enough hair gel in a man's hair dress up in abercrombie fitch with a pair of designer sandals strip him of all body hair and fat and voila it's the gay equivalent to putting a white performer in blackface and just as offensive to those of us like myself who are genuinely gay and don't dress act like that it implies that gays have no variance or chance for individuality that they can't behave like real people only like stereotypes never mind the fact that the bank of suitors is sorely lacking in any kind of diversity all are gym toned most are white and all look far too scrubbed and cleaned br br this is another example of how instead of fostering acceptance of gays as dynamic individuals capable of variance and change hollywood has again taken a stereotype and run with it all the way to the bank i feel genuinely dirty watching this show as show any gay man who sees this unabashed parade of soft core pornography masquerading as legitimate television 1 out of 10
<START> the video quality is awful the sound quality is pathetic the acting is horrific the dialog is painful the lighting is dismal the editing is laughable i could go on but it would be pointless snitch'd is a third rate amateur video being passed off as a feature film this one is best left to collect dust in the video store bargain bin
