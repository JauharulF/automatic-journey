<START> i turned this on to see the incredible ethel waters whose autobiography i am now reading i'll admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece it's pretty much a short film made by blacks for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time old trends exaggerated for humor we see modern black movies do the same thing but with the new trends stereotypes ho's and the hood and such i think if you look back in eighty years you would find today's movies will look just as racist what viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of waters and the pint sized sammy davis jr who out taps his contemporary shirley temple and looks remarkably the same facially as he did as an adult everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it why not enjoy it for what it is instead of what you think it should have been
<START> virgil manoven is an old man who lives alone in his remote rural farmhouse chasing his beloved cat one morning into the woods around his property manoven glimpses what looks like the murder of a young child in the middle of the woods he reports the crime to the police but there's no body to be found troubled by disturbing visions he investigates further and eventually is guided to a spooky orphanage where events take a supernatural turnÂ soft for digging is a fantastic experimental horror with lots of creepy atmosphere to spare this minimalist film is almost completely devoid of dialogue some scenes are genuinely nightmarish and the acting is excellent the location sets provide plenty of creepiness the eerie maryland woods rival those used in the blair witch projcect give this strange horror film a chance 9 out of 10
<START> all dog's go to heaven is an animated kid's movie like no other gambling drinking death guns and hell are all prominent in the plot and though kids will get very little of it adults will be scratching their heads as to why this movie was made to feel like some sort of gangster movie the actual movie isn't explicit in any way it's just an odd combination to make a kid's movie on br br charlie barkin burt reynolds is a player dog who owns half a casino with his partner carface vic tayback after getting drunk a dog getting drunk in a kid's movie it just sounds weird charlie is tricked and murdered by carfax when in heaven he finds a way to come back to earth but he will no longer be allowed in heaven he still goes back to earth and meets up with his old friend itchy dom deluise and plans payback on carfax meanwhile carfax has a little orphan girl anne marie held captive because of her amazing ability to talk to all species of animals which helps predict races charlie and itchy free her and try to help her find a family while learning a lot about themselves br br this movie is one of the few non disney that will appeal to both kids and adults kids will enjoy the funny characters and lively animation while adults will enjoy the nice sweet plot and the more than normal developed characters one thing that keeps this down is that it's a musical normally that's a good thing but the music here is honestly terrible they tend to jump around almost sounding ad libbed with next to no instrumental backing in fact these are probably the worst songs i've ever heard in an animated movie but luckily the rest of the film is strong enough to not fall apart because of some bad notes br br the ending of this movie works but i honestly hate it it's sad but happy but more sad than happy and makes the movie feel like it needs a sequel considering how bad the sequel made to this was i wish the ending wouldn't have warranted a sequel and it would've wrapped up into a nice super happy ending this is one of the few movies i feel this way about but i do br br overall this is a nice family film with odd themes thrown in but nonetheless good entertainment br br my rating out of 85 mins g
<START> vivah is in my book the best movie of 2006 period in my book it is one of the best 100 movies ever made in bollywood its sad that this movie doesn't have that many reviews and isn't having that much popularity br br vivah is once again a true achievement from a director who does it again after hahk and maine pyar kiya sooraj has once again pulled off a brilliant one vivah br br this is the most simple and cute movies that i've seen this year after seeing don 2 which was crap and later dhoom 2 which even beat don in that matter i finally see a movie which is so close to my heart and my culture br br i don't know why bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture which we have and are making hollywood remake style crap movies like dhoom 2 and don br br the story is beautiful and relates much to the indian system of arranged marriage which i too would like to be a part of our system which teaches us to obey elders follow them and of course obey their thoughts is so brilliantly shown in this movie of course there isn't any force in choosing your life partner and it should be a brief meeting between the couple and its up to them to decide as it is brilliantly shown in this movie br br coming back to the movie vivah is a story of journey between the beautiful period of engagement and marriage the phase where the guy meets the girl both understand each other both try to assess if they could love each other for seven generations as our system says and the various which occur during marriages br br amrita rao is brilliant in the movie shahid is ok and alok nath and anupam kher are awesome the songs are brilliant i especially like the hamari shaadi main hafte reh gye chaar and do anjaane ajnabi br br overall a must see for anyone who still believes in the indian culture and tradition and i certainly do br br go see this movie i just have to say one word br br bliss
<START> following a car accident a mad scientist jason evers keeps the head of his fiancee virgina leith alive he then goes on the prowl looking for the perfect body to make her whole again pretty lame all the way around nothing redeeming here also in the cast are leslie daniels bonnie sharie and bruce brighton someone should have helped put this one out of its misery let it die
<START> i gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it less br br scientists have developed a formula for replicating any organism in their lab a run down warehouse in l a they create a t rex a group of industrial spies break in to steal the formula and the remainder of the film is one endless foot chase br br of course the t rex a rubber puppet gets loose and commences to wipe out the cast it has the amazing ability to sneak up within 2 or 3 feet of someone without them noticing and then promptly bites their head off br br one cast member escapes in a police car and spends the remainder of the film driving aimlessly through the city she is of such superior mental ability that she can't even operate the radio she never makes any attempt to drive to a substation or a donut shop and appears hopelessly lost br br the t rex wreaks havoc throughout the city there are blazing gun battles and buildings cardboard mock ups blowing up but a single police car or the army nor anyone else ever shows up such activity must be commonplace in los angeles br br we can only hope that a sequel isn't planned
<START> although i generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are waste of time this film is an exception i didn't actually know so far until reading the previous comment that this was a remake so my opinion is purely about the actual film and not a comparison br br the story and the way it is written is no question it is capote there is no need for more words br br the play of anthony edwards and eric roberts is superb i have seen some movies with them each in one or the other i was certain that they are good actors and in case of eric i always wondered why his sister is the number 1 famous star and not her brother this time this certainty is raised to fact no question his play just as well as the play of mr edwards is clearly the top of all their profession br br i recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your dvd shelves
<START> okay this movie is a pure pleasure it has the ever so violent horror mixed with a little suspense and a lot of black comedy the dentist really starts to loose his mind and it's enjoyable to watch him do so this movie is for certain people though either you'll completely love it or you will totally hate it a good movie to rent and watch when you don't got anything else to do also recommended psycho iii
<START> well i do like the gore in this movie it is genuingly unsetteling anyone that's been to the dentist will know why the story really isn't that bad corbin bersen's character's motivations do make a lot more sense than in most horror movies br br i've seen worse acting directing script etc but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie so it comes down to if you enjoy that type of thing or not i tried to watch the sequel but it was exactly exactly the same thing as this movie just keep in mind if you enjoy people getting tortured at the dentist then this is the movie for you
<START> paulie was cute cool enjoyable and quite fulfilling i went to this movie expecting to view a typical family movie one that within moments would find me unconscious and drooling on the floor my mindframe immediately changed when i was quickly captivated by the movie's wholesomeness it is rare that you find a family movie that is thorough and can be coined wholesome most are cheaply made written and produced purely to attract young family members who'll then drag the unfortunate elders to a mind numbing 65 minutes of overused sight gags and plots br br oh yes paulie had a plot it told the story of a young girl marie and her best friend paulie the parrot who unbelievably could talk and quite frequently held conversations with her marie's dorky jerk father found this unbelievable and thought paulie to be damaging to his 4 year old daughter's mental health and quickly tore them apart we follow paulie's adventures and misadventures as he attempts to reunite with his beloved owner meeting many memorable characters along the way oh yeah paulie really could smart talk and had a swift new jersey accent cool the plot held thick and entertaining throughout keeping me attracted paulie is the best family movie i have found and wholeheartedly enjoyed ever seriously pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie with the whole family no sleeping i promise
<START> i saw this movie for a number of reasons the main being mira sorvino with her on the cast it couldn't be so bad and it even seemed like it had some mystery and olivier martinez was her boyfriend at the time and he was pretty good in unfaithful' the story is set in spain so it could be an exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses br br if you're thinking about the same thing let me warn you this is a truly awful uninteresting boring movie the only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic br br the story is contrived with sub plots that add nothing to the narrative they try to build a slasher thriller with a look at fascism in spain but fail horribly the twists have no credibility and the so called investigation leads nowhere br br the characters are paper thin i didn't care about anyone more than that they're irritating and pretty hateful people br br the acting is atrocious mira what is wrong with you why mira you're an oscar winner keep some dignity her character was weak but that is no excuse for such an awful performance she seems to be sleepwalking all movie long come to think of it i actually think i saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes i used to think this woman was sexy well she isn't here if you want to look at some skin try romi and michelle because there's nothing to see here and that accent my god br br olivier martinez is even worst it's too painful to remember his performance to describe it here im sorry but i canÂ´t ive suffered enough with this garbage br br this whole movie is depressing it's so bad in every way it's a wonder how it was even made a lousy team to produce a lousy script and make some money over the actor's name don't fall for it br br avoid it br br
<START> this is the best of the 43 films that rainer werner fassbinder made his most successful at least he was one of the leading directors in the new germany after wwii br br hanna schygulla was magnificent as the cold calculating maria bruan who lost her husband to the war found him after she took an american soldier as a lover lost him again after he went to jail for her and found him agin at the end her day and a half marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together at the end br br such is life things come and go and you do the best you can you can give up or adjust you way of thinking to survive even though maria adjusted her thinking and did what she had to do she never stopped loving hermann which makes the end such a tragedy br br excellent drama
<START> just got my copy of this dvd two disc set and while not perfect i found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time i have to say right up front that i am a huge fan of zombie movies and i truly think that the fine people who made these films must be too i also have a soft spot for people who are trying sometimes against all odds to live a dream and again these people are doing it is this some award winning collection of amazing film no not even close but for what they do on their meager budgets these films should be recommended for me the bottom line is always was i entertained did i have a good time with this movie and here the answer to both was yes the first in the series is also the most raw it opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something cut to some years later and a new housing community is built over the old reactor site some kids making a video fall into a hole and find themselves trapped in the bottom levels of the facility they get rescued but the hole is not sealed and the people from the opening start lumbering out of the hole soon the whole town is overtaken by the undead and these zombies are fun they go from cool rot makeup to the cheapest slap on white face ever but they are fun the whole movie culminates in a showdown between the final survivors of the area and the undead with our heroes going into the reactor's lower levels to take out the flesh eating zombies and seal the hole forever pretty cheesy but i think it was meant to be still it moves very fast has buckets of gruesome effects and really tries to have some style the acting is uneven but a few good performances shine through and one really should listen to the commentary track i went back and watched it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trials and fun that the crew and cast experienced on the movie director todd sheets seems pretty proud of this his first film but also has no delusions he knows it's a trashy zombie movie but he does show respect to people involved also sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field the behind the scenes of zombie bloodbath is pretty fun as well i felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for there are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like cnn fox and mtv over all a fun little film that is very rough around the edges but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride i have seen many dv films and some shot of video films and many are quite dull but this one really wasn't while newer dv films are technically superior they just aren't fun overall this is a solid if a bit flawed release with plenty of extras and tons of gore and splatter while not breaking any grand rules of move making i found the series to be fun and always a laugh so i give this set a solid recommendation todd sheets was not trying to make award winning art here folks he was trying sometimes against all odds it seems to make fun zero budget splattery horror and to that end he has succeeded in spades
<START> i would have rated this film a minus 10 but sadly it is not offered br br why i didn't walk out in the first five minutes of this movie i cannot say i should have gone with my instinct and left immediately several people in our theater did and sadly i didn't follow them out br br the story lacked all criteria for a movie no plot awful acting even robin williams was so disappointing that i may never see another film he is in not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk i did like the tazer scene too bad it didn't shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film
<START> why me why should i be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot at least if i can warn other people off it will have been worthwhile br br i had to watch this horrible movie for a college course otherwise i would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and steered clear the movie was slow had painfully little character development and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an la style token black man br br if you want to experience the stereotypical la feeling of dizzying superficiality watch the movie note though that this movie does not depict what we have come to think of as an la lifestyle it is a wonderful example of the products that arise from it
<START> i attempted watching this movie twice and even then fast forwarding the irritating parts but still could not make it to the end br br i don't understand how this movie genuinely got any good reviews i think these people giving such good reviews are just trying to hype the movie for marketing purposes their reviews seem very unrealistic and it looks like an inside job which makes things more pitiful movies should get true positive comments on their own steam and not contrived ones br br the acting was reminiscent of a cheesy porno movie and not in a funny way i don't mind low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it br br i found the lead character to be irritating his facial expressions and humor was unbearably childish i thought this was intentional to make the womens conspiracy seem more enjoyable and founded but they were even worse br br the script was also very awkward his bosses overdone business speech and the unfunny sarcastic remarks br br i did not find anything redeeming about this movie other than some of the attractive women br br never have i felt that a rating was this misleading i was interested by its premise but scared off by everything else of course see it if you want but i just didn't want anyone else to get their hopes up waste their time br br maybe it is just me probably not
<START> there is this private campground in plymouth massachusetts that's been around since 1959 my grandparents were among its founders my parents had a site starting in 1965 and my two brothers have sites there now br br this doesn't have anything directly to do with the movie bear with me br br i spent summers at blueberry hill from when i was five years old to when i was eighteen and it is to people like me to whom this film speaks the ones for whom a group camp in the woods was as my fiancÃ©e tells of me the good and happy place if you've never experienced the lifestyle indian summer will probably be lost on you don't bother it's not quick paced it doesn't have rapid cuts the plots aren't in the least bit convoluted it has no explosions such dramatic tension as exists is mild there aren't any a list actors there are no rapid fire quips just to show off how clever the scriptwriters are other than perhaps kimberley williams' killer line about how her fiancÃ© shouldn't overwind his toys that is not the least degree what this movie is about any more than the godfather is a slasher flick just because it has a lot of on screen gore br br but indian summer is godfather's polar opposite if you have experienced the lifestyle see this movie don't read any more just do it br br for me this is a 9 10 film
<START> i really have to say this was always a favorite of mine when i went to see my grandma and it still is it is very very close to the book the way it is filmed and the players were just all excellent i have to recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it almost everyone i talk to hates tv movies but this was really great i gave it 10 10
<START> i really enjoyed this drama from sidney lumet the best word i could come up to describe it with is insane it throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and doesn't let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end trust me this movie will keep you guessing the entire way through br br the story is very well crafted and almost brilliant it's almost like a more complicated tarantino type story the acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts excellent cast i also loved the cinematography it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film it was all great br br this movie is excited exhausting and heartbreaking it's almost hard to watch but you'll be glad that you did
<START> one of my favorite shows in the 80's after the first season it started going downhill when they decided to add jean bruce scott to the cast deborah pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and ernest borgnine's character go at it with each other the last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for in the second season unfortunately during those days blacks did not last long on television shows some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third season it was more about the human characters than airwolf and it was not shown until almost at the end of the show when it went to usa it was disgusting
