<START> october sky is a film that will steal your heart fill your mind with vivid imagery and lift your spirit the tale of homer hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first especially when the film is set in a mining town where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine but homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps with the encouragement of miss riley a friendly teacher members of his father's staff and his friends homer attempts to make his dream a reality br br yet as in any true to life story there are many stops along the way director joe johnston lowers us into the coal mines where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock with lit helmets and bent posture they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness the hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work br br contrasting the mine shaft's lugubrious load are the images of homer and his friend's rocket launches underneath the blue bowl of sky rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere and nothing can match the scene when homer sees sputnik for the first time br br yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters homer's father is a classic hardened man but he has a soft side as well we see that he does love his son despite their many arguments the love and support of miss riley is evident as well best of all the film is uncomfortable it doesn't tie everything up in a nice bow it tears at you lifts you up it keeps an air of reality which is important in a film like this br br this film can be considered a complete work at first i was disappointed that the film did not continue with homer's life i didn't want it to end then i realized that's what a good film does to a person if it has done its job you won't want it to end and october sky accomplishes just that
<START> although the movie takes place at an ivy league college it was in fact shot entirely in northern arizona mostly at northern arizona university in flagstaff in the fall of 1976 i was involved in the theater department there and most of the extras in the film are then members of the theater department br br there is an absolutely ludicrous scene in this film if you know your arizona geography that shows several cast members riding bikes from the college to a creek we nau'ers know that the campus and said creek actually oak creek canyon are about 35 miles apart and while the trip there is all downhill it would be literally impossible to ride a bike back up that same road
<START> i watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 lbs and house m d tucci's character is brilliant but socially inept out of choice similar to laurie's character house but without the acerbic wit that laurie brings to house meanwhile tucci's 'straight guy' the emphatic doctor seger is not developed into a more interesting character like the fallible 'straight guys' cuddy and wilson indira varma's character adrienne holland is too similar to jennifer morrison's doctor cameron to be a co incidence br br someone at cbs obviously noticed the success of house m d and told his staff to get him her a similar show hoping that mimicry would prove successful however copying a show like house demands the same high level balance of wit and suspense and tucci and company are just not up to the challenge br br i didn't know the show was canceled until i read the comments on imdb but it doesn't come as a surprise to me
<START> de vierde man the fourth man 1984 is considered one of the best european pycho thrillers of the eighties this last work of dutch director paul verhoeven in his home country before he moved to hollywood to become a big star with movies like total recall basic instinct and starship troopers is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author jeroen krabbe going to the seaside for recovering there he meets a mysterious femme fatale renee soultendieck and starts a fatal love affair with her he becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstances br br de vierde man is much influenced by the old hollywood film noire and the psycho thrillers of alfred hitchcock and orson wells it takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to push the story straight forward the suspense is sometimes nearly unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of italian cult director dario argento br br the cast is also outstanding especially krabbe's performance as mentally disturbed writer that opened the doors for his international film career the living daylights the fugitive if you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on tv video or dvd don't miss it
<START> i saw this movie when i was really little it is by far one of the strangest movies i have ever seen now normally i like weird movies but this was just a bit too much br br there's not much of a plot to the movie if anything it starts out like toy story where toys come to life and raggedy ann and andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend babette from there craziness ensues there's the greedy the looneys a sea monster named gazooks and a bunch of pirates singing show tunes all of which just made the movie weirder also i can't help but feel that babette is annoying and a bit too whiny she definitely didn't help the movie br br now even though i didn't like this movie there were a few cute parts i liked the camel's song even though it was a song about being lonely it had a friendly feel to it then there was sir leonard while most of the looneys were just plain nuts sir leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest king koo koo was just a little dirtbag that made dr evil look like a serious villain also there was raggedy andy's song no girl's toy it was definitely good song for little boys who wanted to act tough but honestly even these things didn't make the movie any better but remember this is just my perspective br br while i personally wouldn't recommend this movie even i have to admit it does have its charming moments see it if you're interested but only if you're in the mood for something really out of the ordinary
<START> it isn't the worst film ever made the actors aren't apalling and the script and director are not completely inept br br it isn't the best film ever made the actors aren't excellent and the script and director are not completely brilliant br br it falls somewhere in the middle a fun somewhere an enjoyable well constructed somewhere br br no need to say don't take it seriously or so bad its good or it wasn't scary none of these comments are relevant br br cut has atmosphere it's that atmosphere which is actually very unique and the one really original aspect of the movie which personally is what makes the film for me
<START> went to see this finnish film and i've got to say that it is one of the better films i've seen this year the intrigue is made up of 5 6 different stories all taking place the very same day in a small finnish town the stories come together very nicely in the end reminding perhaps a bit of the way tarantino's movies are made most of the actors performed very well which most certainly is needed in realistic dramas of this type i especially enjoyed the acting by sanna hietala the lead actress and juha kukkonen i noticed btw that imdb has got the wrong information about sanna her name as you might have noticed in my review is not heikkilÃ¤ but hietala
<START> i don't know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of tetsuo or not why tetsuo because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious tetsuo rip off the concept is similar editing is equally frantic and fast which is good because aside from making the movie more dynamic it obscures some flaws caused by low budget and other factors br br there is lot more gore less eroticism and in the case of meatball machine the transformation of human being into a creature that's partially a machine sounds familiar called necroborg very original is caused by slimy little aliens br br these slimy little scums from outer space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other they infest the body somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other necroborgs their aim is to defeat another alien who is in another necroborg rip it out of the corpse and eat it br br all in all the plot sounds somewhat silly and i didn't expect much but at the end i actually enjoyed this film br br as i said before this is a low budget flick but it's still relatively decent don't expect much from actors they're mostly not very good but it can be tolerated i liked the atmosphere and gore certain bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited although the story is not too original it possesses certain charm to me at least br br 7 out of 10
<START> spaced invaders is one of the funniest movies iÂ´ve ever seen i donÂ´t understand why this movie didnÂ´t get better critics itÂ´s funny harmless and sweet i first watched it when i was 11 and i really fell in love with it 2 days later i got it on vhs p till today iÂ´ve shown it to many friends and they all liked it but nobody knew the movie before i think thatÂ´s the problem nearly nobody knows it so nearly nobody can like it this movie never got a real chance thatÂ´s sad si has really the potential of a comedy like monsters inc or spaceballs ok enough displeasure what i really wanted to say is that if you ever want to laugh your head off watch it even if you donÂ´t get mad about it itÂ´s worth watching prepare to laugh earth scum
<START> i live in missouri so the direct effects of terrorism are largely unknown to me this brought it home that two men would put themselves on the line in the way that those members of fdny and nypd did just to document the horror that unfolded on that day this film is a testament to those who lost their lives and the true evil that terror brings
<START> i managed to grab a viewing of this with the aid of mst3k and oh boy even with the riffing this movie was excruciatingly bad imagine someone whose competence with a camera could be out done by a monkey br br the highlights what little there were came from the special effects which were ok the acting for the most part was also ok though nothing special it was of a higher quality than other b movies i have seen in the past br br the rest of this movie is dismally bad the camera work often looks like they've just put the camera man on roller skates and pushed him along the story if it can be called that is so full of holes it's almost funny it never really explains why the hell he survived in the first place or needs human flesh in order to survive the script is poorly written and the dialogue verges on just plane stupid the climax to movie if there is one is absolutely laughable br br if you can't find the mst3k version avoid this at all costs
<START> robert stack never really got over losing a best supporting actor oscar for his role as kyle in written on the wind to anthony quinn's 12 minute performance in lust for life stack plays the deeply disturbed alcoholic son of an oil tycoon he has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised mitch played by rock hudson they both love the same woman lucy lauren bacall who becomes kyle's wife kyle's sister marylee dorothy malone is a drunken slut who's in love with mitch their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of douglas sirk who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films including imitation of life all that heaven allows magnificent obsession and many others br br make no mistake this is a potboiler and stack and dorothy malone make the most of their roles malone winning a best supporting actress oscar there's one amazing scene mentioned in other comments where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase we're led to believe that marylee sleeps with everyone including the guy that pumps the gas because she's in love with mitch mitch wants nothing to do with her he's so in love with lucy that out of loyalty to kyle he wants to go to work in iran to avoid temptation i doubt he'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was br br hudson and bacall have the less exciting roles here hudson's mitch is the good guy who's been cleaning up kyle's messes for his entire life and bacall is mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players br br in sirk's hands written on the wind is an effective film and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting the director had a gift for this type of movie and though he had many imitators he never had an equal
<START> i have a deep liking for this film despite it appearing deliberately less 'polished' than the other fred and ginger films not to mention the slightly problematic casting of harriet hillard in the lead romantic role br br once again with these films the plot is of a minor consequence astaire plays a rather unlikely sailor who happens to be a brilliant former hoofer of course and rogers an aspiring performer in a seedy dime a dance music hall although their relationship is bright and fun to watch they are bogged down by an un involving main story of hilliard and randolph scott not succeeding in finding any chemistry between them br br although it was a last minute decision hilliard was rather miscast in this as she doesn't have the screen presence to give this film what it needs despite being sweet and likable throughout the film may have benefited in promoting lucille ball's wise cracking worldy brassy character to a larger role as she simply shined in every small scene and would have made a great helen broderick type side kick to rogers in this kind of bright film see 'stage door' made the following year for an example of wonderful scenes between these two fantastic actresses that scott's one dimensional neanderthal character eventually falls in love with hilliard's is even harder to believe than astaire being in the navy br br now onto the important part the singing and dancing nothing more can be said about let's face the music and dance other than it is brilliant and moving and perfectly executed and i often finish watching that scene with tears in my eyes however other songs in the film deserve some recognition as well i'm putting all my eggs in one basket is a lovely example of the comedic instincts of astaire and rogers and almost pokes fun at their reputation of bursting into spontaneous perfectly synchronized dancing other highlights are i'd rather lead the band and let yourself go which show how these two talents could perform as brilliantly alone as together i nearly forgot to mention that this is one of the few if not the only time we see astaire brilliantly play on the piano it seems this man's talents were endless br br overall i actually prefer this to 'top hat' and 'swing time' although only just as it is more earthy and performed so enthusiastically by all involved it is hard to dislike the fun factor
<START> as i was watching this movie i was thinking ok it'll get good any moment i was wrong the real best part of this movie was when it was over a complete waste of 92 minutes all seriousness aside the best part was when the wendigo finally showed up which was at the end and you couldn't really even see him that good and the tail end was really kind of dumb as well there was too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen but was a let down the worse part is there was more talk of the wendigo then there was wendigo for the creature to be so bad you definitely couldn't tell it by this movie
<START> i have just watched the movie for the first time i wanted to watch it as i like drew barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies br br the movie is about a girl played by young and beautiful drew barrymore who moves from nyc to la in order to get over her recently troubled loss short after moving to a guy who falls in love with her it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin doppelganger who haunts her br br the movie is quite poor and lousy both the dialogs and the acting make the film not really worth seeing it summing up it is just something for the fans of drew barrymore
<START> i watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to billy elliott 2000 both films are based around a troubled father son relationship in both films the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them br br the major difference that i found between the films was that october sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film laura dern puts in a moving performance and chris cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in american beauty 1999 joe johnston surprised me with his subtle directing very different from his other directorial features such as jumanji 1995 and jurassic park iii 2001 br br
<START> i've seen all four of the movies in this series each one strays further and further from the books this is the worst one yet my problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way the directors and producers should have named it any thing other than love's abiding joy the only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters willie missie henry clark scottie and cookie the names ages genders of the children are wrong the entire story line is no where in the book br br i find it a great disservice to janette oke her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way the music is too loud the actors are not convincing they lack emotions br br if you want a good family movie this might do it is clean don't watch it though if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book i hope that this will be the last movie from this series but i doubt it if there are more movies made i wish michael landon jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines the books are excellent and if closely followed would make excellent movies
<START> i haven't read a biography of lincoln so maybe this was an accurate portrayal br br and maybe it's because i'm used to the equally alienating and unrealistic worshiping portrayals that unnaturally deify lincoln as brilliant honorable and the savior of our country br br but why would they make a movie representing lincoln as a buffoon while henry fonda made an excellent lincoln his portrayal of him as an aw shucks i'm just a simple guy seemed a little insulting br br granted that was bushie jr 's whole campaign to make us think he was just a regular guy so we wouldn't care that he's a rich privileged moron but that's a whole other story br br not only did the film show lincoln as sort of a simple almost simple minded kind of guy the film states that lincoln just sort of got into law by accident and that he wasn't even that interested in the law only with the falsely simplistic idea of the law being about rights wrongs in the film he's not a very good defense attorney he lounges around with his feet on the table and makes fun of the witnesses and the outcome is mostly determined by chance luck br br furthermore partly because this was financed by republicans in reaction to some play sponsored by democrats that had come out and partly because it was just the sentiment of the times the film is unfortunately religious racist and conservative br br don't waste your time on this film
<START> saying this movie is extremely hard to follow and just as frustrating to sit through is putting it very mildly also saying that the current available print is dark dreary scratchy abysmally edited painfully dubbed seemingly censored and in almost unwatchable shape is also correct this film is in dire need of a good remastering from the full uncut original negative and seeing how it's reasonably atmospheric and won the director an award at the catalonia film festival it might actually be worth the trouble then again maybe not it's just impossible to tell in its current condition what kind of movie it actually is it starts fairly interesting if you can discount the completely senseless pre credits opening sequence which involves a deranged cat killing snake loving little girl named gerda the girls mom carla mÃ³nica randall who should have laid off the eyeliner a little bit splashes some gasoline around in the garage and torches the brat seemingly about as crazy as young gerda she goes to visit her estranged photographer ex boyfriend mario john cihangir caffari he's on vacation from work but so desperate to get away from carla that he begs his employers to set him up on an assignment any assignment she scowls you'll be sorry as he heads out the door well mario is assigned to photograph witches mountain somewhere in the pyrenees i believe before he gets to his destination he gets sight of a hottie on the beach named delia patty shepard and snaps a few pictures of her taking off her bikini top only slightly peeved she claims to be a single writer the two flirt and then decide it would be a swell idea if they went on the trip up the mountain together when they stop by her place so she can pack her bags mario suddenly hears loud sinister music delia claims he's just hearing things br br so the two begin their trip up the mountain taking a stop at a local inn to spend the night there they encounter a weird partially deaf crazy eyed innkeeper victor israel and delia claims someone was spying on here through her window the next day under some trance she wanders off up the mountain and is eventually located by mario who hops out of his jeep and runs after her while he's finding out what's up someone steals their wheels and they're forced to walk a piece eventually finding the jeep undamaged at the foot of a small ancient seeming abandoned village almost like someone was trying to intentionally lure them there well as we will see that's exactly what has happened in the village they encounter a friendly old woman named zanta ana farra who claims she's the only person still living there and lets them stay in her home mario takes some pictures of the abandoned city and when he develops them they are eerily full of people slightly creeped out he and delia begin to leave and get stuck in treacherous fog and have to pull over and camp out for the night the rest of the movie has to do with voodoo dolls black cats transforming into sexy women satanic rituals performed by ladies in their bras and a deadly fall off a cliff and yeah coincidentally carla the estranged wife turns out to be one of the witches too it all takes place in semi darkness and to be quite honest i didn't know what the hell was going on most of the time the inconclusive open ending is just an additional slap in the face to anyone having to suffer through the rest of this senseless mess br br honestly there are just a few things that stand out to me as being really good the first is actress shepard who has that great barbara steele kind of dark mysterious beauty there's also an excellent music score credited to fernando garcia morcillo and chanting songs which aided immensely in making this film as atmospheric as it is the location work is fairly decent but as i said the print is ugly as can be and it doesn't make a lick of sense so proceed with caution on this one
<START> finally we get a tv series where we get to see the acting talent episode one was excellent the script gave us a little more than usual yeah there was still the i'm not your father i'm your father and omigod you cheated on me rubbish but the script allowed the actors to actually feel and live those real moments rather than show us what it would feel like if like so many tv soaps do br br the camera work also gave us a little more than usual there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was no unnecessary 'shots inside shots or hand held camera crap' to add an artistic edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful scenery pictures as well br br nothing was over dramatised or melodramatic they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations the show lacked nothing in drama and was completely relevant it was such a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented our actors can be when given a real script a real opportunity thank you tony tilse sam miller channel ten and all cast and crew wonderful work please continue what you are doing your efforts are much appreciated and do not go unnoticed
