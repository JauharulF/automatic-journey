<START> an actor asks what's my motivation to understand his or her character after viewing this this docudrama this vague and haphazard farce a viewer wonders what anyone's motivation was br br this inept offspring of daytime t v the oprah show missed by a mile a great opportunity to explore weighty issues br br its characters were all shallow and superficial its story line far less socially redeeming than a simpsons episode it gratuitously portrayed investigating police as unprofessional and incompetent it failed to offer why the court might treat the main character a female child molester so differently than it would have a male perp br br why did this unrepentant woman begin grooming her second grade student beginning an affair with him when he returned to her sixth grade class why did the boy's mother testify in her behalf the simple answer is overwhelming narcissism plus generational rationalization and greed the movie gave no hint of that br br why wasn't the viewer informed that the victim's mother sold interview rights to print and television tabloids parading her adolescent son on the today show that mary kay's lawyer cashed in she herself appealing a son of sam statute so she could benefit from her crime by selling her story to the highest bidder br br why wasn't it explained that letourneau's father was a former right wing republican congressman the 1972 american independent presidential candidate the john birch society president in 1983 john schmitz's political career ended when he was found to have had children by his own community college student exposed only when that mistress sexually mutilated their infant son yet letourneau's dad had removed his many kids from too liberal catholic schools fighting to keep all schoolchildren from receiving any sex education br br a month after her conditional release again pregnant with the now 14 year old's second daughter mary kay received 7 1 2 years in prison for numerous probation violations a prophetic editorial regarding the sad affair then appeared in the seattle times at the end of two wretched hours letourneau was led off to jail and this salacious melange of made for tv seaminess was over until casting begins br br sure enough 18 months later filming of this travesty was underway
<START> how to lose friends and alienate people came out in 2008 it bombed at u s box offices it's an absolutely hilarious film with a great cast simon pegg is great playing sidney young who wrote the book how to lose friends and alienate people i know it's not a true story the only way i know that is because sidney wants to go out with an actress named sophie maes sophie maes doesn't exist but other than that the film could be real how to lose friends and alienate people is probably the funniest film of 2008 and i think you definitely should see it as i said earlier the film has a fantastic cast including kirsten dunst spider man the virgin suicides danny huston the number 23 30 days of night gillian anderson the x files megan fox transformers confessions of a teenage drama queen jeff bridges the big lebowski the vanishing overall how to lose friends and alienate people is hilarious i think simon pegg and kirsten dunst do work well together and i think you should see it though there is some odd nudity including trans sexuals it's a hilarious and awesome comedy one of simon pegg's best br br the plot sidney young a journalist from england travels down to new york to work at sharp magazines while there he meets an actress named sophie maes and tries to sleep with her before his boss does
<START> how can you go wrong with the amazing ramones what a crime that two of them are already dead it reminds me of the dennis leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever i'm paraphrasing here but you get the idea br br rock and roll high school tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration it's extremely silly stuff but there's an optimism about it that's refreshing even if they do resort to blowing up the building who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world rock and roll high school is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society it's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers rather rock and roll is the only thing they can trust br br but most important this is pure exploitation br br take none of it seriously just go in and have a good time if this wasn't what high school life was like in the seventies then it should have been
<START> it's pretty clear that the director and production crew set out to paint a less than flattering picture of the palestinian girl and her family the film and it's website tries to imply that ayat has a secret reason for blowing herself and rachel up a boyfriend problem perhaps pregnancy neatly glossed over is the fact that ayat had herself just witnessed the death of a close friend at the hands of the israelis' just outside her home gosh so why on earth would a young pretty intelligent girl with plans for college go and do such a thing could it be that the hormonal emotional teenager was traumatized by seeing seeing someone she loved die before her very eyes this detail merits all of 5 seconds in the movie another neatly sidestepped detail is that avigail levy rachels' mother could have prevented the destruction of the building the akhras family lived in along with 22 other families one distinctly gets the impression that she's offering this as a concession should mrs akhras agree to speak with her why should i she says since the movie was made the home has been destroyed apparently the interview didn't result in what she wanted so bring on the bulldozers mrs levy claimed that she wanted the movie to be cathartic as well as a symbol of hope a chance to transcend entrenched hatreds instead she uses it as an excuse to harangue ayats mother while dangling the house as a carrot moreover although the two women live only 4 miles apart she is so out of touch with the realities of the occupation for her palestinian neighbors that she really thinks that mrs akhras can just drop over for a cup of coffee please and she forgoes the one chance she had to meet mrs akhras in person and see what kind of life she lives the akras family originally came from jaffa but now live crammed into a refugee camp only 4 miles from where the levys live in comparative luxury any sympathy i would have had for the obviously well to do mrs levy is dissolved by her air of self righteous bitchiness by contrast ayats mother comes off as kind forthright and loving in spite of the best efforts by the post production crew to paint her and her family as monsters heck even the music and sound design was one sided i guess the muezzin sings all day every day 4 miles from the levy family home always in a sharply contrasting key from the sappy new age music that scores this drab excuse for a documentary also there is the small matter of translations mrs levy directly addresses the camera in english when she has something worked out to say ahead of time hebrew when she doesn't mrs akhras spoke only arabic which received sometimes a translation sometimes transliteration always awkward and very suspect for a supposedly objective movie they also sweated her under the lights while mrs levy sat in air conditioned comfort rotten editing for mrs akhras' segments too i gave it a 2 because i liked ayats mother and father who seemed like good decent people shame on hbo producers and director for releasing such a stink bomb
<START> the first time i had the window of opportunity to see this all but forgotten classic was back in the early 1980's at one of our art houses as a revival as i watched this fever dream of an exercise in 1930's sexuality i thought yowza they got away with murder in europe back in the day unfortunately this film was heavily cut in it's original u s release by the blue nosed hayes office the staunch government censorship board started by the holier than thou bible thumper will hayes a former post office official if you can believe that due to it's overall theme of human sexuality heaven's forbid humans actually had sex in the 1930's the plot of ecstasy concerns a young woman played by hedy lamarr who marries a much older man and later regrets it she lamarr meets a handsome younger man has an affair with him resulting in a divorce from previous husband another no no in hollywood movies back then divorce despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933 it was probably the director's first time working in the sound format i e the film seems to possess techniques that were used mostly in silent films i e 1920's expressionism's it's still worth searching out for a window into early european talking pictures along with luis bunuels l'age dor 1930 and karl gustav dryer's 'vampyre' 1931 not rated but contains that infamous nude swimming scene some thinly veiled sexual references which would fare little more than a pg 13 by today's standards but would have easily landed the dreaded 'x' back in the 30's if it existed then
<START> this is one of joan crawford's best talkies it was the first gable crawford pairing and made it evident to mgm and to audiences that they were a sizzling team leading the studio to make seven more films with them as co stars br br the film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister who after their father loses everything in the stock market crash must fend for themselves and work for a living life is hard in the depression and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile and they resort to underworld activity br br joan crawford is excellent as the socialite turned moll she's smart complex and believable she even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actors' early talkie acting style clark gable is a diamond in the rough masculine and gruff as the no nonsense gangster who becomes involved with crawford's character the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite norma shearer in a free soul securing his position as top male sex symbol at mgm br br if you like crawford in this type of role don't miss paid which she did a year earlier which is also among her best early talkie performances br br
<START> prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films and there's a good reason for that because it's not one of the best but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer this is certainly among the best of the lesser known smaller films the film does have some connection to blockbusters for a start it's an early directorial effort for renny harlin the capable director behind a number of action films including die hard 2 cliffhanger and deep blue sea and secondly we have an early role for lord of the rings star viggo mortensen the film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting we focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years this was the prison where a man named charles forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison's governor naturally the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace and when the old execution room is reopened the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance br br the film is not exactly the shawshank redemption but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base this is a good job too because other than the basic premise the film doesn't really have a 'plot' to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting the horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but it's never over the top which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered being released in a decade of excess the murders themselves are rather good and imaginative however and provide some major highlights as the film goes on we start to delve more into the back story of the vengeful convict's ghost and while it's fairly interesting some things about it don't make sense and it drags the film down a little still everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall i have to say that prison is a film well worth tracking down
<START> the title overstates the content of this movie somewhat which might lead to some unrealized expectations frankly speaking there's very little panic in the streets to be seen here in fact throughout the movie very few people actually know that there's a murderer on the loose who may well be spreading the plague to everyone and anyone he encounters having said that what we do have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts out reasonably high anyway because unlike the people in the streets the viewer knows what's going on and that director elia kazan builds very deliberately as the plague infected killer is sought one of the more interesting sidebars i found was the developing relationship between dr reed richard widmark and police captain warren paul douglas at the beginning the two really don't like each other even though they have to work together by the end they've forged a real bond of respect for each other kazan did a good job with that br br pretty much all the performances here were excellent widmark and douglas were great and i was quite taken with a very early look at jack palance playing what would become his typical heavy role i found very little to criticize here perhaps barbara bel geddes came across as a little bit flat as reed's wife nancy but her role wasn't really central to the story all in all an excellent piece of work 9 10
<START> old jane's mannered tale seems very popular these days i have lost count of the number of versions going around probably the reason is that her ruts are our ruts even at this late date this tv mini series gives it a mannered telling suitable to the novel headstrong opinionated emma is a pretty modern girl when you think about it even though the ambience of jane austen's world may seem a tad artificial to us today if you haven't seem emma i'll only say that self sufficient emma does get her comeuppance it's worth watching to find out how the acting honours here go to the ladies kate prunella lucy and samantha they could almost have had a psychic connection to old jane
<START> dark wolf quick review let's get right to it this is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh t on it it's just an awful movie it's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an 80's high school drama film what's worse is that poor kane hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf kane f cking hodder someone's trying to ensure that playing jason voorhees is the height of his film career br br anyway former playmate jaime bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf too it's kind of a crappy cop drama with the world's worst looking werewolf in it but it does have moments of near rampant nudity but that's about all want to know more okay the werewolf is generally an ugly looking black blur zipping around the screen and when we're privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence we're presented with something that resembles a full motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the playstation the first playstation the cg animation is really that primitive only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit 2 10 br br www residenthazard com
<START> i thought the movie was actually pretty good i enjoyed the acting and it moved along well the director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell i have to see the big budget one coming out today obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable when you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it there were some things that could of been better but most are budget related the acting was pretty good the f x and stunts were well done a couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst and the boy who played the child these kind of films have kept la working and this is one that turned out ok
<START> this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in minnesota and even i can't believe they dumped cleveland yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don't watch this junk
<START> i've been impressed with chavez's stance against globalisation for sometime now but it wasn't until i saw the film at the amsterdam documentary international film festival that i realize what he has really achieved this film tells the story of coup conspiracy by venezuela's elite the oil companies and oil loving corrupt western governments to remove democratically elected president chavez and return venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship this film is must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice and is also a lesson to the rest of world i commend the people of venezuela for taking matter into their own hands and saving their country from the likes of halliburton and the bush regime
<START> this movie really kicked some ass i watched it over and over and it never got boring angelina jolie really kicked some ass in the movie you should see the movie you won't be disappointed and another reason you should see the movie is because the guy from the x files is in it david duchovny
<START> the matador 2005 pierce brosnan greg kinnear hope davis philip baker hall dylan baker brosnan gives one of his best non bondian roles as a middle aged assassin facing a mid life crisis while on assignment in mexico where he befriends a square yet likable american businessman kinnear at his most affable and discovers there is more to life than death newbie filmmaker richard shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breath of fresh air into the 'buddy comedy' formula skewering what is anticipated of his leads and allowing brosnan to get his ya yas out with devilish glee a sleeper gem indie hit
<START> considering it was made on a low budget the day time ended manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects work br br the story involves a family who are about to move into their solar powered home in an isolated part of the mojave desert in southwestern california only to find it trashed by motorcycle vandals they think but their youngest daughter natasha ryan has begun to see mysterious things a green pyramid strange humanoid figures etc and only recently the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies thus the family led by jim davis and dorothy malone finds themselves face to face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time and space warp br br mixing in elements of 2001 a space odyssey and close encounters of the third kind the day time ended despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting remains interesting due to the superb special effects work of david allen the desert setting is very appropriate for this film's close encounters and while the movie cannot really be compared with either kubrick's or spielberg's films the day time ended is much better than many other 2001 close encounters knock offs i give credit to director john 'bud' cardos whose 1977 thriller kingdom of the spiders made for an interesting precursor to arachnophobia for at least trying and on that basis i give the day time ended a 7 out of 10
<START> mt little sister and i are self proclaimed horror movie buffs we have seen just about everything especially zombie flicks now we have seen a lot of good zombie movies and a lot of bad ones this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life not only was the acting horrible but the special effects graphics and ever zombie make up was the worst i have seen if you can even call it make up black eye shadow around the eyes this is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it's cover cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about do your selves a favor and do not watch this movie i was so adamant about this movie i went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying this movie sucks don't waste your time return now hahahhaa i don't want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this pos movie i don't even know how it got the ratings that it did t should be in the negative
<START> loved the film this was my first glimpse at both reese witherspoon and jason london both of which are two of my favorites must say that no matter how many times i've seen this movie i can't help but tear up one of those movies that should become a classic for all
<START> this movie is nothing like office space except in the premise office space was hilarious i would not recommend this movie to anyone as i laughed not once during the entire film mr cornbluth's self indulgent tirades quickly become more annoying than 15 jason alexanders in the same room if you decide to see this movie use a free rental or watch it at someone else's house so you can leave if necessary
<START> i have recently seen this production on dvd it is the first time i have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as i remembered at first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and i suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the bbc serials were back then i miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on sunday afternoons back then but that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been i am a bit of a jane eyre purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one i have recently re read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on reading the scene near the end where rochester questions jane about what st john was like i noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by dalton and clarke and done perfectly br br all the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way some even leave out the rivers family and their connection to jane altogether i also think this is the only production to include the gypsy scene done correctly br br the casting is perfect zelah clarke is like jane is described in the book small plain and dark and i disagree that she looked too old timothy dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as rochester portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off i agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted his expression is fantastically frightening but then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another a love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable oh to be loved by a man like that there were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however like when jane climbs in to bed with the dying helen and also when rochester takes jane shopping for her wedding things i thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks br br finally if you never see another production of jane eyre you simply most see this one it is simply perfection
