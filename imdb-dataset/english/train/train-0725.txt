<START> warning spoiler i have to agree with you it was almost there this was such a bad movie about such and interesting true story it had such promise but the acting was ridiculous at best some sets were beautiful and realistic others are something out of a theme park i found myself laughing as i watched what was suppose to be serious scenes i really wanted to like this movie but i couldn't the best part was the fight between friends that ended with the king dying i liked the queens' punishment and the final shot made a beautiful picture though there are so many better movies to watch i don't recommend this
<START> my husband and i were intrigued by the spectacle a strong willed southern lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the lapd the first season was must see tv for us unfortunately the stories of her personal life in the second season became so tedious and unworthy of the strong character that we stopped watching br br my husband and i were troubled by the episode where she tries to hide from her mother the fact that she is shacked up but the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss why would a strong middle aged woman do those things the answer is she wouldn't additionally my husband and i pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy it is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the murder scene or in an idealized family can't the script writers do something original from time to time as i mentioned we are no longer viewers we prefer shows that don't betray the characters and insult our intelligence
<START> i have read many comments on this site criticizing the blob for being cheesy and or campy the movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects what would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget locally produced valley forge pa christian shorts let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious that fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits for what it was meant to be this film is excellent i have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts blair witch project was one of them that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot bwp was pure excrement the blob on the other hand was well thought out well scripted and thoroughly entertaining the scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy the scene in the doctor's office with the blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece bottom line is i love this movie i challenge anyone out there to take 120 000 00 inflated for today's dollar value and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the blob it just can't be done period br br thank you for taking time to read this review
<START> it's this sort of movie that you try and imitate by attempting to realise something then flying through the air almost immediately i'd like to do that and i know you would too br br great stuff
<START> 7 if you're a kid 6 if you claim to be an adult this semi sequel to the lion king sees to spin off side characters timone and pumba retelling the original story through their eyes including the story of how they met in the grand tradition of disney inferior sequels are made and occasionally tv series featuring the adventures of minor characters from their biggest hits you can be as sceptical as you want about this but kids and fans of the series will likely not care their are enough jokes and songs and interesting things to ensure that this is one of the few above average sequels this works because of the charm of the much loved central characters the quick pace the in jokes involving the first film and for older viewers there are some funny gags the animation is as good as ever if a little less flamboyant than the original but the plot here is all about taking it easy hakuna matata br br timone and pumba decide to watch the events of the first film frequently stopping mid film to joke about parts of it like a real audience we see how timone is a near outcast he feels he does not fit in and decides to go looking beyond what he sees to find his ideal home on the way he meets pumba another outcast and they become friends soon they meet simba a lion cub natural predator of t and p but they form a trio however when simba realises he must follow his own destiny and leave the group it is up to the others to decide whether to help or not and how of course the usual disney elements and themes are here friendship good versus evil etc the plot is simple but works on many levels making it smarter than your average animated movie as the cg movies appear disney's traditional form must become smarter but not forget the roots which made them popular toy story and all that have come since have been clever with jokes to suit all ages and it seems this is the way the market is shifting however there will always be a place for films like this and you cannot go wrong buying this for the youngsters br br 7 out of 10
<START> an update of the skits and jokes you would have seen on a burlesque stage in the first half of the 20th century it's a string of several jokes acted out some of them you could tell your grandmother some of them not but it's a fairly safe bet she's heard them all before for what it tries to be it's not too bad before you rent it remember that it's an older style of entertainment and has more value as history than as comedy or titillation robin williams has a couple of bits but he's interchangeable with the other players
<START> this doesn't quite plumb the depths of creepshow 3 but it comes close it also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology which is distracting to say the least br br it also rather irritating rips off the twilight zone with the bookshop being comparable to serling's later night gallery unfortunately the producers writers forgot that serling would build up sympathy for his characters before messing them over none of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment br br framing story adam west is well himself he doesn't go the bruce wayne batman campy 60s route but he rarely does he simply plays the not particularly enigmatic jay there's an ominous spine chilling name to compare to the likes of dr terror eramus and the cryptkeeper and makes some mildly awkward creepy statements br br abernathy seen rod serling's a stop in willoughby then you've seen this the red herring of the nutso wife is introduced to no purpose but even the main character's friend identifies him as a wimp as well directed as can be expected but basically incoherent br br nex's diner reminiscent of various serling time travel stories mixed with steve allen's a meeting of minds most of the actors aren't too bad except for josh astin as cassius who manages to walk talk and even breathe awkwardly and the idea is mildly interesting but like abernathy it doesn't go anywhere the main character raises some relatively reasonable questions bugs out a bit who wouldn't and for some reason he ends up banished to a nuclear wasteland br br life replay not a bad little piece and manages to predate both click and creepshow 3 i suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls the main character is mildly sympathetic nothing substantially innovative here but it's okay br br fighting spirit you see the twist coming a mile away but like the main character it has some heart and it's a decent story of defeat and redemption br br finale so why do people end up in cold storage in silver lame suits don't know and doesn't make sense so all the protagonists wandered into the bookstore and became trapped kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer thanks guys and the guy in the first segment died so how did he get trapped did he visit the bookstore before he died got trapped and didn't die what huh i supposer this isn't expected to make sense because it's supernatural but still br br overall basically not dissimilar from the two newer twilight zone series or some episodes of tales from the darkside or monsters the last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time but there's nothing really spectacular here
<START> it's a good show and i find it funny finally the bad latin stereo types are over Â¡gracias seÃ±or lopez i love this show and i just started watching it about three months ago the whole concept about a latin family tv show really amazed me i am surprised that finally latinos have a good shot to be on tv this show is probably one the best i've seen it's funny heartwarming touchy and nice
<START> now i myself am a lover of the b movie genre but this piece of trash insults me to no end first of all the movie is starring lizzy mcguire's brother as the annoying little kid that goes looking for his lost 3 legged dog now please what kind of dumb ass mistakes a three legged dog for a god damn mutated crocodile please i ask you and heres another point for pondering why do they show the dinocroc on the back of the movie box being enormous and actually in the water i believe if memory serves the thing spent about 2 6 minutes in the water and was just shy of 6 feet tall that was a heart breaker but redeeming qualities to this movie were that it was so bad that i almost died laughing because believe me the bad acting made me wish for death but the fact remains that once again this thing is created by another military testing site to train super crocodiles for military combat or something like that from the source of all things evil e v i l corporation and let's not forget the characters let's see we have jerk off 1 as the male lead and half way decent chick who doesn't know how to act as the female lead to that i say wow the only thing worse then the acting was the end of course the heroes spend about what seems like 2 hours talking and planning some long elaborate way of killing the dinocroc only to have it fail and kill it in an ordinary way that could have taken about 15 seconds to come up with all in all this movie was beyond gay with its random opera music in the background and the fact that it was probably the gayest of all cgi monsters ever made along with the fact it of course was impervious to bullets and bombs otherwise it wouldn't have been made for the military duh by far the best scene was when lizzy mcguire's brother runs into the shack and the dinocroc eats him causing his head to pop clean off with a popping noise i might add i believe that you would be better off shooting yourself between the eyes then to watch dinocroc and as for the director i believe that we should get a bunch of people to hang him by a noose and all take turns kicking him in the crotch for wasting an hour and a half of our lives until he finally dies and then i can go on living
<START> this is one of those landmark films which needs to be situated in the context of time darkness in tallinn was made in 1993 it was a period of chaos confusion and gross disorder not only for ordinary denizens of estonia but also for countless citizens of other former nations which were a part of mighty soviet empire it was in such a tense climate that a young country named estonia was born as newly established governments are known to encounter teething problems estonia too faced numerous troubles as some corrupt officials manipulated state machinery for filling their dirty pockets by making use of their selfish means this is one of this film's core themes darkness in tallinn appears as an estonian film but it was made by a finnish director ilka jÃ¤rvilaturi he has tried his best to infuse as many possible doses of estonian humor this is why one can call it a comedy film of political undertones as ordinary people are involved in this film we can say that this film signifies good versus evil this is not a new concept as it is readily available in most of the religious books of different faiths darkness in talinn shows us as to how ordinary governments can also be toppled by corrupt people a nice film to watch on a sunny day
<START> it's hard to imagine a director capable of such godawful crap as 'notting hill' pulling off something as sensitive and as attractive as this but well here's the evidence and it's quite compelling several have alluded to tv drama and yes this does have a seventies play for today feel at times but is always a cut above mainly i think owing to some quite superlative acting from anne reid and to a fine script which shadow boxes with clichÃ© without ever getting one on the nose except maybe right at the end i didn't like either the tracking shot of indifferent goodbyes through the hallway nor the oh what a beautiful morning final scene she deserved a more studied finale than that i think after all that hard work the slippers business was a bit ott too on reflection br br what i mean about avoiding clichÃ© well i for one had a sinking expectation that the mature man may's daughter tries to set her up with would be cast in 2 dimensions as a repulsive old bore so as to point the contrast more painfully with the attractive virile young geezer he is unwittingly competing with instead we get an unexpectedly subtle and sympathetic cameo of a lonely clumsy not entirely unlikeable and very human fellow who nevertheless doesn't have much of a clue about entertaining a woman it was around that point i started to sit up and pay more attention here was a script that let the actors breathe and do something interesting with fairly minor parts almost mike leigh in that respect minus the contrived catharses that the latter inexplicably goes in for br br and of course i was as everyone probably was dumbfounded by what anne reid does with her character and with her body she's not the repressed dutiful housewife discovering herself for the first time this is far too simplistic for the character we have again and again there are allusions to her having been a bad housewife not to mention that thing she does with trays trying to look nurturing and comely and only succeeding in looking awkward the daughter accuses her of having sat in front of the tv all day instead of well whatever her motherly duties might be presumed to have been she has no answer she never was a model wife and mother at least not to herself that's where a lot of the poignancy comes from the sense of someone having wasted a life trying to fulfil a role she simply wasn't good at ever
<START> is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television or the media in general as the 1960s no and do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time not really but if we must have one does it have to be as shallow as the '60s br br i like to think that co writers bill couturie and robert greenfield had more in mind for this two part miniseries than what ultimately resulted especially given couturie's involvement in the superb hbo movie dear america letters home from vietnam which utilized little original music and no original footage letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves this presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production but it doesn't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time like so many of its ilk it's seen from the point of view of one family but the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the '60s it's amazing that one of them doesn't go to the rolling stones gig at altamont making it seem less like a period drama and more like a cliff notes version of the decade br br the makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time the children's father is especially clichÃ©d and then when they're back on blammo it's something else garry trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly in fairness jerry o'connell jordana brewster jeremy sisto julia stiles and charles s dutton give their material the old college try but they're wasted especially the latter two it's undeniably good to see david alan grier in a rare straight role as activist fred hampton and rosanna arquette in an uncredited cameo in part 2 is always welcome br br what isn't welcome is how the '60s drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect and this may well be the only time an american tv presentation about post 60s america never mentions the british invasion no beatles no rolling stones then again there's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album right capping its surface skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out of place happy ending american dreams and the wonder years did it all much much better nothing to see here you can't see elsewhere people except for julia stiles doing the twist that is
<START> amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70's and this from leading horror scribe robert bloch is one of their best efforts there are four stories all worthwhile but two sweets for the sweet and method for murder distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys into fear br br in sweets christopher lee plays an impatient widower whose lovely daughter chloe franks becomes resentful of his neglect and brutish intolerance so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her distaste for his methods franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since martin stephens in the innocents this installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage occurring off screen is a moment of purest horror br br method of murder is about a horror novelist denholm elliott who is menaced by one of his own creations the creepy dominic this episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror dominic may or may not be real so director peter duffell has a great time playing with our expectations the brief shots of dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting br br the original poster art featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding peter cushing's severed head was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear
<START> i love julian sands and will at least attempt to watch anything he's in but this movie nearly did me in i'm hard pressed to remember when i found any other movie to move so slow ly zzzzzzzzzzzz br br pop it in the vcr when you've run out of sleeping pills
<START> the premise may seem goofy but since murphy's character doesn't take it seriously it helps ease the audience into this mix of mysticism and modern day hard boiled child abduction excellent cast particularly charles dance and charlotte lewis and murphy is at the height of his 80's peak in comedy action there's also some great f x a very surreal dream sequence and a fairly original plot often overlooked in the pantheon of murphy flicks but this one is worth a look
<START> poor robert englund makes another flop and to the expense of tobe hooper who usually makes pretty good horror movies but he failed pretty bad at this one englund plays the well known marque de sade who in the 17th century was enprisoned for his obsession of pain and the pleasure of bringing pain upon himself as well as watching others also be in pain the story is so confusing with the flip flop from one century to another and i became confused as to what was going on and what was the purpose of this movie all i saw was a young lady that became entrapped by a strange lesbian who desides to keep her to herself and the young lady became fascinated by this arabian with alot of money and finds out that he's out to have her killed and then englund steps in from one century to another claiming to be a descendent of the de sade and tries to kill her because she reminded him of the madam momoselle spelled that wrong or whoever it was in the picture above de sades wall the movie was terrible i am surprised at hooper for hireing englund in this film and the special effects were so fake and laughable especially the part about the eyes englund tries to make a comeback from his once hit move nightmare on elm st by using these pull in and out needles to put out peoples eyes terrible absolutely terrible
<START> music that grinds on the nerves like fingernails on a blackboard acting that is so zombielike it was a shame to waste the cast by not making a second movie casting everyone in it as true zombies with the cast of sabrina the teenaged witch as the heroes a movie so downright awful that if stoners were still around it might be considered a cult movie but oh so amateurish the scripts might as well have been carried around by the actors their lines read as they slowly shuffled through the movie banal illogical sets modeled after la subdivisions props straight from toysrus was a movie ever made that is so completely and totally inept logic flies to the wind in this plodding senseless pointless and with a monster so stupid and uncoordinated that it couldn't catch a turtle in an icebox lowcut leggy and amazon it kept my attention all the way through the way a terrible ongoing chain accident in the fog involving multiple vehicles keeps one watching to the very end as after a ridiculous ray gun fight in a prison on another planet a pneumaticaly disadvantaged sexy and mentally unbalanced bounty hunter chases a retarded extra terrestrial fugitive to earth don't let anybody p s on your popcorn you might actually enjoy watching this one it's that bad
<START> depardieu's most notorious film is this 1974 groundbreaker from bertrand blier it features many highly sexual scenes verging on an x rating including one of jeanne moreau doing a hot 1970s version of her jules and jim menage a trois with the two hairy french hippies depardieu and deware there is no such thing as a sacred territory in this film everything is fair game br br it's very odd that americans tend to not like this film very much while many french people i've met consider it a classic something about it goes against what americans have been programmed to 'like ' br br gerard and the late patrick deware are two bitch slapping hippy drifters with many sexual insecurities going around molesting women and committing petty crimes they're out for kicks and anti capitalist euro commie slacker 'freedom ' blier satirizes the hell out of these two guys while at the same time making bourgeois society itself look ultimately much more ridiculous best of all though is the way the wonderful stephane grappelli score conveys the restless soul of the drifters the deeper subconscious awareness or 'higher ideal' that motivates all the follies they engage in
<START> i think the movie was pretty good will add it to my clasic collection after all this time i believe i saw other posters who reminded some of the pickier people that it is still just a movie maybe some of the more esoteric points defy logic but a great many religious matters accepted on faith fail to pass the smell test if you're going to accept whatever faith you subscribe to you can certainly accept a movie is it just me or has anyone else noticed the aja yee dagger is the same possessed knife lamonte cranston had so much trouble gaining control of in the shadow no mention of it in the trivia section for either movie here imdb but i would bet a dollar to a donut it's the same prop
<START> the summary line above spoken by james cloud robert preston to his brother tom robert sterling just about says it all jim aka kid wichita has a way of making things happen only trouble is he usually leaves dead bodies where he's been not the sort of mentoring tom envisions for younger brother jeff who likes what he sees in jim especially when defending their ranch against local texas cattlemen br br the opening credits state 'introducing john barrymore jr as the younger brother' in this his very first screen appearance that seemed rather odd to me particularly since he was addressed as jeff almost immediately into the story approximately eighteen at the time of this movie he bears a passing resemblance to sean penn no stranger to personal and legal problems throughout his career as well as estrangement from his family i was left wondering if his daughter drew barrymore might have ever seen this picture i'm inclined to think not br br on the subject of resemblances i was also struck by the thought that the young robert sterling looked a bit like roy rogers early in his career knowing sterling previously only from his role as george kerby in the early 1950's tv series 'topper' i thought he looked out of place in a western but that might just be me his character becomes emboldened by his brother's resourcefulness at creating trouble and provides some of the edginess to this not so typical story minor subplots abound including the relationship rancher john gall john litel has with his son the sheriff who kid wichita kills and the troubled marriage between kathleen boyce cathy downs and her husband earl who kid wichita kills chill wills rounds out the main cast as one of tom cloud's hired hands and figures in the somewhat predictable finale br br what's not quite predictable is how things eventually wind up there and for that reason this western earns points for following a less traveled hence not quite as formulaic a plot as a lot of good brother bad brother westerns do combined with the eclectic casting of the principals it's one i'd recommend even if you have to endure some of the jump cuts and sloppy editing that i experienced with my copy
