<START> another reason to watch this delightful movie is florence rice florence who that was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen i soon found out who florence rice was a real beauty who turns in a simply wonderful performance as they all do in this gripping ensemble piece from 1939 its a different time but therein lies the charm it transports you into another world it starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious florence rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine she is absolutely delightful at the same time strong vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie she made over forty movies and i am going to seek out the other thirty nine alan marshal is of the flynn gable mode and proves a perfect match for florence buddy ebsen and una merkel provide some excellent comic moments but the real star is florence rice fans of 30's 40's movies don't miss this one
<START> i saw 'new york i love you' today and loved it i was really looking forward to seeing this after watching 'paris je t'aime' and overall i think i liked this one much better perhaps i need to watch 'paris je t'aime' again i don't know i read few of the reviews here about ny ily and yes the movie is not without its faults when you're paying tribute to a city like new york it can get rather overwhelming and nothing seems fair enough to do the city due justice so without elaborating on any of the film's shortcomings i'll just write about what i liked br br unlike 'paris je t'aime' in which each director's short film was properly segmented and titled ny ily isn't and many reviewers over here have found the seamlessness of stories and overlapping of characters here annoying and even confusing i thought otherwise i loved how the stories just flowed one after the other and i especially liked the overlapping of characters it might be gimmicky because it's done so often in films now but i still liked it because i didn't find it forced and the idea that we're all connected in the end has a wistful even whimsical quality to it which some might find corny but i find beautiful br br i liked all the films but the one that touched me the most was the one by yvan attal with robin wright penn and chris cooper it was so well acted and scripted that the reveal in the end again not unused in the past brought me to tears and i was crying throughout the segment that followed i always liked wright penn and now i'm also a fan of chris cooper those precious initial few seconds when he's standing alone outside the restaurant just before he gets the call speak volumes about cooper's ability to convey a character by just being there without saying anything br br most of the stories in this film involve characters who are either meeting each for the first time or have met each other just recently with the exception of 4 5 stories in which the characters have known each other for a long time it seemed to me and i might be wrong that the stories were different but they were all trying to drive home the point the need even to just step back and view in a new light the people and the things we've known in our lives for a long time to see the people and the things around you with the eyes of a stranger and appreciate them just as you did when you met them and saw them for the first time br br the other films that i liked were the ones by shunji iwai with orlando bloom and christina ricci by natalie portman with carlos acosta and taylor geare by brett ratner with anton yelchin and olivia thirlby by shekhar kapur with julie christie shia labeouf and john hurt and once again the one by yvan attal with ethan hawke and emilie ohana when they're in the cafÃ© i really need to see more work by yvan attal as i seem to like him a lot br br overall watch this movie with an open mind don't read the reviews before watching it it might not live up to your expectations of what a movie on and about love in new york should be and i doubt any movie will really live up to that conception just watch this movie for some good music beautiful landscape cinematography some slice of life comfort and a story or two that might just tug at your heartstrings
<START> redline is a knockoff of fast furious without any of the redeeming qualities it doesn't need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises but it needs something this is the equivalent of a porn film where the storyline and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end except that this is worse because you don't get your money's worth mind numbingly boring impossible race sequences and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this movie sure she's hot but who's that desperate for an on screen female i feel like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets and shook an 8 ball every time they switched scenes no serious person who races or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the race scenes
<START> house of games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels it is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller it is blessed with marvelous performances by lindsay crouse and joe montegna and a strong strong cast of supporting players and it introduces ricky jay card sharp extraordinaire prestidigitator and historian of magic its dialogue written by david mamet is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie in which reality is often in question an extra dimension of unrealness br br on the face of it house of games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men diametrically different from the sting which was played merely for glamour and yuks at this level it does succeed admirably br br however you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization the only movie i know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated private benjamin that thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of goldie hawn to chase after some easy laughs house of games sticks to its business as poe once said of a good short story it drives relentlessly to its conclusion br br there is another strain of movies about women epitomized by thelma and louise a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed whether or not they realize their inner strengths what tripe br br as usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater it should be a natural for film festivals nominate it for one near you if you get the chance br br i bought the original version of house of games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter better she should see it on a tv than not at all
<START> i cannot believe the same guy directed this crap and dracula 2000 dracula 2000 was innovative fresh and well written if poorly acted br br this pile can't even claim that it starts with the defeat of dracula at the end of dracula 2000 then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that following the narrative properly could have made this a good sequel somehow but craven chose to go in the style of his older films having no good tie but the main villain's name br br even the actor playing dracula was different going from dark hair in dracula 2000 to a blonde here br br avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies
<START> overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come although the plot is not 100 accurate to the book most everything is correct the movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts i found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie because i hadn't found out about the movie yet but later i found the movie in a bargain bin at wal mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what i had expected overall i give this movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts relative accuracy and overall making sense and for its bad parts large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies
<START> to review this movie i without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in tarantino's pulp fiction 1994 when jules and vincent are talking about mia wallace and what she does for a living jules tells vincent that the only thing she did worthwhile was pilot vincent asks what the hell is a pilot and jules goes into a very well description of what a tv pilot is well the way they make shows is they make one show that show's called a 'pilot' then they show that show to the people who make shows and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows some pilots get picked and become television programs some don't become nothing she starred in one of the ones that became nothing now to stretch on what jules was talking about there are billions of television shows pilots that were never aired because they simply were not well good probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is w a l t e r a spin off to m a s h with gary radar burghoff as the lead hmmm would somebody really want to be watching radar for a half hour trying to solve crimes hence the show was never picked up what many people don't know or what they thought they knew is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air for they are made strictly for the television networks for them to decide some have made they're way past and got onto the air the pilot for the animated series american dad comes to mind as the show's serial itself didn't begin until nearly four months later however there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air and this here is why br br black bart a supposed tie in with the mel brooks comedy classic blazing saddles is a stale and bland sitcom with little heart and no soul saddles was a controversial comedy nevertheless with it's racist humor and vulgar comedy which comes to mind what idiot decided this would make a great television show for prime time tv i say supposed because none of the memorable characters from the movie aside from bart on in this mess of a tv show mel brooks wasn't even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line in a related story i recently found out about an unaired tv pilot for a series based on the movie clerks that kevin smith was no involved in you see what happens br br set somewhere around the same time as the movie or at all the story circles around the only black sheriff in the wild west named appropriately 'black' bart who is this time played by future academy award winner louis gossett jr obviously before his stint in real acting whereas in this he is playing a g rated richard pryor most of the other characters are carbon if not really bad copies of the characters in the movie jim the waco kid is replaced by a similar looking character named reb jordan a former confederate soldier who is quick with the gun lilian von schtupp is now belle buzzer a more of a ripoff of the character being that she's a show dancer and a german with a marlene dietrich type accent and personality while that's pretty much the end in similarities the lead bad guy in the story is fern malaga played by noble willingham who i assumed would've been hedley lamar if warner bros secured the rights to the name see trivia for blazing saddles and his son curley i dunno taggart i suppose the story is a poor excuse for a sitcom much less a pilot bart deals with the mayor's drunk son and he's out of control behavior which has caused the town to spin really it's a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the series and doesn't focus on the variety and context that would make this an alright show i can't really call it a sitcom and even if i wanted to and that's primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at warner bros studios and later added a laugh track so the show is set up almost exactly like m a s h complete with a bland and dull laughing that is identical to the series the acting is so so but there's one part that always make me laugh and that's when the actor playing reb jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue ha the script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie surprisingly they use the word n er numerous amount of times through a 22 minute episode rather touchy for it's time period and even for today and it gets repetitive br br if you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of sssss surly interesting novelty item watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots it's on the collector's edition of blazing saddles god knows why there yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie in pilots never air
<START> coming of age movies are quite usual these days for 1980 foxes really gives its meaning jodie foster plays her character straight out ever since she did taxi driver four years earlier she has a stronger character in this movie she's jeanie a high schooler who has plenty of guts and seems to get out of any situation she's in scott baio plays brad way before chachi on happy days he's deemed immature by the other girls cherie currie is annie hangs with the wrong crowd chased by her policeman father jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous annie is rescued by jeanie and brad all the time whenever she gets wasted reality comes back hard where she is killed in a automobile accident and one gets married to a much older man growing up isn't easy sometimes we got to explore life how it is in reality you got to be careful about the people surrounding you for me i was my own person and i tend to stay that way great music great plot this movie's a gem 4 out of 5 stars
<START> i guess if a film has magic i don't need it to be fluid or seamless it can skip background information go too fast in some places too slow in others etc magic in this film the scene in the library there are many minor flaws in stanley iris yet they don't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible the hardest to fix both characters are smart yet stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood iris although well educated hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the u turn her life took in both their faults and strengths the characters compliment each other it may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an iris would wind up working year after year in a factory or that a stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better paying job and while these mysteries are explained in the course of the story their unfolding seems somewhat contrived i assume no one took the time to rethink the script even so it's a good movieÂjust imagine what de niro fonda and plimpton would have done on screen if someone had
<START> in the u s very few films have been made about rome that were not set in the time of julius caesar or shortly thereafter hollywood's sword and sandal epics mostly have a christian theme which makes it difficult to get into earlier roman history spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and encountered some resistance in hollywood because it did not have jesus in it br br it's interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of caesar and christ but is set when rome was only one city among many on the italian peninsula and had just ousted the hated king tarquin and formed the republic br br however this is not a historical film it's peplum and while the production values aren't rock bottom the acting and characterizations are cardboard i can only imagine what the dialogue was like in italian but with wooden english dubbing it's very campy i got a few good laughs out of it at first br br i haven't seen many films of this genre having missed most of the hercules movies of the 60s it's amusing up to a point but as the film goes on it gets somewhat boring br br one thing's for sure if i'd seen this movie when i was ten years old i would have loved it at that age i went for anything with romans and swordfights in it so at least this flick brought back some childhood memories
<START> man i loved this movie this really takes me back to when i was a kid these were the days when the teachers still showed classroom films on reel to real and if you were good they would rewind the movie slowly so you could watch it play backward i still remember one of the opening lines tutazema was his name and he was an orphan he lived with his sister so and so in the village this is a great movie for kids and as enduring as the red balloon at the end the other indian boys in the village attach the feathers to tutazema and he becomes an eagle himself he gets to live the way he always wanted to he gets to soar the heavens
<START> bertrand blier is indeed l'enfant terrible of french cinema and in the seventies he always could shock the public filmed with his fave duo depardieu and dewaere and the usual dose of sex miou miou plays her typical role at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best french actress ever in first les valseuses is also one of the first roadmovies as the viewer is just taken to some journeys of two little criminals those who only are satisfied with family life or simply know nothing more the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that it just let you think of all the usual things in life working for the car being bounded at work etc it's a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society we're living in great job and it just makes you wish two things dewaere died just too young as he was a topactor and of course depardieu he'd better should have stuck with french movies as he proves here that no one can beat him timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock some
<START> a woman sylvia kristel seduces a 15 year old boy eric brown they have sex but it's all tied into some stupid plot or something br br easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation i suppose it's ok cause it's a teenage boy if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would rightfully be outrage sorry but having it done to a boy doesn't excuse it it's still sick i realize brown was of age he was actually 18 when this was made but he looks 15 i just find it disturbing that some people find this ok br br plot aside the acting sucks kristel is beautiful but can't act brown is easily one of the worst child actors i've ever seen and the constant nudity gets boring and isn't even remotely erotic br br i saw this drivel at a theatre back in 1981 i was 19 and with my 14 year old cousin who could easily pass for 18 he wanted to see it i didn't but i decided what the heck we got in and i actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage my cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through let me make this clear three teenage boys left a movie with tons of female nudity that should give you an idea of how bad this is i'm surprised this was ever released a 1 all the way
<START> i normally only write reviews for movies i really hated or really liked and as you can probably tell from the number of stars up there i didn't like it by now i assume you have read about the plot or maybe even seen the movie so i'll skip the summary let's break this down pros and cons br br cons the concept the premise was set up to be interesting using chaos theory as a theme was interesting however it wasn't carried out so well correct me if i'm wrong but it seems to me that chaos theory was kind of misrepresented the event that occurred in the movie seemed more like contrived coincidence than anything i guess the butterfly effect was represented by the whole god s causes tsunami to bring back statue the presentation comes off as really sloppy though some people call this intelligent but it just seems to be another souped up action film br br storyline is it just me or does it seem that kamal just threw this together to give him an excuse to play ten roles the plot is extremely contrived govind kept losing the vial so many times in obscure accidents his friend just happens to mix up the vial with a package he was sending to india a crazy old lady just happens to throw the vial into an idol half the cast just happens to unexpectedly meet up in the same hospital and the case with the idol just happened to get mixed up with one that belonged to a famous singer br br cgi oh god the cgi it was even worse than the special effects in jaws 3 and those sucked right away i could tell which parts were animated even my ten year old cousin knows that underwater cars don't look like that br br stunts yes i now that action scenes in tamil movies aren't realistic but the stunts in this one were horrid and actually distracted me from the story br br make up i have to admit they did a better job than expected i thought kamal would be playing people with similar skin tones so the two fake white guys and the fake japanese aikido guy caught me off guard however it was still pretty bad i could easily tell which ones were wearing masks br br the songs the music was distracting and out of place in many instances br br asin her character was possibly the most annoying one in the movie she was loud ditsy and obsessed irrationally about that idol i actually found myself wishing she would die br br plot holes and fridge logic let me get this straight a lab monkey was smart enough to get past a password locked door but not intelligent enough to tell the difference between a bar of chocolate and a vial with a deadly virus in it and then an ex cia agent who's after the vial figures out it's headed for india instead of immediately following it he marries a pole dancer first a famous punjabi singer with cancer checks into a small town hospital in the third world when he could easily afford the best medical treatment available furthermore he gets shot in the throat with a bullet you'd think he would be killed but instead the magic bullet has cleared his tumor you read that right a bullet knocked out the tumor br br pros the naidu character possibly the only likable part of the movie was his comedy
<START> we so often talk of cinema landmarks kane the godfather a bout de souffle one film however is too often overlooked by serious film critics i am talking of course about the classic doc savage m o b br br this film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us imperialism not to mention kung fu br br it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history until of course queen's breathtaking work on flash gordon although a bit of a rarity this film is well worth seeking out it will repay the effort of your search ten fold
<START> hines and goforth the perpetrators of this crime begin on the wrong foot first step by assuming that wells wrote gothic horror and that all of his lines are meant to be taken seriously that simply isn't true wells was very much an inheritor of the enlightenment and his main concern was that victorian self satisfaction might leave the british unprepared for the world the new technology could produce both the good and the bad br br two terrible consequences follow the protagonist is portrayed as a wimpy screamer i was reminded of fay wray in the original king kong rather than a man struggling to live out the ironies of an unbelievable catastrophe and the dialog reeks of 'victorianisms' uttered seriously that welles clearly meant to be taken tongue in cheek br br all of this looks suspiciously like ed wood with an enormous budget to waste on cgi effects which by the way are so poorly accomplished the warner bros cartoon factory of the 1940s could have done a better job gobs of spattered blood looked like red balloons i expected them to float away any minute think the yellow submarine as done by the old ec comics br br worse yet is the loss of theme which robs the film of any reason to exist although the makers of this film return the story to its victorian era they utterly miss the uncanny way wells' story predicted many of the horrors of the first world war a fact not unnoticed by wells himself who after the war reworked the theme in the shape of things to come br br without any theme all we have here are a lot of people running around getting blasted into cartoon balloons when they're not trying out for a high school production of a drunken student's rewrite of macbeth br br really this is the worst most senseless piece of drivel i have suffered through since a friend talked me into seeing the eastern european cartoon fantastic planet thirty years ago that film was so pretentiously dull my friend and i and two total strangers gave up ridiculing it about half way through and sat near the screen playing cards using the movie as light by which to see the cards its only usefulness as far as any of us could tell br br but i already have electric lighting in my apartment so i didn't need this put down of wells for anything br br do not avoid this film steal every copy you can don't pay a cent and burn each and every one of them god in his wisdom created us just for this purpose
<START> i cannot believe how uneducated this movie is it's like watching police academy except it's with people that have no clue of what they are talking about and wait there is a stupid robot that is supposed to be a sidekick i can understand suspension of disbelief but this is just complete stupidity not only is there no plot to this movie it's like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor throw non medical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility plus the people are wearing clothes that are un befitting for a space program i feel like i'm watching a valley girls b movie in space
<START> cavemen was by far the biggest load of crap i have ever wasted my time watching this show based on the geico commercials is less entertaining then an actual 30 sec ad for geico the makeup was half ass ed to say the least hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after going to the dentist this show could of had potential for a funny series if they could of gotten the cast from the commercials that in it self makes for a lousy show perhaps if the writers were the same from the geico ads this may of had a chance instead the pilot lacked a good story line i give this show a 1 out of 10 i would of liked to put a zero out of 10 but that was not an option i pray for a quick death to this show i'd give it less then 5 episodes before it dies a deserving death
<START> based upon the recommendation of a friend my wife and i invited another couple to this film i really apologized to them all 4 of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end half the vignettes are bizarre with very little entertainment value there were few scenes of paris for example i was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the latin quarter but i couldn't really recognize anything most of the scene was inside a bar no one in the theater laughed at anything or reacted in any way if you like bizarre pretentious pseudo intellectual films don't miss this if you are down to earth like me you will be sorry you saw it
<START> after seeing the batman dead end short i didn't know what to really expect from world's finest of course superman and batman all my world's finest comic books have them as the team up br br after seeing this 3 and a half minute trailer it made me wish someone would make a serialized fan film for world's finest if not an actual full length film br br sure some of the superman stuff was cheesy but movie trailers in theaters are always teasers giving you only certain aspects of the entire product this looks like it needs a complete product br br other than director sandy collera's relative playing an achingly poor perry white most of the actors were unknown if an actual movie was made actors would be cast to fit the bill for the film though i believe nina kaczorowski would make a good lois lane especially if given closer to the character dialogue br br good to see clark bartram wearing the batman costume from dead end but it should be updated a bit more and not be like the 40s batman with the 80s 90s leather cape and cowl his demeanor is batman like but i still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just allowing his eyes to show through the mask i believe the goal was to get it as close to the comic character than the movie persona br br michael o'hearn cannot play superman period he stands around with a goofy look on his face that simply says slap me and line delivery seems to be a problem with him br br overall though i would love to see a complete story and film based on this ingenious piece of work there was a rumor about a world's finest movie being made and with the correct additions to the script this could be it hope more like this are made
