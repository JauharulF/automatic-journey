<START> the championship game is only a couple of days away but things in new orleans aren't as they should be from players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable wonderful time can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined br br despite what you might think when you first read about superdome this is not a football movie in fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought instead superdome is another of those lousy soap opera ish 70s made for tv movies populated with hollywood has beens and those that never will be the cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good the best or worst example is van johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he's there the plot is dull uninteresting and unbelievable donna mills as a hit man yeah right it's about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked david jansen the movie also lacks any pace trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow superdome might have had with no drama or suspense in sight superdome ends up being a very poor example of a 70s made for tv movie the lone highlight for me was the voice over work from the late charlie jones a sportscaster i miss listening to the eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over hypes the atmosphere in new orleans is pure cheese at its finest br br like most others who have seen superdome i also did so courtesy of mystery science theater 3000 it may be one of the ktma public access episodes but it's one of the best examples of the shows early start so even though i've only rated superdome a 2 10 i'll give this episode a generous 3 5 on my mst3k rating scale
<START> i saw this director's woman on the beach and could not understand the good to great reviews this film is much like that one two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else like his other films you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten pretty uninteresting characters if you feel you can like this film don't let my review stop you i do like minimalism in films but i feel tsai ming liang's films are far superior he has a fairly terrific actor in lee kang sheng in his films there is nothing here i wish iu liked it but i don't oh well
<START> this is the worst and i mean the worst computers based movie i have ever seen the whole plot is totally unconvincing and full of stupidity br br i mean br br the guy in this movie can actually speak with computer as a real person now you probably think this must be some super cool high tech computer well it is but he does it also with other very poor and weak computer which does not even have graphic interface br br and the main idea how to overload the super computer by connecting to it via computer game on the net is really stupid my mobile phone will shut the lighting down to preserve the energy but apparently this genius computer cant decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to load computer games br br there are also some other bad things about it but i just don't have time for this br br i just cant believe someone could actually record movie stupid as this
<START> ok this is the third in the series of carnosaur lets star with the dinosaur puppets in the start of the film you cant see the dino's cause when the body count starts you can only see the dino's eye vision pretty smart to hide the bad puppets and maybe in 16 minutes forward on the film some special force team with scott valentine as the leader rance the team walks into the warehouse and then they begins to find body parts and dead body's after the dino rampage after a while some big box comes failing on the team and you can hear a velociraptor scream pretty creepy and then a black girl walks forward and now one blooper is found it pops up a raptor hand and slashed her face but if you pause when the raptor hand comes you can see that its just a guy with a hand puppet wtf the story is simple 1 some terrorist's attacks some truck cause they though it wash some weapons in there 2 they where dead wrong it seams to be ten tons raptor and one giant t rex in there how did the t rex fit in there 3 rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs sadly some stupid blond girl told him to capture one of them alive 4 holy jesues the raptors have wheels on their feats 5 the dino's is now on a boat in the pacific 6 strange i didn't know that the t rex had a strange thing on hes neck 7 the end the film is good if you want a good laugh 5 10
<START> my wife and i took our 13 year old son to see this film and were absolutely delighted with the winsome fun of the film it has extra appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood but even women enjoy the film and especially hallie kate eisenberg's refrain boys are so weird it's refreshing to see a film that unapologetically shows that boys and girls are indeed different in their emotional and social makeup boys really do these kinds of strange things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers silly we enjoyed the film so much that my son and an 11 year old friend myself and my daughters 23 year old boyfriend went to see the movie the next day for a guys day out we had even more fun the second time around and everyone raved about it it's clean and delightfully acted by a pre adolescent cast reminiscent of the tv classic freaks and geeks we all feel it will become a sleeper hit not unlike the freaks geeks which didn't survive its first season but sold out its dvd release do see it especially if you have boys and you'll find it stimulates conversation about fun and safety girls will love it because of the opportunity it affords to say boys are so weird don't miss it
<START> an attempt at crossover to appeal to those who don't appreciate opera exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time it fails badly all that is desirable in this movie is the opera and one can best find a recording of pavarotti doing what he does best the plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome br br only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten like most opera stars pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence aside from his singing talent and nothing that he does in this movie negates that opinion his culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script perhaps because great operas can have silly stories he tolerated this one br br who knows except those involved do we need to know br br the plot is weak and trite this movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits the opera music hanging above the mud we have other ways in which to appreciate the great pavarotti and this one isn't one of them just get one of his many superb opera or vocal concert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is most suited br br it would be one of imdb's 100 worst films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers actors models and athletes to exploit their popularity through film very often it all goes badly wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice however effective he is as an actor opera requires it not even jimmy stewart could have rescued this turkey of a script br br i give it a polite 3 of 10 because someone may have become a fan of pavarotti's singing and of opera because of this movie
<START> this movie was great it was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth the animation was somewhat odd but nothing new from disney it was definitely better than expected for a disney movie with no singing br br the background animation was magical it was a different level of work for the disney people some of the characters were a little boxy but it was more than made up for with the beauty and lushness of the scenery the music was largely instrumental but that was perfect for the movie this was definitely not a film that needed the characters to bust into song br br perfect 10 out of 10
<START> i saw only the first part of this series when it debuted back in the late 90's and only recently got a chance to watch all three parts via netflix convenient service by the way all in all i liked this lighthearted sometimes genre challenged mini series the story of a younger man falling for an older woman seems to work and the actors are all fine yes it does have some romance clichÃ©s of running in the rain or a train station goodbye but the characters have a chance to be explored so it doesn't seem cheesy like it would be if this were some tom hanks vehicle or similar robson greene who at times reminds me of a separated at birth scott bakula does a fine job of someone who is head over heels in love and the ebb and tide of desire and rejection throws the series into watchable fare personally i think the series could have been done with two episodes but that's up for debate i suppose apparently there's a sequel and that should be arriving tomorrow via netflix
<START> chinese ghost story is one of the most amazing hong kong films i have ever seen it's a brilliant mix of fantasy comedy romance horror and martial arts the film has some wonderful visuals and amazing fights i love especially the fight scene between wu ma and the tree demon tongue truly original and refreshing film and another embalmer's fine recommendation
<START> now don't get me wrong if you need an insightful summary of everything that been wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a flawless path to brighter future for mankind who better to turn to than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture if you need a healthy dose of all the solid sound reasons why religion has outlived it's usefulness then turn to sagan or dawkins not bill maher for god's sake that's a good point in and of itself maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society art and science is rooted in it br br in this film he relies heavily on his keenly honed skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear erudite and wise unfortunately his intellect isn't up to the task br br maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box as an example he responds to an interviewee's and i use the term loosely as they were clearly all ambushees assertion that the existence of jesus is historical fact with a deadpan no it's not followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the subject's naivety a device nauseatingly overused in this film the problem is that the person was correct and maher dead wrong in his assertion that jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically suspect gospels i guess mr maher has never read the contemporary historian josephus br br but the masses will flock to this pseudo documentary as they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like michael moore and they will loudly bray and guffaw they certainly did at my showing br br it's doubly telling however that the loudest and most mule like braying occurred during the approximately 70 of the running time that the film devoted to it's anti christian tirade while the audience was wholly mute during the token 10 devoted to criticizing the self described religion of peace hmmm either criticism of islam is off limits to the hip and liberal target audience or they were just afraid to laugh very telling either way
<START> the last couple of weeks in the life of a dead vagabond woman is told in flashbacks like the vagabond the film wanders aimlessly and rather pointlessly mona the lazy sullen and drug addicted title character is not likable and bonnaire does little to make her interesting although there is some pretentious dialog attempting to explain why mona has chosen this miserable lifestyle her motivations are never really clear the episodic nature of the film involving some random characters becomes tiresome after a while making it seem much longer than its running time it is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not draw more attention from men
<START> the cast is excellent the acting good the plot interesting the evolvement full of suspense but it is hard to cram all those elements into a film that is barely 80 minutes long if more time was taken to develop the plot and subplots it would have a much better effect another 30 minutes of substance would have made this a very good film rather then just a good one
<START> deanna durbin really did save universal from bankruptcy and enabled it to remain a big studio by the mid 30s most of the big directors that had been at universal eg milestone browning and wyler had gone only james whale remained but his prestigious horror films were behind him deanna and judy garland appeared in a short every sunday and initially garland was suggested for the role of penny in three smart girls when garland was unavailable universal switched to durbin initially she had been definitely a supporting player but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to make her the star directed by henry koster the film had a european touch br br the film starts with a beautiful panorama of a lake in switzerland the three smart girls of the title three sisters joan nan grey kay barbara read and penny deanna durbin are sailing with penny giving her glorious voice to my heart is singing all is not too well on the home front their father is planning to remarry a younger woman binnie barnes so the three girls with the help of their trusty nurse lucille watson decide to go to new york and reunite him with their mother lucille watson is best remembered for her role as robert taylor's stern mother in waterloo bridge 1941 br br donna is a gold digger who along with her scatty mother alice brady is determined to marry judson craig charles winninger for someone with no film experience deanna is wonderful as penny a typical pesky over enthusiastic kid sister and she is as pretty as a picture when she sings someone to care for me to her father you will just melt what a glorious voice she had she also has one of the funniest lines in the film when her father consoles her with i'll take you to the zoo tomorrow she replies oh i can see enough monkeys around here br br with the help of bill evans john king they decide to hire a count mischa auer to romance donna they arrange to meet at a nightclub but due to a mix up lord michael stuart ray milland is mistaken for the count and donna falls for him she thinks he owns half of australia the plan backfires as he falls for kay and donna wants to hasten her marriage to judson br br penny decides to take matters into her own hands and runs away she is taken to the local police station where she charms the cops with her rendition of il bacio she is trying to convince them she is a young opera singer everything ends happily with their mother nella walker sailing over to patch things up with their dad and in the meantime donna makes the acquaintance of the phoney count mischa auer and sails off to australia with him br br highly recommended
<START> there is a certain genius behind this movie i was laughing throughout the scene in the phone sex office discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius humor execution is poor but you can see the writer's message and they do have some talent the doppelganger split at the end was like ok wasn't quite expecting that but let's see what the movie has to say certainly ridiculous but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way br br is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level i'm easily bored by many movies but this one kept my interest throughout br br i think the story may have some auto biographical roots but that's just a guess horribly bad but good i'm looking for other movies this person may have done with more experience
<START> 'presque rien' is a story of two young boys falling in love during summer stay by the seaside i don't want to tell the plot because it's not what's most important about this film but you can be sure that it's interesting and original the best part of this movie is the cinematography the visual side of 'presque rien' is so amazing it deserves highest note it leaves you charmed with its beauty br br as for the plot it is shown in uneven rather complicated way there is no simple chronology nor there are answers to all the questions the film brings but this is what makes 'presque rien' even more interesting i recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed
<START> an interesting look at japan prior to opening to the west john wayne as america's first consul to japan arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from perry's gunboat diplomacy he is not welcome wayne eventually wins his meeting with the shogun after bring a cholera epidemic introduced by an american ship under control there follows a colorful procession to the capital bearing gifts for the shogun including a bottle of old tanglefoot the meeting with the shogun the debates among the japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an interesting look at the politics of the period altogether a rather enjoyable movie and besides how often do you get to see the duke lose a fight to a guy half his size
<START> to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue the budget the this and the that who wants to hear it if you missed the point of this beyond beautiful movie that's your loss the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life and this one stands in its own entity in my book it was not supposed to be a documentary or a completely factual account of what happened that night it is the most amazing love story ever attempted i know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy but come on someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money how lame is that it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet and is the top grossing film in the planet i will gladly side with the majority this time around okay cynics time to crawl back under your rock i am done
<START> this movie has a few things going for it right off the bat having dani filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie admittedly i love cradle of filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before i watched it dani filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead the independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor there are some gorgeous actresses in this movie for being low budget the special effects weren't bad either the ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish br br now on to the cons there is very little talking throughout this whole movie thus making for very little as far as character development it's hard to fear for the lives of limp static characters when there was a little talking the f bomb was abundant popping up in random places yes i understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language the storyline what i could make out of it was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what's happening br br in the end cradle of fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline it just doesn't work too well rent it though if you're a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite
<START> me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs s i c k is one of the better horror but funny movie we've rented the plot is over done the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very old the goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat and if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to cartoon network for the rest of their life it's pathetic the good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie the other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry i don't like watching horrible acting or renting these horrible videos i don't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth renting unless you are too mature to laugh at someone's downfalls i would recommend it br br if your renting buying it to laugh at it i'd give it an 8 5
<START> this movie has no plot no character development and no budget it really sucks to put it in short terms since there is no development for the movie it really can't even be looked as trying to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture which leaves two other reasons to possibly watch it to be shocked or to get off on it like a sick little freak well it falls short here too the girl's reactions just seem dumb it's extremely easy to tell that it's fake honestly professional wrestling looks more realistic than the crap they try to get by with in this movie they throw innards on her but she's asleep for most of it so it's just kinda dumb the only really kind of worthwhile part is the end when they quickly cut from scene to scene just before the needle goes into her eye but honestly the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake with the exception of the eye if you want a good movie about torture go watch hostel and hostel 2 not only do they both contain realistic violence but there is also an actual storyline that draws you in and makes you care about the people plus the tow movies really work on a deeper level considering themes like american fears of foreigners issues of morality testing how far a person can go human instincts vs civilization and many other things plus they are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story isn't focused on the violence these are much better choices over this piece of crap
