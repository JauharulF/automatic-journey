<START> and when i watch sarah silverman i get the same results i love quirky irreverent humor but this woman is so darned b o r i n g annoying and yawn worthy she's also totally lacking in anything whatsoever humorous the deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because she's just not funny i watched two segments of her program and was ready for novocaine br br geez my kid age 19 saw her promos on comedy central and said she was a dumb chick i thought that was a compliment the one where she says watch my show or i'll kill my dog is actually believable i know she's a wanna be comedienne she just comes across as a warped nut case i just don't ever want to see her around my dog
<START> this film was seen by my wife and i when it came out in 1978 it was a revelation to us we actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children obviously we were wrong love may come from where you don't expect it and maybe don't want it but we both chose that love anyway br br and no it never changed our sexual orientation that kind of stuff is for the christian wackos br br when we were young we both had affairs but never with the opposite sex as we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs br br this story is not far fetched however the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last 40 years we are still gay end of story
<START> 1st watched 2 28 2006 4 out of 10 dir sydney pollack dvd version i watched titled 3 days of the condor so so cia drama full of laid back performances making for a very laid back movie the premise of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 members of a cia research group being killed with robert redford's character codename condor being the one that was left who killed them and why that's what redford tries to find out while trying to not be the 8th victim at the same time along the way he gets faye dunaway's character involved involved originally because he needs a place to hide and then she eventually helps him out after a little lovey dovey time this is one of a handful of innocent guy on the run stories but this one doesn't have a lot of suspense the flat performances don't help and the finish doesn't seal the deal for the audience enough either despite having a good director in sydney pollack and a group of classic performers the story and the performances are not what they should be and therefore the movie is not what it should be
<START> this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment its the best ending of any movie i've ever seen perfect beautiful funny simply wonderful br br i found this movie delightful even with it's french taking itself too seriously deep meanings thing going on i loved it it's a great love story and i loved the way algerians were woven in and by the way the music during the final credits is great i want the cd
<START> i have watched anime but i'm not a die hard fan and i don't read manga i say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background i have seen st john's wort and although it isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination it made me pick up shinobi especially since everyone seems to love it br br well i watched it this afternoon and fought very hard to keep watching yes it's very beautiful the slow motion water scenes the autumn leaves on the trees even the cgi eye flicker majestic i liked the hawk the costumes even some of the fight scenes but overall this was dull as dirt br br it seemed as if someone took romeo and juliet the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers and threw in some x men for good measure two of the characters split wolverine's powers the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the grey haired guy had his ability to heal himself then you have the girl who has a poison kiss that's poison ivy from batman why do they give these women such dumb powers poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death man that's some great power for you and the other girl can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands the other woman one of the star crossed lovers has the power of a hypnotic stare wow br br i sort of made it to the end of the film by fast forwarding it and did see a bit more tragedy than i expected some people are comparing this to house of flying daggers and hero don't make that mistake they may share similar endings but that's where the similarities end shinobi is made by an amateur the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker br br i would say avoid this film unless you're 12 to 18 years old
<START> i managed to tape this off my satellite but i would love to get an original release in a format we can use here in the states eddie truly is glorious in this performance from san francisco i don't remember laughing so hard at a stand up routine my wife and i both enjoyed this tape and his work on glorious i just wish i could buy a copy and help support eddie financially through my purchase we need more of his shows available
<START> i second the motion to make this into a movie it would be great i was also amazed at the storyline and character build in this game i have played it again and again over 20 times just to try something different and it gets more interesting every time final fantasy eat your heart out this should be made into a movie if anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to have this made into a movie please contact me i would love to help with that project any day the graphics are great for ps1 and even make you forget it is ps1 most of the time the multitude of side quests makes it different every time you play
<START> in addition to being an extremely fun movie may i add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful this kind fun loving woman had a great deal of money unfortunately she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money this woman was lonely since the death of her husband he had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down to prevent that she bought it her daughters were afraid she was throwing away their money and decided to take action the character actors in this film were a great plus also i would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library but as of yet it's never been released sad
<START> solid comedy entertainment with musical interludes it generates a fast pace that carries proceedings along in zestful tempo through a maze of humorous and chiller complications boris karloff bela lugosi and peter lorre form a strong setup of sinister villainy the script contains all the standard mystery film props sliding panels secret passageways thunder and lightning and poisoned blow darts karloff lugosi and lorre go in for heavy leers and obvious melodramatics of the gaslit era kay kyser and his band offered great entertainment for the people living in the 1940's who were trying to forget about the horror's of world war ii
<START> an absolute classic the direction is flawless the acting is just superb words fall short for this great work the most definitive movie on mumbai police this movie has stood the test of times br br om puri gives a stellar performance smita patil no less all the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment this movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society br br this is the story of a cop om puri who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer the first attempt in bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about mumbai cops kudos to nihalani br br after this movie a slew of bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal politician police nexus thus this movie was truly a trend setter this trend dominated the hindi movie scene for more than a decade br br this movie was a moderate box office hit br br a must see for discerning movie fans
<START> overall this is a delightful light hearted romantic musical comedy i suppose a small case could be made for the movie being to long but i'm not sure what you would cut out the singing that kelly and sinatra do no the fabulous dancing that kelly does no the time the movie takes to develop the story line and develop the relationships of the characters no that seems to be a common complaint many times that more recent movies don't develop the characters br br some comment that iturbi didn't bring much to the movie but this gives us a chance to see and hear a great talent from the 1040s so what if he wasn't an actor he was an important part of the movie as the basic plot was to get grayson an audition with him br br originally katherine grayson wanted to be an opera star louis b mayer brought her to mgm for a screen test that included an aria during her audition in the movie there is a shot of the mgm brass nodding and smiling you can just imagine it was like that when she had made her real screen test years before br br this movie is so full of life it is hard to hit all of the highlights great use was made of color and lighting throughout the movie you can see why frank sinatra became the star he did a nice counter point in the movie is how sinatra a ladies man even then played the role of wanting to just find a date while on leave you'll feel good after seeing this movie 7 10
<START> i wanted to like this film yes its a saw blah blah blah ripoff but i like those films if done well this had all the ingredients of being a good not brilliant but good film unfortunately those ingredients had gone off the acting was terrible and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one hoods taken off the remarks and one liners are just terrible yes i know bad writing but this is more than that it was bad writing coupled with bad acting two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film br br sorry im even wondering why i am bothering to review this movie at all br br i will end with plot holes plot holes more plot holes disappointing
<START> man this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books frankly i found it too slow and unappealing right from the start i kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened this movie is vastly overrated br br shakespeare with the king james english has never appealed to me anyway so it may just be me there is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show ronald colman playing the role of othello br br the good points of the film include thanks to a restored print some decent cinematography and a young slim and attractive shelly winters br br overall this is simply too boring too much repetition in some of the scenes to watch again besides we all know that most actors are nut cases anyway but kudos to hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story
<START> the people who are bad mouthing this film are those who don't understand film to begin with these are the people who love movie blockbusters and adverse to any movie that doesn't star leonardo dicaprio wilder napalm is a neat little film that may seem quirky and maybe even stupid at first but what it lacks in plot it more than makes up for in substance br br one thing in particular about the movie that impressed me was it's use of music which plays a large part those students of film music will notice how important music is in the movie both in vida and wilder's life and in the background wilder's theme vida's theme and wallace's theme are all heard in the opening sequence and it is funny how some of the lyrics play out for instance in the scene where the men are singing duke of earl vida is with wilder when the men sing something like she is my girl and then she goes over to wallace to give him something when the men sing the lyric she will be my girl cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers there are all sorts of little intricacies like this inside the movie and while it may look like a flop on the outside the real student of film will notice how good this movie really is
<START> if you need cheering up on a cold weekday evening this is the film for you excellent script and perfectly cast actors i especially loved ray psyching himself up in front of the mirror before gigs inspired
<START> this series was just like what you would expect from mr spielberg it is truly one of those frighting funny childish shows that you won't forget just like outer limits another great show this little series does what not a lot can it was great and deserved to run longer it was a great show that even kids could watch though some of the shows were a little scary when they wanted to be but all of them always had a moral at the end like the twilight zone that made you realize what situation you didn't want to end up in or ones that you did i remember watching some of these on sci fi when i was 10 and even now i still enjoy seeing them when i can truly a fun imaginative show i loved it and still do
<START> great entertainment from start to the end wonderful performances by belushi beach dalton railsback some twists and many action scenes the movie was made for me funny lines in the screenplay good music dalton as the tough sheriff and railsback as redneck villain i must recommend this film to every action adventure fan 10 10
<START> this chinese movie made me feel so many similarities with members of a culture i don't belong and are far from in an almost buddhist approach the film helps one to relate to each character and to the happiness of doing the simple routine things br br all actors are brilliant and xu hzu exudes kindness and wisdom yet also vulnerable and mean er min the retarded brother shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal and that wisdom comes to and from the most disparate persons in this universe a different china this is far from the chinese realism yet it has lots of humanity and realism of a different kind br br get it you won't be disappointed
<START> i agree whole heartedly with the comments so far i remember this documentary as being one of the most amazing and informative i've ever seen as stated before i recall that i began watching thinking it was just another nature study interesting not necessarily special but i was so wrong not only was the story of the colony incredible but i remember the music as being so much a part of it's appeal if i remember correctly it was native americn pipes akin to the music at the end of one flew over the cookoo's nest i too have been looking for a copy this should be required watching for anybody but especially the schools it should be re released
<START> this movie was disaster at box office and the reason behind that is innocence of the movie sweetness of the story music was good story is very simple and old but presentation of such story is very good director tried his best abhay is excellent and impressive and he shines once again in his role he did his best in comedy or in emotional scene soha looks so sweet in the movie rest star cast was simply okay music and all songs are good himesh is impressive as an singer here don't miss this movie its a wonderful movie and a feel good one for us abhay best work till date i will give 9 10 to ahista ahista
