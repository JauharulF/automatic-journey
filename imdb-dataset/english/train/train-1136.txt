<START> those who love the book jane eyre as i do it's my all time favorite and i re read it at least once a year will love this version timothy dalton is just a tad too good looking to be mr rochester but other than that he does a marvelous job portraying the brooding master of thornfield zelah clarke may have been just a little too old to play the 18 year old jane but when i watch this movie i don't think about the ages of the characters the dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book which was very smart sure this film might seem a little long but it's the only version i've seen that includes part 3 of the story br br i wish the people who made this film had been involved in the newer zeferelli version as it would have helped that mess of a film br br i also realized the last time i watched this video that judy cornwell plays aunt reed she is so versatile that i didn't recognize her she plays daisy in keeping up appearances and also played mrs musgrove in 1995's persuasion another wonderful adaption br br update got the dvd this week and it's marvelous to see the original unedited version there's lots more at the beginning young jane at gateshead and at lowood and at the end they've restored lots of things i always wondered why st john had a slip of paper when he reveals that he knows who jane is because the part where he tears it from her painting was edited out of the us vhs version rosamund oliver is in it she was completely cut out of the vhs as far as i could tell they hadn't edited out any of timothy dalton's parts so nothing new there but it is great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying the vhs thanks bbc ps i would have paid more for a special edition dvd with maybe some interviews with the stars or a making of show
<START> this film is fun if your a person who likes a good campy feature film every now and then by no means is this movie fine cinema but if you dont take things too seriously and can laugh at yourself once in a while elvira is a good frownbuster
<START> when i heard this film was directed by ang lee i made sure to see it this taiwanese director burst into fame with the wedding banquet and eat drink man woman a few years ago and then moved on to sense and sensibility and the ice storm now he turns his attention to another american icon the civil war br br this story takes place in missouri a union state with southern sympathies these never officially joined the confederate army instead they formed outlaw bands called bushwhackers grew they hair long and sometimes would confiscated union uniforms which they wore over their regular clothing br br the movie depicts their moral dilemma the high drama of the times and their supposedly heroic missions of killing storekeepers and farmers who aided the union there are no stars in this movie unless you consider jewel the singer well cast as a young confederate widow as a star br br tobey macquire is cast as a young german farm boy who is derided for his heritage because the germans were supposed union sympathizers this young man is an excellent actor full of fresh faced youth whose performance encompasses his wonder and subtle realizations as he's exposed to the horror of war br br jeffrey wright is a freed slave who travels with the bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom he gives a fine and understated performance br br some of the acting however is wooden especially in the long conversations they have about morality and their costumes are too new and the southern gentleman theme of manners and hat tipping and politeness to women comes across as a bit much especially since they make it a point to murder all the men who they pull from their women's arms then burn down the stores and houses br br while i don't think that this will go down as one of lee ang's great movies i did find myself fascinated by it in spite of the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes i was interested in what was happening next and felt empathy for each of the characters who all came across as real and imperfect human beings caught up in the forces of history br br not as much action as the usual war movie but yet still recommended especially for civil war buffs br br
<START> i have never read the book a wrinkle in time to be perfectly honesty after seeing the movie do i really want to well i shouldn't be reviewing this movie i'll start off with that next i'll say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable do you know why i say that because i forgot what happens in it i told you it was forgettable to be perfectly honest no tv movie will ever be better than merlin br br how do i describe a tv movie i have never written a review for one before well i'll just say that they usually have some celebrities a wrinkle in time includes only one alfre woodard or woodward i am not sure the oscar winner br br the film has cheesy special effects a mildly interesting plot scenes that make you go wtf the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go wtf what did i expect it's a tv movie they usually aren't good as is this one a wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster to top it off you'll most likely forget about it the second it's over well maybe not the second it's over but within a few minutes br br a wrinkle in time
<START> this is a terrible terrible film br br first of all tooo long the longest movie i have ever seen br br the stories are all too damn over the top br br as a matter of fact there are too many stories that the story line is ruined br br the comedy wasn't comedy it wasn't funny at all br br the story is so repulsive and badly written that it doesnot matter if the characters live or die br br i had some expectations from this movie but my expectations were crashed completely in the first few minutes br br the only thing good about this movie is the music and obviously vidya balan she gives the best performance and stands out among all the senior actors she's just a new comer and yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast look so pathetic govinda and the blonde who playes his love interest also help saving this disastrous movie govinda perfectly fits in the role of the taxi driver and the blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent performance br br another talented actress ayesha takiya is completely wasted in this movie so is priyanka akshay does his role well but it seemed too over the top anil and juhi are also totally wasted br br the only one not wasted is salman because he has no talent what so ever to be wasted br br all in all this is a very impossible movie with mishmashed screenplay and tooo masladar that the storyline is shaped according to the stupid comedy scenes imagine how stupid this movie is br br 3 10 it is four hours long think and rethink before going to the cinemas better avoid it
<START> why on earth should you explore the mesmerizing nature documentary earth how much time do you have on earth so i can explain this to you ok i will not elongate my review exploration on earth to infinity but i must stand my ground on why this is a must see the documentary takes a nature round trip on the migration paths on three animal families a female polar bear and her cubs with the real life subplot of the father bear daring it out to hunt for food in his isolated path a mama of a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a migration tour for prey and an elephant mama with her small maybe not so small they are elephants offspring migrating in africa directors alastair forthegill mark linfield did an out of this earth job in also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species besides the magnetic shots of our three animal family protagonists the cinematographically skilled team of richard brooks burton mike holding adam ravetch and andrew shillabeer were animales in camera shooting the wondrous nature sites and animal instinctive behaviors not to mention the slo mo animal prey shots were u n b e l i e a v a b l e earth is also a lesson learner on the global warming effect on the animals the papa polar bear in the doc is the poster animal boy on that consequence so fellow earthlings it is time to take the documentary voyage to visit earth today good
<START> after seeing the 1996 remake i thought it was the funniest way to see cruella de vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin the whole movie was quite funny and on my view better than the animated one but there was actually no need for a second one first of all if cruela is returning don't cure her and make her insane again just make her break away from jail and that's a rap i thought it was not very funny it's supposed to have only one original puppy returning i'd expected that it should be lucky since he was the most appealing and besides having roger and anita back too however they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred not even one hundred and two but only three puppies and a parrot that thinks he's a dog clever gerard depardieu's part was pointless at the end cruella suffers way too much way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true she gets baked inside a giant cake that was a desperate attempt of physical humor trying to imitate the same effect from the first one that just didn't work it was too much over the top and not too funny i actually felt sorry about cruella
<START> xizao is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions and its effects on a family in china da ming quanxiu pu is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother er ming wu jiang makes him believe that his father liu xu zhu has died he founds that his father is still alive as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business the public bathroom br br the movie centers around da ming's family and how he has to learn the importance of his father's job something he always had considered an old tradition that had to die soon also the movie explores his relationship with er ming who is mentally challenged and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies but also their souls br br the two main themes of the movie the family and the problems of progress are incredibly well handled and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make both themes are very good developed and we get a glimpse of chinese society and customs br br the director yang zhang tells his tale in a simple way letting the characters characters do the job it is a very simple approach but it fits the movie perfectly and i highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good zhang has enormous potential as he can tell a story without the aid of visual flare or camera tricks br br the acting is outstanding in its naturalistic approach everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks as if they were real persons being filmed the three lead characters give remarkable performances and wu jiang as er ming surely steals the show br br even when the movie could had sticked to a patronizing old days were much better message instead it takes an attitude of equilibrium like saying that progress is good and we must move on but we must not forget where we came from and keep an equilibrium between modern life and the traditions of old br br an awesome and touching film 8 10
<START> there's not much to say about this one gammera is some kind of fire breathing turtle he is loosed by a nuclear explosion he heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk oh yeah power lines i almost forgot at one time early in the film he befriends a little boy and instead of just throwing him away or squashing him he places him down on the ground safe from then on we have to watch this chubby faced little twerp show up and run away show up and run away show up and run away for some reason gammera is able to hear this kid from 20 000 feet away oh well the plot is to try to get gammera to get to a place where he can be put on board a rocket and shot into space as usual the monster is lumbering and uncoordinated a guy in a gammera suit the japanese army with the help of americans uses up enough ammunition and fire power to solve the national debt and of course it does no good they should know this anyway we've seen a lot of monsters stomp on tokyo not to put these down because they can be fun but it's really not very good
<START> hobgoblins is a very cheap and badly done gremlins rip off that's the best thing one can say about this stinkpile pretty much everyone in the cast was chosen for their looks and not their acting ability it was very painful to watch br br avoid this one at all costs
<START> this film concerns purportedly non establishment types aesthetically and sexually who apparently cannot resist basic romantic needs although some excellent players take part including jon tenney timothy olyphant and cynthia nixon they are grounded by a puerile script which relies nearly totally upon clever dialogue which isn't nixon's role possesses the best lines but she often homes in on them too quickly a timing flaw which must be saddled upon the director the grotesque climax utilizes every available cliche spent or not and fittingly ends this drab attempt at comedy
<START> curiously it is rene russo's eyes and mouth not buddy the gorilla's that emerge as the focal point of buddy a jim henson pictures production through francis ford coppola's zoetrope somehow countless close ups of russo's face slipped passed in the post production stages and she literally fills the screen so many times the poor apes are upstaged unintentionally funny true story adapted from gertrude trudy davies lint's memoirs about a wealthy doctor's wife who turns their mansion into a menagerie for pets and wild life the movie goes beyond good intentions it positively drips with earnest sincerity the movie never sparkles with the kind of family film magic that it needed and before too long both the people and the animals seem distinctly programmed nothing here feels real about ten minutes in two chimpanzees are goofing around in russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher's knife back and forth it misses alan cumming's head by inches yet no eyebrows are raised because it's all in a day's fun still when full grown gorilla buddy gets crazy during a thunderstorm the cops are called and everyone stares at buddy through the window while he busts up the living room furniture the furniture should be the least of anyone's worries in this flabbergasting do gooder failure but at least we know russo was in good hands whenever director caroline thompson needs a good pick up shot she gives unstartled rene another extreme close up i wonder what the lipstick budget was on this picture from
<START> the intruder l'intrus is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life br br grizzled michel subor plays louis trebor like jason bourne as an old man with a hidden past living simply in an isolated hut in the woods for justifiably paranoid reasons but attracting pretty young women who can be useful to him we learn more about him through dreams flashbacks and a journey that may unfold chronologically or not as well as through his brusque interactions with family lovers business associates and a striking nemesis like the limey the film resonates with parent child regrets and a suspicious past revealed through clips from an old film with the same actor as a young man here paul gÃ©gauff's 1965 adventure film le reflux br br in a complete contrast of moods we meet his son sidney grÃ©goire colin who has to be the sexiest house husband in the world as he sweetly and seductively does household repairs and cares for a baby a toddler and every need of his working wife surely director co writer claire denis must have created him as a woman's fantasy if ever there was one and a lesson to other filmmakers on filming foreplay there's an additional extended scene where he seeks his father in the woods while carefully carrying his angelic baby in a pouch he is everything his father is not and has every relationship his father is incapable of sustaining no wonder he thinks his father is a lunatic i spent the rest of the film in dread that something bad would happen to him as the true nature of the heart of his alienated father is very gradually played out before our eyes br br the film is a puzzle but subor is ruthlessly fascinating as we watch him traverse countries and negotiate nefarious deals and the voice over narration for denis's beau travail was annoying anyway we have to figure out from skylines and incidental signage that he is traveling to geneva korea and the south pacific time passing is indicated by the seasons changing and scars being created and healing there are lots of images of water for cleansing and for distancing br br continuing her fascination with the morphing of colonialism into globalization as well as playing a bit on stereotypes of the mysterious orient and russian criminals denis has incorporated elements from robert louis stevenson paul gauguin and marlon brando's tahiti idylls and a 40 page memoir by french philosopher jean luc nancy the last for the title and heart transplant plot used for an ironic theme of limited immortality which does have consequences br br while louis thinks he's succeeded in being above boundaries rules and morals there is some amusement in the last act as the locals don't quite know what to do with him and try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey even as he again lies in isolation br br several people in the audience left in frustration at the elliptical but strikingly beautiful story telling method the unconventional narrative does raise a lot of plot questions on details
<START> the original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the tv series because most people watch for the 1930s style ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the underground can play at that game too hanging the storyline on a plot about the jarrow march was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so i suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing all the stuff about japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time this would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show it is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content
<START> firstly i must admit that it isn't a good movie and i would never watch this movie if pacino wasn't in it br br the movie is about a publicist's strange 24 hours and he is overworked dizzy sick and sometimes regretful i don't like the character at all it's really boring after 20 minutes you may fall asleep and i don't understand why pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible movie just because of money or what br br since i'm an avid pacino fan i bought this 2002 movie people i know if you haven't bought it yet don't even think about it it's just a waste of time
<START> a slasher flick made in the early 80's has a curse on it which has anyone who tries to finish it turning up dead years later a group of film students attempted to complete the movie also resurrecting the films deadly curse great idea for a film but sadly 'cut' is just another wasted opportunity br br unfortunately australia hasn't had the world's best track record when it comes to horror 'razorback' 1984 was an out and out dud as was 'holwing iii' 1987 which was half an american film anyway as for our foray into comedy horror 'body melt' 1993 is best left forgotten the problem with 'cut' is that the makers trying to create a clever horror satire a la 'scream' 1996 but have no insight into the genre or what makes it work and although this sounds weird me saying this about a slasher film but what 'cut' really lacks is any heart sure it follows the basic rules established by 'scream' but it doesn't want to play with the formula instead it goes for a cardboard copy of the earlier br br the killer scarman is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villains in horror movie history his endless barrage awkwardly lame one liners would make the dialogue of a porno seem like shakespeare the cast never seem like their fully involved and look like their just waiting for a shoot to be over so they can collect their pay checks and the feel of the film is like it's deliberately trying not to be creepy looking more like an episode of 'neighbors' or 'heartbreak high' by the way those attempts at mtv style hyper cinema during the research sequence just look lame dated and out of place br br if australia ever gets a chance to do horror again which i hope we still do maybe we should take a leaf from the 'mad max' 1979 book instead of trying to copy the u s we should be trying our own take on the genre
<START> you know you're in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at half speed instead of full throttle in a movie and the incubus is a dreadful worst case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills actually observing the hammy script and john hough's 'baroque' art direction one can hardly blame him the movie has something to do with a series of rape murders going on in a small town with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in somehow the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene and cassavetes seems visibly p o 'ed at times the incubus itself which doesn't show up until the last scene is a well done creation but it's not worth waiting for br br 1 10
<START> i would of given this film a zero out of ten but i will give it a two reason one is that shah rukh khan appears in the film which is not really a reason last point is that rani appears in this film and does a smooch with kamal i love rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress which is why i didn't enjoy her in this movie kissing kamal but its no big deal anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable lets actually talk about this film is it good or bad i think its a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn me being a fantastic critic you can see my other 250 review's by clicking on my name i have great taste the movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema why is there no morale in this movie its a biased movie thats not a true story and it stinks watching kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick man cant kiss properly anyway
<START> an excellent and accurate film mcgovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off he is not afraid to tell the truth even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy br br once again mcgovern brings in christopher eccleston though not in as high a profile a role as he played in hillsborough i found this movie as accurate well acted and well presented as hillsborough and i applaud mcgovern for his poignant unapologetic writing well done and my hat is off to the writer the actors the production crew a great film
<START> although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere and some okay shots that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs days the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere br br the film is about erroll babbage gere who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire his office thrusts upon him his replacement allison lowry claire danes stardust who quickly discovers that babbage is obsessed with his job and that job ain't very fun he monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction allison goes with erroll on many calls to check up on his flock of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement but erroll is good at his job even if his methods aren't he taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants' pasts it is this good justification that challenges the audience on some level letting us see how brutal erroll is and yet how out of touch he's become by being too close to his job br br when a teenage girl goes missing in erroll's area he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock but how could he know is erroll that good at his job allison challenges him and erroll pushes back their battles become as fierce as erroll's need to find this missing girl br br although the set up for the story was okay it didn't have any umpf i will give credit to richard gere however who plays the erroll character very well battling retirement worried about everyone who's near his flock disgusted with those he's responsible for overseeing disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does quite a change in character portrayal for gere but beyond him there's not much else some of the sets are okay dark and dangerous but there are so many other problems as to be laughable br br i'll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films but that suspension has limits the biggest push against those limits is the destruction of extremely vital crime scenes someone as meticulous as erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge no no or trampling through a crime scene or moving evidence it went beyond and hurt the film to no end br br the other damaging part of this film is that we never get into clair danes' character allison she's almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we're never privy to what her intension might be will she stay or leave will she end up like erroll if she does stay this isn't a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up
