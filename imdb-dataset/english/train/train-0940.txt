<START> this worldwide was the cheap man's version of what the nwa under jim crockett junior and jim crockett promotions made back in the 1980s on the localized big 3 stations during the saturday morning afternoon wrestling craze when ted turner got his hands on crockett's failed version of nwa he turned it into world championship wrestling and proceeded to drop all nwa references all together nwa world wide and nwa pro wrestling were relabeled with the wcw logo and moved off the road to disney mgm studios in orlando florida and eventually became nothing more than recap shows for wcw's nitro thunder and saturday night worldwide was officially the last wcw program under turner to air the weekend of the wcw buyout from vince mcmahon and wwf today the entire nwa world wide wcw worldwide video tape archive along with the entire nwa wcw video tape library in general lay in the vaults of wwe headquarters in stamford connecticut
<START> can anybody tell me where is the comedy br br charlie sheen is a very weak comedian thomas haden church is looking so feeble with him and the whole thing is so thickheaded br br they tried to make a live comic book which turned out to be super bloody comic nightmare and it wasn't even funny like the plan's scene in the bathroom it was so good with its cinematic imagination but there is nothing more except pain br br donald sutherland his relationship with his daughter br br this is actually a kind of work which they made it just to made it and earn some money from it but it became such a crime when this money would be robbed from the very us whom got deceived by so low art work and an entertainment had absolutely no entertainment at all br br well it would've been uglier if it was big production and starring brando in his golden years with a real star br br the sheen's family in here just be aware of that br br anyone who found themselves admiring this movie or god forbid loving it then you must go directly to therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt anybody else br br brando undoubtedly is a genius but the movie isn't and he wasn't intending to be one in here after reading this for sure but the main big problem is that no one else ever worked in this thing trying or wanting to be a small time smart or even good sorry i'm crying now the movie's torturing is unbelievable br br there is a scene where brando hitting mira sorvino by her shoes that was so realistic maybe he was seeing himself in her so he was punishing himself for being in such a crap br br for the milliard time this one could've been better or less worse the script till the train's heist was nice and i just imagined that they'd escape to have some chase like it's another smokey and the bandit but with brando as the sheriff in fact any of those chimeras was much merciful than what i've watched br br why this masterpiece didn't receive any razzie award you want to make me believe that there was lower movie than this i do not think so it's a situation where the razzie's supervisor must himself win one for his negligence br br martin sheen is here also as a guest star maybe for supporting his failure son but ironically the father was as failure as his son and why is that well because i hate martin sheen maybe more than i hate comic movies weren't as good as its ambition br br it's not a comedy movie no it's a horror one and i just hate horror movies especially those which have been propagandized as comic ones br br name good thing about it hmmm well this one compared to another marlon brando's monster movie the island of dr moreau 1996 would be close to casablanca br br p s if you still want to know what are or who are precisely the bad the ugly and the very ugly in this movie just pray your last prayers and go watch it may god help you
<START> as a young teenager at the time airwolf was compulsory viewing for a generation who wanted their cowboys and indians to have amazing gadgets and whizz bang explosions br br in many ways the show was essentially knight rider in the skies similar comic book technology a central character who was essentially a loner and echoing the concept of one man making a difference br br but in other important ways it was thematically very different from knight rider street hawk the a team and other action shows of the time for one thing the premise of the series is built not on a desire to help those in need but by stringfellow hawke's possession of airwolf for essentially selfish reasons as leverage to try to find his mia brother st john and then there is the dark edge provided by basing the series firmly in an 80s cold war context complete with soviet espionage and central american dictators not to mention the enemy within sure the a team constantly referred back to vietnam and the team's status as fugitives but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely central to the plot itself with airwolf the intrigue was key to the tone and direction of the show although this was ill advisedly diluted as the series went on br br with hindsight the cold war setting clearly dates the series many of the stories are creaky and contrived and much of what airwolf does is clearly implausible even with today's technology but that's really not the point airwolf was rip roaring fun it tried to tell interesting stories without relying solely on the big action sequences and it didn't sugar coat everything by miraculously ensuring nobody died sometimes it failed but often it succeeded admirably and on a tv budget to boot br br for uk readers dmax sky channel 155 have just started jan 2008 daily re runs of airwolf set your sky box for this blast from the past we may even get the re tooled re cast and sadly vastly inferior fourth season which to my knowledge has never previously been shown in the uk
<START> to this day when you speak of the japanese cinema most folks won't talk about rashomon or the seven ronin or ran to the masses the japanese cinema means all those monsters we've grown to love destroying those japanese cities over and over again lots of times in battles with each other the first and greatest of these is godzilla who's come back a dozen times or more and in a few films faced the three headed hydra like monster from outer space ghidrah br br oddly enough in keeping with the times the special effects got slightly better but part of the charm of those old films was seeing those paper mache city sets destroyed they looked so phony maybe three steps above ed wood br br some visitors from the future have time traveled to japan to urge that godzilla be destroyed from when he was first discovered and in fact he was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during world war ii when he protected the japanese garrison on a pacific island from those american troops but later on with atomic testing on bikini godzilla the friendly dinosaur just like barney became the mean machine we've grown to know in the cinema br br of course you eliminate godzilla than you give ghidrah a clear field to wreck japan so it does not become the economic colossus it was by 1991 when the film came out more i won't say but we all know japan is doing reasonably well as 2010 br br like all the other japanese monster films just sit back and enjoy the mayhem
<START> the caprica episode s01e01 is well done as a pilot really this episode is the exact same content as the dvd pilot release that having been said episode 01 gives a very substantive background of the very popular battlestar galactica series both the original and the 2007 remake it significantly applies most to the 2007 series as is the trending plots of sci fi of late this series explores virtual life or environment on top of this we are given much background on the adama family line as well as their relationship with the unrevealed in the battlestar galactica series creator of the cylons to the most part this first episode revolves around the popular topic of virtual life and as is expected early life of the colonies and the birth of the cylons br br over all i rather enjoyed this episode although it was not new material for myself or anyone that has already seen the dvd release of the caprica pilot the series seems very promising as is the case with many pilots episode 01 leaves us with a cliff hanger so to ensure a follow by an audience sci fi community i'm definitely going to keep watching for resolve as well as development br br i give this series 8 stars
<START> this movie is a pathetic attempt apparently to justify the actions of mary ann letourneau in order to do this they cast a 19 year old well probably not in order to do this there was no way they could have cast a 12 or 13 year old as the boy because the love scenes would have grossed everyone out if they had even been allowed to do them as they should mary ann's boyfriend was my nephew's age making her a pedophile sixth grade people the definition of pedophile doesn't have to include many children all you need is one br br i really don't care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage she had a responsibility to her students that she did not live up to the reason given is that she is bipolar rejected the diagnosis and refused to take her medication it's understandable then that she was not thinking rationally one hopes that she now understands her actions br br now that she and vili are married and have two children together i pray that she is on her medication and thinking clearly br br all that aside penelope ann miller was totally convincing and perfect casting for the role
<START> one can only assume that robert osborne is contractually obligated to express delight at even the least appealing films in the tcm library as this would explain him extolling the 'virtues' of this charming film during his introduction when i saw this on cable tv seeing as any old film on imdb receives 'classic' status from a number of fawning amateur reviewers i thought there was a dire need for a more honest review of this film br br this is not your father's 'shop around the corner' for all my quibbles with 'you've got mail' it still outshines this as a remake in just about every way imaginable for those who have seen the original the flaws will only be all the more obvious br br from one of the lamest meet cute sequences i can recall seeing a sad slapstick attempt at 'humor' this film gets off on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step this 'musical' only qualifies as one in the sparsest sense of the term there are a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then there's judy singing i don't care while flailing her arms around as if in a seizure the christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her better numbers here miss garland was wonderful in a number of musical films but here she seems horribly miscast the role was originally to have been filled by june allyson and judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of margaret sullavan's old part van johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate jimmy stewart type the leads never achieve the chemistry of stewart sullavan or even that of hanks ryan br br this is a film that knows some of the notes but not the music it doesn't really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for van johnson's character to complicate things unnecessarily the remake's substitution for the original's infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device involving a priceless violin it is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of three's company by someone with a delorean and a flux capacitor it's really just an excuse for a keaton pratfall even the big resolution scene between the romantic leads is mishandled after seeing both films you'll understand why they called it 'the lubitsch touch' and not the 'robert z leonard touch' br br avoid this and rewatch either the original film or one of judy garland's earlier films unless you're an iconoclast who enjoys seeing a once great star falling down to earth
<START> recap full moon a creature a huge werewolf is on the hunt not for flesh not for blood not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though but for a mate he is on the hunt for a girl not any girl though the girl the girl that is pure and also a werewolf although she doesn't know it yet three well check that two cops after the first scene and an old bag lady is all that can stop it or even knows that the thing killing and eating a lot of folks around full moon is a werewolf this particular powerful werewolf darkwolf is closing in on the girl if he gets her mankind is doomed now the cops has to find the girl convince her not only that there is someone a werewolf nonetheless that wants to rape her and perhaps kill her but that she is a werewolf herself and then they got to stop him br br comments this is one for the boys the teenage boys a lot of scenes with semi nude girls more or less important for the plot mostly less well i guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is expectedly thin and unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking one usually turns to two main themes nudity check and then special effects hmm well there are some things that you might call effects they're not very special though in fact to be blunt they are very bad the movie seems to be suffering of a lack of funds they couldn't afford clothes for some of the girls and the effects are cheap some of the transformations between werewolf and human form obviously done by computer are really bad you might overlook such things but the darkwolf in itself is very crude too and you never get to see any killings just some mutilated corpses afterwards and there is surprisingly little blood about in a movie that honestly should be drenched in blood br br i'm not sure what to say about actors and characters most of the times they do well but unfortunately there are lapses were the characters or actors just looses it a few of these lapses could be connected with the problems mentioned above like the poor effects or the poor budget that could explain why there is precious little shooting even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight and not moving but hey when you're in real danger there nothing that will save your life like a good one liner br br unfortunately that can't explain moments when the cop steve the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem the werewolf that is runs away when the only things he can be sure of is that the werewolf is coming for the girl who is just beside him now and that he cannot let it have her but sure it let the makers stretch the ending a little more br br but i wouldn't mind seeing none of the lead actors actresses get another try in another movie br br well to give a small conclusion not a movie that i recommend br br 3 10
<START> inspirational tales about triumph of the human spirit are usually big turn offs for me the most surprising thing about men of honor is how much i enjoyed it in spite of myself the movie is as predictable and cliched as it gets but it works much credit goes to the exhilarating performances by both leads it's a perfect role for cuba gooding jr who's wonderfully restrained here we have come to expect a lot from de niro and he doesn't disappoint he creates a darkly funny portrait director george tillman jr set out to make an old style flick and comes up with a winner
<START> i saw paris je t'aime because a friend really wanted to see it so i went along with him going in i was indifferent about the film but leaving the theater i really regretted wasting 2 hours of my life sitting through this tepid production the stories are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were awful what do gena rowlands and ben gazzara have to do with paris the endless parade of american actors most definitely gave this french film a remarkably non french feel the clichÃ©s about paris were endless yes most of them were playing with clichÃ©s about paris but by spending so much time making fun of french clichÃ©s they directly and regrettably promoted them once more yes paris is the city of love we get it br br the worst segments were the one directed by wes craven oscar wilde the one with nick nolte the mime one the worst the hair products one the one with juliette binoche willem dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of paris the vampire one when i think of paris i think of elijah wood the one with natalie portman which really looked like a mentos commercial and it was stupid the blind young man should know portman was just playing a part when she called him on and on it went it felt endless br br i didn't like the coen bros one as well it really plays with those parisien clichÃ©s but i didn't find it funny just annoying the gus van sant one was interesting but it was so slight and the punchline was obvious that it barely registered br br there were only two successful segments and they were the one about the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby at a kindergarten only to babysit a baby for a rich woman nice irony there and the segment about the african who is stabbed it's the best segment in the whole film but this segment has nothing to do with paris the story could have taken place in any city around the world br br the last segment the one with the chubby middle aged woman was sorta interesting too but the underlying tone was bad they wanted to celebrate her limited grasp of french but the segment came off as being condescending br br the whole project felt forced and uninspired almost like the french government sponsored this film to promote tourism all in all with only about 10 to 15 minutes of interesting stuff paris je t'aime was an awful cinematic experience
<START> any film with a title as ridiculous as the bagman should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie lover but the plot is far different than what one may expect after viewing the dvd cover the bagman is by no means a good movie it falls into the category of films that seem to have been and probably were filmed on a home video camera the acting is awful i haven't heard and seen such wooden acting since troll 2 there are plenty of scenes with nudity and sex but they are clearly jumped into too fast the characters are morons and entirely forgettable the ending which i will not spoil can be easily anticipated after watching the very first scene due to the cheesy nature of the film nothing aside from the awful production values is truly scary awful attempts at realistic gore a driving scene where the car is clearly stationary etc recommended for bad movie aficionados only
<START> i have a piece of advice for the people who made this movie too if you're gonna make a movie like this be sure you got the f x to back it up also don't get a bunch of z list actors to play in it another thing just about all of us have seen jurassic park so don't blatantly copy it all in all this movie sucked f x sucked acting sucked story unoriginal let's talk about the acting for just a second the carradine guy who's career peaked in 1984 when he did revenge of the nerds which was actually a great comedy he's not exactly z list he can act he just should have said no to this s t bag he should have did what mark hamill did after return of the jedi and go quietly into the night he made his mark as a nerd and that should have been that i understand he has bills to pay but that hardly excuses this s t bag have i called this movie that yet o k i just wanted to be sure if i sound a little hostile i apologize i just wasted 2hrs of my life i could have spent doing something productive like watching paint peel and i feel cheated i'll close on that note thank you for your time
<START> this is a well worn story about a man who marries to escape the hangman's noose then sets about taming his reluctant bride it manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time we never find out for example why a woman who won the respect of an indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband or why the members of her team are so eager to get a real man in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own this only made sense in fifties hollywood br br there's a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whip the second time then yanks her off her horse never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip then he prevails in a fight against her indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp that's some second wind later he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty indians as they all are in these flicks after they reject her now she's his squaw never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and she's been negotiating with them for years and the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on him yeah right like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail br br finally neither of the leads is convincing in their roles madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy the only reason you'd root for her is because you want to see madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the film's end the way that madison tames fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blow up dolls even if you do see them as dolls the total lack of suspense will bore you br br total waste of time even the scenery's kinda dull give this one a big miss
<START> manmohan desai made some entertaining though illogical films like aaa parvarish and naseeb but he made some craps like coolie and mard and then gjs br br this movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the dial became famous mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so bad you cringe br br the british are made carricatures and the film looks so weird the scene in the british hotel is damn stupid br br the film has many stupidities like amrita assaulting amitabh and then the entire scene plus towards the climax the film becomes even worse there are more gems like the horse statue getting life the masks of amitabh haha and more br br direction by manmohan desai is bad music is okay br br amitabh does his part with style nothing different from coolie laawaris type roles amrita singh is okay satyen kapuu is okay prem chopra is as usual nirupa roy is again her usual self dara singh is also as usual
<START> the opening scenes move as fluidly as frozen velveeta the attempt at dramatic dialogue only makes me wish i had better control of the fast forward control vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or mangy disgusting creatures this vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy i usually tally a body count so there was a cat which doesn't count a bum a girl who fell out of the sky with a sword in her whatever that was about and then the plot foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm but using the sound of biting into an apple for a vampire biting a victim is just plain silly i liked warlock but this movie just stunk so bad that we turned it off and it was so forgettable we rented it a year later only to turn it off again
<START> bernard rapp passed away last year and was a very cultured journalist cinema was one of his biggest passions he penned a vast worldwide dictionary of films and so he was bound to wield a camera at least one time in his life but the films he left garnered lukewarm reviews tirÃ© Ã  part 1996 in spite of terence stamp's sensational performance was very caricatured in the depiction of the characters une affaire de goÃ»t 2000 was a slick affair even if bernard giraudeau delivered a perverse performance pas si grave 2003 was another let down and un petit jeu sans consÃ©quence is as underwhelming as its predecessors its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy way br br and however the starting idea let predict a twirling spiritual comedy a couple held by yvan attal and sandrine kiberlain who invited their friends is in full moving in a lascivious mansion to play with their guests they pretend to part company with each other and things don't go as planned because the announcement of their separation doesn't surprise them the two lovers start to ponder about the validity of their couple br br in spite of lush scenery and the promising material he had at his disposal rapp's undistinguished directing can't manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences the plot follows a well worn pattern with characters who have specific well known functions and masks that are unveiled about who they really are verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat a bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from rapp to abruptly cut many sequences even the actors' sincere input in the venture is debatable they seem to be bored and to recite their texts than to live them especially sandrine kiberlain the audience is soon caught in a deep torpor br br it's regrettable to say it bernard rapp's films never lived up to his intentions as un petit jeu sans consÃ©quence bears witness
<START> i never really watched this program before although it came highly recommended by members of my family funnily enough my girlfriend lives in hadfield the filming location and she pointed out a few landmarks when i first visited br br this got my interest going so i bought the 1st series on video and sat down to watch besides recognising some of the locations i found myself not in the least bit surprised once again the bbc were responsible for producing another example of the finest comedy in the world tlog easily ranks up there with red dwarf fawlty towers and monty python as probably the best br br suffice to say i am hooked on the program now the characters are superb and show unusual depth while retaining a scarily realistic edge the look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes bleak feeling of the north no disrespect to hadfield which i have found a very welcoming and warm place br br i only hope that it continues its originality throughout its run which based upon the 2nd series which concluded its rerun in the uk last night it certainly is br br well done the bbc
<START> when the young kevin gets the boat of his dead uncle as a gift he invites five friends of him to a trip to catalina island for the weekend while in the journey they drink booze have sex and play games with each one of them telling his or her greatest fear later kevin drowns in the open sea the engine stops and they are haunted and murdered by their greatest innermost fear br br yesterday my wife son daughter and three other friends joined to watch haunted boat on dvd with less than 30 minutes running time the group gave up watching this messy and boring amateurish piece of crap and we decided to see another film later i decided to watch the rest of this flick to see how bad it could be and it would have been better off going to bed to sleep the confused story has an awful cinematography and camera work with a cast that is probably studying to be actors and actresses and in the end this film seems to be a bad project of cinema school the terrible and pretentious screenplay shows a ridiculous twist in the end actually a complete mess that made me not understand what the story is all about was the girl insane and traveled alone in the boat imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends if that is true are their friend again in the very end fruit of her madness my vote is one br br title brazil viagem para a morte trip to the death
<START> bell book and candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid twentieth century very similar to the phenoms we see today back in the 70's more than ten years later there were still endless references to this film it made novak a huge star put a nice item on jack lemon's resume cast new light on jimmy stewart and gave lancaster and gingold new avenues to explore in their careers both went on to continue to play witches and other curious old bats in film and television br br along with the 40s movie i married a witch which helped to make veronica lake an icon bell book and candle inspired the grand film and tv fascination with all things witchy that began with bewitched and has continued through practical magic worst witch and harry potter br br what i rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather interesting alternative xmas movie the story takes place over the christmas holidays and despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft actually embodies a great deal of xmas spirit giving love family self sacrifice etc br br i will always watch this movie have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90's particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season it has style substance a great cast and terrific production values and like adam's rib it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time are radical even now in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful and so always seems ahead of the times
<START> comments contain spoilers i was barely holding on to this show as appointment tv when they started the annoying music under every scene when don epps was averaging almost a shooting per case when the very nasally diane farr was obviously pregnant but we weren't to notice and when colby was a f g triple agent but now in tonight's episode david is trapped with a paranoid nut job who is an obvious amateur with a gun in an elevator and he can't disarm him a trained experienced field agent who has been 1st through the door many times and is experienced in hand to hand fighting can't take out a nut job not when said nut job blinks looks away drops his head closes his eyes not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds br br then the scene came that let me know that as much as i enjoy learning from the chubby frumpish but very charming charles epps and his sexy sidekick love interest amita my friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged don gives david the distress word that is the code for the s t is about to go down david is ready they kill the lights drop the elevator startle the nut job and br br david cannot disarm kill beat into submission the nut job the bad guy ends up with both guns david ends up shot br br i'm done hope the numb3rs are fun
