<START> the running man is one of those films that if overwatched would become boring and depressing even br br my advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks br br in todays climate of tv media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really does work as a revisionist social commentary post 1980s boom forget that though there are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this film br br schwarzenegger is on top form as ben the butcher of bakersfield richards and the inclusion of bond belting one liners was completely inspired thety are truly leg end dary with his rant to killian over a camera the main highlight br br the design of the stalkers is authentically american and mirrors the characterizations seen in the pc 'gladiators' tv show and the wwe as well buzz saw's grisly end will chill any viewer to the core as a foot note why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an upbeat actioner with a bitter sense of humour br br jesse venturer and sven ole thorssen are great as backing muscle and are arnies buds in real life and its even got mick fleetwood in it too what more could you ask for br br i highly recommend the running man if you're looking for a great piece of entertaining action with a glossty finish and some great characters just don't expect an education from it at least on surface value br br quality i bloody love it actually you will too unless you're a thesp 7 10
<START> the fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script is beyond me this really must be one of the worst films in addition to haunted highway i have ever seen bad actors and a really bad story there's no normal reactions to any event in this film and even though it's halloween normal people would have bigger reactions when they're witnessing their father being killed not to mention gutted people with tape covering their airways not being able to breathe in a room with at least 50 people i might add and some person dressed up as satan dragging dead people out of his house even an 8 year old would see the difference between a doll and a person not to mention the fact that no one could possibly be that naive and dumb to believe the reality of satan and jesus' appearances on the same day like this kid does when i was 8 i sure had more brains than that br br but the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be falling for this mute satan look alike as well no questions asked the question throughout the film is is it really satan or is it some crazy person killing people off whenever he feels like it well he's got human hands arms built and whatever so i guess he's supposed to be in the movie as well otherwise they did a lousy job concealing it then with this person being human and all he was able to kill an old lady a man and his mistress 5 cops all with guns and training i presume and a few other people and obviously everyone was just standing there waiting for him or what br br the whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing i've seen and i would never recommend anyone to waste 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to watch this total crap
<START> welcome back kiefer sutherland it's been too long since you've appeared in a movie and what a movie this was was it 24 no but very intriguing especially with a pro like michael douglas in the lead as the embattled secret service agent kiefer's character is the one chasing michael douglas the whole movie kiefer's partner is eva longoria the desperate houswife wow she can actually act besides flirt all day and look good i wish though that kim bassinger had a bigger role but other than that i really think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish this movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller everybody played their part to the hilt nothing was revealed to sooon in the movie so as to keep you guessing at all times and i really think that kiefer did one heck of a job here in this movie but in my opinion michael douglas had the besxt performance of the day thumbs up
<START> we went to the movie with a group because the play we were going to was cancelled it is without doubt one of the worst movies ever it is not that i don't like cult movies i do but nothing happens in the film one does not feel any connection with the characters whatsoever endless times without dialog and the car how do thay carry a huge tent and beds chairs and clothing for every day in that car it is a two seater i have to say however the scenery is beautiful but not in a movie the director should have made a photoshoot of the movie so that we could skip about 80 minutes of useless time in with nothing happens anyway br br i would not recommend it as it is a waste of your time
<START> this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing it is shot on video not film i have not seen the likes of this since the early 70's when late night networks showed movie of the week 'horror flicks' shot in video it looks like a bad soap opera and that is paying it a compliment some of the actors give it their best shot michael des barres does okay with what he is given to do which is to act like a sex addict out of control i can't say that it is pleasant to watch br br nastassja kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film with very little variation in camera angles i can't fault her for someone else's poor blocking but she is totally unbelievable in her role her little girl voice works against her here and i consider myself a nastassja kinski fan she is certainly ageless and exotic but she's outside her range with this br br alexandra paul is pathetically overwrought every line she delivers is with three exclamation points someone must have directed her to scream at all costs why would michael des barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew br br finally rosanna arquette as the sweet maligned wife comes off okay and probably the most believable of the bunch but that is not saying much br br this has to be the worst film i have seen in years
<START> i purchased this video quite cheaply ex rental thinking that the cover looked quite nice and it was nice but the movie is trash i can handle b grade i sometimes even enjoy a good b romp ie 'surf nazis must die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be but this was just bland bland bland incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences this movie has very little to offer
<START> the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and i've seen it many times since it always manages to entertain me while being effectively creepy as well the flashback scenes are what really made it for me cristina raines's father running around all creepily with the two creepy woman always manages to send chills down my spine it's your typical good vs evil thing but at least it manages to be entertaining the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history it has plenty of shocks and suspense seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen had me on the edge of my seat the sentinel has the perfect build up of tension we are never fully comfortable whenever allison is on screen we know something terrible is always awaiting her and that made things all the more tense this movie is often neglected among horror fans but i personally think it's one of the better one's out there and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfied br br performances cristina raines has her wooden moments but came though in a big way for the most part she's beautiful to look at and her chemistry with saranadon felt natural chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend michael he had an instant screen presence and i couldn't help but love him martin balsam josÃ© ferrer john carradine ava gardner arthur kennedy sylvia miles deborah raffin jerry orbach richard dreyfuss jeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos burgess meredith is terrific as chazen he looks like a normal old man but what we find out is absolutely terrifying eli wallach christopher wlaken do well as the bumbling detectives beverly d'angelo has one chilling scene that i won't spoil br br bottom line the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied well worth the look br br 7 10
<START> it's a rehash of many recent films only this one has fewer stars lesser complications and a more fuzzy feel to it abhay and ritika played by fardeen khan esha deol respectively meet at a friend's wedding where their own marriage unbeknowst to them begins its process of being arranged within no time the two strangers are married and sent of to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples going through the motions similar to theirs as they spend time together secrets are revealed hearts broken and or mended and love blossoms br br if you've seen honeymoon private limited and or salaam e ishq then you've seen this film the plot twists are the same there is not a single element of surprise in the entire two and a half hours of the film everything is predictable i only enjoyed it because i had seen 'darling' also starring the leads deol khan earlier in the day and enjoyed their chemistry in that so i said why not when my sister suggested we rent 'just married' as well br br see it because kirron kher co stars and is her usual darling self in it br br skip it because you've had enough of all this couple fest nonsense br br c
<START> a movie you start watching as a late night cable porn it is hot in that department but it has even a lot more it has a sense of humor some action in and out of the bed and it has reasonable acting as well as a story worth watching a definite adult only movie but well worth watching
<START> the reviews i read for this movie were pretty decent so i decided to check it out bad idea this is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group friends the story is stupid mix two parts ringu with one part prom night a sprinkle of i know what you did last summer and add a tiny dash of single white female now blend until completely nonsensical there is nothing new to this plot and revisiting the clichÃ©s i've grown so fond of wasn't even entertaining this time this movie jumps to and from the past too much and once i made sense of it all i realized it still didn't make much sense characters go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye speaking of characters they are all your stereotypical favorites the greedy selfish lawyer the egocentric actress the has been baseball star the video voyeur the bitter girl the spooky quiet chick the 'nicer than nice' nice girl a freakin' black cat and i didn't care about any of them perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work there were some decent scenes in it but overall this movie was a mess i should also mention a certain 'video tape' that would have been impossible to shoot br br this movie isn't the worst asian horror has to offer by far but it is still pretty bad if you just want to see some creepy images in the dark or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top acting or just want to yell you're stupid at a movie screen or just want to have another asian horror flick up your sleeve when someone asks you how many you've seen this movie is for you br br those seeking a decent plot look elsewhere
<START> 1st watched 5 27 2009 4 out of 10 dir harold young the 3rd universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result from the viewer's perspective the story is similar and the results are ho hum this time the story's location is the u s as the egyptian priest's new follower sends a mummy to our country in hopes he can revive him to kill descendants of those who opened the original tomb this time the mummy is played by lon chaney which doesn't make much of a difference because he's really not asked to do much acting for this character the new priest becomes a morgue keeper in the town and sends the mummy out to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the tanna leaf juice again a girl gets in the way as the priest falls for one of the descendent's fiancÃ© and wants her yes to be immortal with him haven't we heard this before the plan is of course thwarted as the townsfolk hunt down the mummy with torches similar to the frankenstein monster and the burning of the creature ends the story how do they get a sequel i guess you'll find out with the next one in the series or not
<START> despite its stereotypes virtually 'no name' cast and an obviously low budget i thought this film was alright much better than i expected it to be i was skeptical at first the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me but in the end i thought the film handled the concept well even if some scenes were a little clichÃ©d br br the cast was quite good and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously i couldn't help thinking though that janine turner is a bit of a geena davis look a like maybe it's just her face or the make up hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time br br while it's not a 'must see' or a great film by any standard 'fatal error' is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end
<START> skippy from family ties goes from clean cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie the film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave using skippy to help out and while the plot is corny and cliche the corniness for example an evil green fog taking off a girl's clothes and the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious and great and of course there's nothing like ozzy osbourne playing a preacher who's asking what happened to the love song definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh and while you're at it make it a double feature with slumber party massacre 2 there's an evil rocker as stated on the video box driller killer in black leather w fringe a must see for cheesy movie fans
<START> creative use of modern and mystical elements 1956 cadillac convertible to transport evil stepmother kathleen turner john waters' serial mom and the 2 twisted sisters queen mab as the faerie godmother david warner evil in time bandits in redcoat at court cinderella she's a babe shovelling coal into an insatiable furnace cinderella and her prince charming both look like and act like rock stars isle of man locations
<START> kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film mainly through cinematography but also using an ingenious score he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is in my eyes of course it doesn't hurt that jack nicholson gives one of the greatest performances i've ever seen a frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad duvall and lloyd are artificial to be nice but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time scatman crothers
<START> carrie fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem and she doesn't remember very much of it that would explain why she made this film but it doesn't explain why anyone else in the cast or crew did i can't believe that everybody had a coke problem this has to be one of the absolute worst movies ever made and that's saying something the blame can't be laid at the feet of director tim kincaid or writer buddy giovinazzo as it is obvious that this picture wasn't written or directed by anyone apparently it just spontaneously came together as there is little evidence of coherency consistency design plot sense intelligence or anything else what is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop co star robert joy has done good work in other films and composer jimmie haskell and cinematographer arthur marks are both industry veterans marks also having been a director and not a bad one why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension tim kincaid the alleged director has made quite a few low rent sci fi and horror films and having seen most of them i can tell you that not a one of them is any good this one though is by far the worst thing he's ever done and that is a major accomplishment on his part everything absolutely everything about this movie is 12th rate at best the cinematography is terrible the acting is laughable the special effects make plan 9 from outer space look like spider man the story is trite derivative and stupid don't waste your time even looking at the video box cover let alone renting it a complete utter annoying total dud
<START> i had the misfortune of wasting 10 quid buying ss new movie on dvd attack force now i usually can suspend my belief watching films like this a pinch of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the sofa watching a noisy late evening shoot em up is perfect for a single alpha male like me i bought this film thinking i'd see cool martial arts and shoot em up br br did i hell segal is old and bloated the plot was ludicrous even by ss standards and to cap it all off segal's acting such as it was to start with is exceptionally dire so dire in fact that half of his voice was dubbed over by a man who sounded nothing like him either ss cant act no more a moot point of the crew were so dreadful at their jobs they couldn't record the sound properly the voice would flick back and forth between mr whisper segal and the man who does voice overs for honda adverts br br plot wise isn't the issue because most action films work along the same premise as this one nothing new there the usual mix of characters who will die horribly as cannon fodder and stereotyped bad guys waiting to get blown away br br avoid this film like you would avoid walking in front of a speeding train or a dose of h5n1 avian flu br br utter garbage br br 1 10 br br this has been a public health warning
<START> the part where meg visits the mechanic and he says is the piston firing short implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancÃ©e was hilarious i love meg ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie very lovable and very intelligent too her innocent indignant expressions have you wishing she was yours the hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well einstein had a romantic side to his psyche the puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well it's awfully underrated and deserves accolades and attempts at a revival it loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the us govt i don't see why it doesn't figure in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century great movie it has the presidential seal of approval on it
<START> well let me go say this because i love history and i know that movie is most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed movie and julia stiles became my 1 favorite actress after seeing her in the '60s and i own this movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you to look for her new movies in the future and try to enjoy history
<START> i sat through this movie expecting a thought provoking fact based film but instead was given some of the least thought out arguments against the christian faith imaginable for instance in an effort to prove that christianity is inherently violent the narrator constantly quotes the bible without giving context and thus altering the meaning of the text jesus is quoted as commanding the execution of those who disobey him when in fact the quote is from a parable jesus told involving a king who is then quoted thus the narrator makes it appear as if jesus says one thing when he is actually telling a story where one of his characters says it this is dishonesty in a very obvious form is this really what atheism has to offer the world this film also attempts to use the success of the passion of the christ over jesus christ superstar and the last temptation of the christ as evidence that christians are bloodthirsty he makes no mention of the fact that the passion was the most historically accurate bible film to date he makes no mention of the fact that it was actually the best liked by critics of the bunch he then edits in a series of violent images from the passion as if to hammer home his point ironically he makes no mention of the texas chainsaw massacre which came out a few months later and plays violence for entertainment versus dramatic effect br br one thing that really bothered me was his mockery of people who actually knew more about the subject matter than he did all the christians he interviewed were average schmoes in the parking lot of billy graham's new york crusade atheists he interviewed for the film were notable authors and scholars he asked the christians how the christian movement started and of course they said it started with the holy spirit coming to the disciples at pentecost which is correct acts 2 he then gives the commentary isn't it funny how so few christians seem to know the origins of their own faith and proceeds to explain that the apostle paul started christianity after being stopped on the road to damascus the poor chap seems convinced that acts 9 happens before acts 2 more deception or is this simply ignorance he also throws around nonsense that paul didn't believe jesus was a real person are you kidding me 1 corinthians 15 describes jesus death and resurrection being witnessed by people whom paul names in the passage for the corinthians to question if they are in doubt br br there are many many other examples of how full of crap this 'documentary' is but because i don't have time or patience to go into them all i'll skip straight to the end it's obvious throughout the whole movie that the narrator has an emotional vendetta against his upbringing in the church and the climax interview is his childhood principle in a last ditch attempt to disprove the christian faith the narrator tries to make a fool out of someone who gave him a detention as a child is this what passes as an intellectual documentary for the atheist community surely there are intelligent atheist filmmakers out there who can make a documentary that isn't a load of made up crap passed off as 'facts'
