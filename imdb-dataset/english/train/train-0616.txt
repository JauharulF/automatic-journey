<START> this definitely is not the intellectual film with profound mission so i really don't think there is too much not to understand to in case you aren't czech br br it's just a comedy the humor is simple pretty funny and sometimes maybe little morbid some actors and characters are very similar to samotÃ¡ri 2000 jirÃ­ machÃ¡cek ivan trojan vladimÃ­r dlouhÃ½ so the authors are but it doesn't matter the genre is really different and these two films shouldn't be compared in this way jedna ruka netleskÃ¡ won't try to give you a lesson it will try to make you laugh and there is some chance it will succeed br br not bad film not the ingenious one but i enjoyed it some scenes are truly worth seeing
<START> while not as famous as some of their other collaborations such as the black cat and the body snatcher this is a dandy little horror film even though the casting decisions were a bit odd boris karloff plays dr janos rukh a weird scientist who lives in the carpathian mountains near where the dracula character's home town bela lugosi plays dr benet whose nationality was never discussed though the name certainly sounds french i really think it would have made sense to have the two switch roles as the carpathian role seems tailor made for lugosi especially with his accent however despite this unusual twist the two still did excellent jobs karloff's was definitely the lead role but lugosi acquitted himself well as a relatively normal person something he didn't play very often in films it seems that dr rukh is a bit of a pariah as other scientists especially benet think his theories are bizarre and nonsensical however over the course of the film rukh turns out to be right and benet is especially generous in his new praise for rukh but unfortunately the wonderful new element that rukh discovered has the nasty side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine don't you hate it when that happens while this could have just been a simple nice scientist turned mad story the plot was well constructed the characters nicely developed and the mad rukh was not a one dimensional killer but complex and interesting br br this film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films you can really tell that universal pictures pulled out all the stops and made a bigger budget film instead of the cheap quickies both lugosi and karloff unfortunately gravitated in later years good stuff
<START> dominick nicky luciano wears a 'hulk' t shirt and trudges off everyday to perform his duties as a garbage man he uses his physical power in picking up other's trash and hauling it to the town dump he reads comic book hero stories and loves wrestlers and wrestling going to wrestlemania with his twin brother eugene on their birthday is a yearly tradition he talks kindly with the many people he comes in contact with during his day he reads comic books which he finds in the trash with a young boy who he often passes by while on the garbage route unfortunately dominick has a diminished ability to use his mind he has a disability br br dominick's disability came as a result of an injury to the head in which he suffered traumatic brain injury tbi this injury left him slower though it did not change his core characteristic as a strong individual who helps to protect others dominick is actually more able to live independently than he may seem at the beginning of the film he lives with eugene who is studying to become a doctor dominick provides the main source of income while eugene is off studying eugene must face the fact that he is to continue his education in a different city and that he must move away from dominick eugene also develops a romance which begins to separate him from his twin brother br br the film deals specifically with domestic abuse and how this can impact individuals families and then society as a whole the strain that escalates between eugene and dominick as eugene realizes that he must eventually leave nicky exploded on their birthday night eugene yells at dominick and throws him against the wall in this moment eugene must confront his own fears of being like his abusive father the father which dominick protected him against while he himself became the victim of the abuse this event cemented the love between the two brothers who from then on became the best of friends though they needed each other they also both needed independence and the ability to grow and develop relationship with others the fact that they must part ways became a very real emotional strain however by the end of the film dominick is able to say good bye to his brother and wish him luck eugene is able to leave his brother with the confidence that he has started to make a social network of people who care about him and will help him with his independence br br when dominick witnesses the abuse of his friend he is forced to come face to face with the cause of his own trauma in this state of extreme stress dominick almost completely shuts down he then runs after the ambulance to the hospital to see what happened to his friend after learning that the boy has died he is confronted by the abusive father who fearing his testimonial tells him he didn't see nothing doesn't know anything and not to say anything and that if he does he will kill him now that his own life has been threatened he goes and find the hand gun that larry used to kill the rats he goes to the wake of the deceased boy and at gunpoint kidnaps the baby of the grieving family he runs away from the scene and hides in a building when the police surround him eugene goes in the building to talk to his brother eugene then reveals the cause of dominick's disability and they bring the baby back the abusive father then wields a gun of his own threatening to kill dominick but eugene stops him and dominick tells the crowd that he saw the father throw his son down the stairs br br through the climactic ending the issue of dysfunctional behavior comes into view though dominick's instinct to save the baby can be understood we also see how damaging this response is dominick put the baby's life and his own life in grave danger the larger societal consequences of these events is not directly implicated but rather shown through the films ending despite the more optimistic ending portrayal another sequence of events might just have likely occurred in which dominick is charged with kidnapping and possession of a firearm it is somewhat difficult to believe that this went completely unaccounted furthermore even if dominick is not charged there may still be a stigma against him within the community not that there wasn't one before these events instead the film shows that we must be able to recognize problematic behavior and act to curb it br br dominick and eugene was released in 1988 the same year as another film rainman which won 5 academy awards while rainman was an achievement and helped increase the visibility with person with disabilities it could be argued that dominick and eugene holds more valuable lessons for society whereas rainman demonstrated that mainstream american society might be able to learn from and care for a 'savant' if the 'savant' is the inheritor of a large estate dominick and eugene show that a person with a disability might be able to care for and help save members of american society the message of an independent person with disabilities may have been too strong for 1988 hopefully someday society will see the strengths of individuals with disabilities not as a threat but as imperative for the strength of society
<START> i understand that paramount wanted to film this with the rodgers and hart score but couldn't work out the copyright problems so burke and van heusen who wrote the between them the most songs for bing crosby contributed a very nice score br br i read leonard maltin saying that this movie fit crosby like a glove and i couldn't have put it better no it's not mark twain's satire it's a bing crosby film and in 1949 crosby was the most bankable star in hollywood for once paramount used technicolor and rhonda fleming was never lovelier on the screen this was a woman that technicolor was invented for br br william bendix's brooklyn origins kinda stand out but it's to a good comic effect the trio of crosby bendix and sir cedric hardwicke have a rollicking good time with busy doing nothing bing has one of his patented upbeat philosophical numbers with if you stub your toe on the moon br br the third song he sings once and for always by himself and with rhonda fleming that song was nominated for best song but lost to baby it's cold outside br br nice also that bing managed to record the score for decca with rhonda fleming and bendix and hardwicke br br one thing i like about this film is that it shows crosby's comic talents without bob hope i like the road pictures but bing was a comic talent onto himself and this film better demonstrates than any other br br this is crosby at the top of his game
<START> jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines br br but then in the third episode he says that when the europeans in south africa got too far north they ran into zulu people and other tribes that herded cattle and planted crops so what explains their lack of technological economic and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for success br br diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox brought to north america by black slaves were our biggest weapon well if 150 europeans can defeat 20 000 native warriors and 400 non military south africans can defeat 10 000 zulus without a single casualty in either case then i think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant with or without germs we were going to succeed br br he says malaria stopped europeans from colonizing further north killing thousands of europeans while not affecting africans i'd like to know real numbers but he doesn't say then at the end he says today malaria is killing thousands of africans and that is why they can't catch up with us so which is it jared did malaria help the africans by halting eurpeans or hurt them and how come europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history br br he also seems far too eager to say that the reasons europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck at times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories he's reluctant to admit that maybe europeans were successful because they worked for it it's sad watch this obvious neo marxist contort reality to try to prove his point
<START> the acting was horrible and they got both of the sports wrongggg not only did they get the figure skating rules wrong but also they rules of girls ice hockey in girls ice hockey you cannot check you also don't block for someone not all they girls are disgusting gross mean and big i play hockey and i'm only 4'11 and have been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie also not all hockey players hate figure skaters a lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves also we skate a lot faster then the ones in the movie i was embarrassed by the movie it gave people the idea that we suck although i must mention that it is difficult to transition between the sports because of the toe pick on the figure skates also some of those twirly moves katelin was doing on the ice you couldn't do in a regular hockey game she basically tripped the person which is illigal its also unrealistic that she would get a hockey scholarship when she figure skates that really made me angry that scholarship would normally be used to someone who could benefit the team
<START> overall i thought it a very nice movie i hate to use the word 'nice' as it's rather dry but it was very beautiful to look at and the central performances by rupert friend and emily blunt were very strong what i liked most was that despite the gleaming aesthetics of the costumes and the settings all gilded and shiny this aspect never took over the heart of the film which was good strong writing thank you julian fellowes d nothing too flamboyant or saturated with pomp i e not sensationalised greatly when victoria is dragged out of bed to be informed she is now queen well you couldn't get a less glamorous hand over of the crown it was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth br br undoubtedly the portrayal of the love between victoria and albert though somewhat fairytale ish on the face it was in fact a slow burning candle and friend and blunt did well to show how effortlessly these two people 'fitted' together despite the union being initially arranged my fave bit was when they come home after hunting and victoria simply hugs her new husband from behind so much said without any words that's what film is all about blunt held her own beautifully as well she has a face that demands your attention and i can't not mention the costumes that she wears every one simply gorgeous if i was blunt i would have trouble parting with any of them the rest of the ensemble cast all played their roles well harriet walter as queen adelaide being a highlight br br the only qualm i have is that it lacked a sense of urgency or an event that could have made the movie a little more exciting it was rather tame i don't know i wanted 'something' to happen that would have victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth a little more when she and albert argued i loved it i could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments though that may be just me br br lastly at the risk of sounding all patriotic it did renew a sort of pride and awe in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position especially in one so young this may be in part to the fact that this film's snap shot of victoria's young life is immediately apt to what i have been writing for one character of mine in 'the sword the scion' but nevertheless it did flag up those feelings for those following my book can you guess what character victoria so aptly reflects it might have been in part to the film displaying how ridiculous the government were back in those times as they didn't seem to give two hoots about the poor and dispossessed of the nation which only in turns renews appreciation that queen victoria and prince albert were so active in this domestic domain it made the government appear rather useless nothing much has changed then i suppose br br blog on films and books http sempergratis blogspot com
<START> i never finished this movie for a reason it was dreadful and thats just the acting i wasn't even sure what the film was about tbh it didn't make a lot of sense and the violence was awful i mean ususally i like some nude in a film lol but it was just sick because of what was happening all the characters annoyed me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera was shaking at parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with project but without any good qualities this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time and would like my time back please i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone or even consider it n
<START> except people apparently buy into this garbage as shows like moral orel have shown even if you tried to make the most outrageous over the top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of it wouldn't come close to the hilarity of this show it's hard to tell what's even going on when you're watching it is it a news show a talk show who knows they start out by reporting on various international news stories but at seemingly random points the news is interrupted by this odd troll like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy br br pat robertson doesn't even seem like such a bad guy at first glance he just seems like a senile yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs like most of our grandparents but this is a man who has called for an assassination who has befriended and offered aid to not one but two murderous dictators who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines who has supported forced abortions in china and who regularly implies that caucasians straight american male caucasians in particular are superior to all other races br br still this would all be funny except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later either that or enough money to bribe some tv executives who don't give a damn what they show the idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people somewhere must be watching it and hanging onto every word even when robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is people still listen to him i don't know if it's funny or scary i guess a healthy mixture of both
<START> that is the best way i can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husband's first wife who died under mysterious circumstances that sounds well and good but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom in fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin well trust me no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls peacocks weird gardeners and doors being knocked on and the music is the worst it consists of constant tuba music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth grader and you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate yes in the end this is a slow paced which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour boring little tale that is easily figured out by the average person apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person
<START> sadly not available on dvd as yet but worth pursuing on tcm or vhs a secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder and courageously takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth a movie with many twists and dark alleyways none of which i will mention the jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer is one of the most erotic scenes in hollywood history despite being at very low budget and made during wwii in black and white despite the low budget long island looks somewhat mountainous this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision ella raines was a great actress discovered by howard hawks who knew much about these matters casting the feistiest women joanne dru hepburn angie dickinson lauren bacall ann sheridan of their era robert siodmak was of one of several german hungarian czech film makers sirk wilder zinnemann lubitsch curtiz lang etc who Ã©migrÃ©s relocated to hollywood and brought a highly original fresh vision with them sadly ella raines was never given such a great part again and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns
<START> this has to be one of the best movies to come out of hk in a long time i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with sam lee's impossibly believable insane behavior and edison's portrayal of a killer machine which totally reversed his normal idol image i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie however i must warn you this is also an equally depressing movie as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own and struggling to breathe makes you think about what is life about really
<START> if you're a a fan of either or both chuck norris judson mills then this is the movie to see it has a lot of adventure in it it is a great follow up to president's man the chemistry between the main three stars chuck norris judson mills jennifer tung is incredible my personal opinion this movie along with the original has turned out so well that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series if you've seen president's man i recommend this movie for you if you've seen president's man a line in the sand but you haven't seen president's man then let me suggest that you do you will not be disappointed with either one
<START> this is one of the most guilty pleasure movies ever br br i am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is tish but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit like super cool with a like totally bitchin belt and stick on rhinestones on her face br br but anyways the movie is actually one of the few family movies that holds your interest i know that the begining drags particuarly if you know what is going to happen but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family film br br i wouldn't stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself but i'll admit it here with the internet to hide behind br br
<START> it was originally meant to be a film that gene kelly would star in but when the makers couldn't get him they got the greatest actor in the world and the result is pretty good basically nathan detroit frank sinatra is having trouble doing what he does best setting up a high stakes crap dice game because he needs 1000 to get the place so to get the money he needs he has a 1000 bet with old friend sky masterson marlon brando that he can't get sergeant sarah brown great expectations' golden globe winning and bafta nominated jean simmons to go with him to havana meanwhile nathan is having trouble trying to get rid of the woman who wants him to ask her hand in marriage miss adelaide vivian blaine also starring robert keith as lieutenant brannigan stubby kaye as nicely nicely johnson and b s pulley as big jule an interesting romantic comedy musical with brando singing all his own songs and sinatra being smooth and cool it was nominated the oscars for best art direction set decoration best cinematography best costume design and best music for jay blackton and cyril j mockridge it was nominated the bafta for best film from any source and it won the golden globe for best motion picture musical comedy frank sinatra was number 43 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons marlon brando was number 30 on the 100 greatest movie stars he was number 11 on the 100 greatest sex symbols he was number 4 on 100 years 100 stars men sinatra was number 35 and brando was number 1 on the world's greatest actor luck be a lady was number 42 on 100 years 100 songs for the film was number 23 on 100 years of musicals and it was number 36 on the 100 greatest musicals very good
<START> avast slight spoilers ahead i got this tape from my local library which keeps a copy for obvious reasons br br i once went to the town of matewan west virginia and in a little museum there i saw the schedule for the town theatre citra may 1954 movies would change at the theatre each day as there would be no tv for another decade or so in those parts this was much of the available entertainment in the town the raid seems to have been made for towns like matewan in the 1950's although it wasn't listed for that month i am sure showed there some monday or tuesday night for an audience which probably wasn't too demanding the historical raid daring and remarkably successful didn't seem to have been very well researched so the movie is full of hollywood embellishments including a loose cannon played by lee marvin marvin uses the opportunity to practice being liberty valance and st albans seems to have had more yankee soldiers coming and going through the town than washington d c had br br what really made me snicker was when the raiders change into their confederate uniforms only in tacky civil war paintings do rebel uniforms look so pristine when anne bancroft's son catches van heflin in his uniform just before the raid i expected the boy to think it was halloween br br and then there's anne bancroft herself while watching the movie i actually looked on the imdb to see if there was a second anne bancroft the then studio contract actress looks nothing like in her later films and has none of the presence she would later have in the miracle worker agnes of god and of course the graduate br br worth seeing if only 1 you live in st albans and 2 you have a couple hours to kill on a hollywood fictionalization of your home town's biggest news story
<START> a classic series that should be at least repeated or released on dvd billy toth after realising he is adopted after the death of his parents embarks on a journey to find his real parents after various rites of passage his search culminates in the discovery that his fathers identity was stolen and used by a human trafficker in europe if i remember correctly the series ends on the austrian ski slopes and a cliff top chase resulting in the death of billys fathers betrayer this series was all filmed on location in various destinations round europe and appeared polished and incredibly well made with some episodes crossing into the realms of film noir and crime thriller the main arc was often eclipsed by the slices of life that billy went through during his years of toiling to find his mother and fathers secrets a class act but underrated and forgotten
<START> this movie is a mess i'm surprised it even has a theatrical release without robin williams it would have gone straight to video it is poorly written it is poorly directed it's worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and boring thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no inner or emotional logic especially after the first half hour the movie dovetails into a series of ridiculous set pieces that are so over the top that the audience i saw it with was laughing at it save your money the trailer is totally misleading it is not suspenseful and there are no thrills in fact the movie's truly worst offense is that it is simply boring
<START> this movie is great br br now i do tend to like my films heavy on the story and dialogue but now and then something like moonwalker comes along and it's watchable despite numerous flaws br br this film is no more than a highly entertaining michael jackson advertisement beginning with sickly video set to 'man in the mirror' a montage listing his achievements and bits and bobs from his career it goes through all the highs of his life then crashes down into a really really entertaining segment which acts as a funny music video for 'bad' and 'speed demon' following the adventures of mj as he runs from manic stop motion fans and finally dancing against a rabbit costume the stop motion isn't that bad as some would have you believe it's passable br br then we see the great video for 'leave me alone' and straight into the main feature br br yes the plot is laughable very laughable we see michael walk out of a building then get shot at by thousands of troops then we hit flashback showing mj and three children stumbling upon an underground lair 'mr big' joe pesci is the nefarious villain who has a plan to get every child in the world hooked on 'drugs' no specifics are mentioned at an early age mj and the little girl he is with get caught then chased yada yada yada the plot isn't really the important part we get two very cool sequences where mj turns into a car then a robot spaceship thing and of course the amazing 'smooth criminal' sequence br br it's a so so film but it is fantastic for anyone who likes mj it has most of his greatest hits and some cool little bits and some quite good special effects the robot spaceship sequence in particular worth it especially seen as though you can pick it up for about a quid on ebay it'll keep the kids quiet for a couple of hours as well as most 20 somethings who were kids when it was first released
<START> this is a great movie i did the play a while ago it had an extra zing to it i loved vanessa williams as rosey and also jason alexander has a good voice it was great the setting were also very good except the fact that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes makes it pretty long overall i give it 8 5 stars they also added a few parts but it was still cool
