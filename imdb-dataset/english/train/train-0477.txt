<START> a french novelist disgusted by his wife's society friends goes to north africa for a respite there he encounters a vivacious talented bedouin girl living in poverty to spite his wife who is romancing a maharajah he decides to train educate the girl and present her to parisian society as the princesse tam tam br br the marvelous josephine baker is perfectly cast in the title role in this very enjoyable french film with her enormous eyes infectious smile she makes contact with the viewer's heartstrings immediately her over sized personality obvious joy of performing make her a pure pleasure to watch baker makes us care about what's happening to poor alwina during her transformation introduction to european mores br br albert prÃ©jean does very well as the pygmalion to baker's galatea also effective are georges peclet as a half caste servant and jean galland as the mysterious maharajah br br the film is very handsome well made looking a little reminiscent of busby berkeley movies being produced at the same time in america although unlike american films of this period princesse tam tam hasn't any racism it should be pointed out that there was no hays office or production code in france some of the dialogue action is rather provocative but it must be admitted that baker singing dancing to 'under the african sky ' as well as her culminating performance in the parisian nightclub are two of the cinema's more memorable moments br br actual location filming in tunisia greatly enhances the film br br josephine baker was born in st louis in 1906 into a very poor family her talent driving ambition however soon pushed her into moving east and she was briefly a cast member of the ziegfeld follies realizing that america in the mid 1920's held great limitations for a gifted black woman she managed to get herself to paris where she eventually joined the foliÃ©s bergeres le negre revue the french adored her and she became a huge celebrity a short return to america in 1935 showed baker that things had not changed for african americans she returned to france became a french citizen worked for the resistance during the early days of the war baker relocated to morocco for the duration and entertained allied troops stationed there br br after the war baker's fortunes began to slide and she faced many financial personal difficulties for a while she was even banned from returning to the united states finally baker accepted an offer from princess grace of monaco to reside in the principality josephine baker was on the verge of a comeback when she died of a stroke in 1975 at the age of 68 br br having appeared in only two decent films zouzou princesse tam tam baker is in danger of becoming obscure but she deserves her place alongside chevalier dietrich robeson as one of her generation's truly legendary performers
<START> rÃ¥zone is an awful movie it is so simple it seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life just like zappa did many years ago but unfortunately denmark lacks good young actors leon are by many still the little girl in krummernes jul and laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie br br even though i consider it a movie you ought to see i do not agree that the youth are behaving like this but i think it can show how it can end if you are letting your child down also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like film folket br br all in all i think people should see rÃ¥zone not because it is a great film but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes i also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it and actually it is in these scenes laura is acting best like the ending where she is holding the gun
<START> i saw this last week after picking up the dvd cheap i had wanted to see it for ages finding the plot outline very intriguing so my disappointment was great to say the least i thought the lead actor was very flat this kind of part required a performance like johny depp's in the ninth gate of which this is almost a complete rip off but i guess tv budgets don't always stretch to this kind of acting ability br br i also the thought the direction was confused and dull serving only to remind me that carpenter hasn't done a decent movie since in the mouth of madness as for the story well i was disappointed there as well there was no way it could meet my expectation i guess but i thought the payoff and explanation was poor and the way he finally got the film anti climactic to say the least br br this was written by one of the main contributors to aicn and you can tell he does love his cinema but i would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise br br i took the dvd back to the store the same day
<START> spanish films are into a if not golden definitely a silver age piÃ©dras is another example of a movie that takes people and their conflicts seriously although the feelings are strong or nearly at life or death level they still aren't really melodramatic this could happen br br there are different stories here which become connected one is about the retarded girl who doesn't dare to pass the street to the next block one is about the middle aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fetischist another is about the girl with drug problems who's lover leaves her still another one is about the madame of a brothel who almost finds true love br br definitely worth seeing it's in spain the moviemakers take women seriously
<START> personally i absolutely love this movie and novel i read the book first and decided to see the movie first of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind the acting is also great and i love the cast judd crandall plays fred gwynne fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you there are also a few corny lines thrown in there idk if they were meant to be corny but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh the maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie not only will you love it but you'll want to see it again and again i recommend this 100 to any horror fan
<START> this astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians from a silly play by tennessee williams and directed with a dead hand by joseph losey and starring taylor and burton and noel coward this project filmed in a spectacular cliff top mountain island mansion in the mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to universal in 1967 the result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set the shrill antics of a screeching taylor burton's half asleep wanderings the loony dialog noel coward laughing at himself the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer boom is a disgrace a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet's plebs not even fun just terrible and mad shocking waste
<START> this movie is a little unusual in that it's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace while this makes it pretty different from the average grant film it is still highly watchable and entertaining it's sort of like someone said let's just follow cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from myrna loy and melvin douglas the film works very well while the film has pretty modest pretensions it makes the most of the material it's a great film for cary grant fans or for the whole family
<START> robert forster normally a very strong character actor is lost at sea here cast as a new york family man seeking revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion scary subject matter exploited for cheapjack thrills in the death wish vein it isn't difficult to scoff at these smarmy proceedings the dialogue is full of howlers the crime statistics are irrevocably dated and the supporting characters are ridiculously over written particularly a despicable judge who allows an accused murderer to walk right out of the courtroom low rent production is contemptible in its self righteousness especially as the violence in our cities has only increased from
<START> 79 100 fred astaire and ginger rogers never made anything but great films together although this is not one of their best it is an excellent musical there are a few outstanding musical numbers good support from randolph scott two notable appearances betty grable and lucille ball make memorable early screen performances ball is particularly good and a blonde as well the let's face the music and dance is one of the musical duo's best numbers ever harriet hilliard better know as harriet nelson of ozzie and harriet plays ginger roger's sister the basic plot is pretty familiar but with a cast this exceptional it works excellent art direction and score
<START> this has to be creepiest most twisted holiday film that i've ever clapped eyes on and that's saying something i know that the mexican people have some odd ideas about religion mixing up ancient aztec beliefs with traditional christian theology but their day of the dead isn't half as scary as their take on santa claus br br so santa isn't some jolly fat red suited alcoholic take a look at those rosy cheeks sometime rather he's a skinny sociopathic pedophile living in heaven or the heavens whichever with a bunch of kids who work harder than the one's in kathy lee gifford's sweat shops they sing oh so cute traditional songs of their homelands while wearing clothing so stereotypical that i was surprised there wasn't a little african american boy in black face singing 'mammy' this santa is a peeping tom pervert who watches and listens to everything that everybody does from his 'eye in the sky' this is so he can tell who's been naughty or nice with an emphasis on those who are naughty i'd bet br br there's no mrs claus no elves what does he need elves for when he's got child labor and the reindeer are mechanical wind up toys this floating freak show hovers on a cloud presumably held up by its silver lining br br santa's nemesis is the devil what is this santa our lord and savior weird anyhoo satan sends one of his minions a mincing prancing devil named pitch to try to screw up christmas let me get this straight the forces of purest evil are trying to ruin a completely commercial and greed driven holiday seems kind of redundant doesn't it br br pitch is totally ineffectual he tries to talk some children into being bad but doesn't have much luck i was strongly struck by the storyline of the saintly little girl lupe who's family is very poor all that she wants is a doll for christmas but he parents can't afford to buy her one they spent all of their money on the cardboard that they built their house out of so pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll in reality that's the only way that a girl that poor would ever get a doll because being saintly and praying to god and holy santa doesn't really work but lupe resists temptation and tells pitch to get thee behind her and so is rewarded by being given a doll so creepy looking that you just know that it's chucky's sister br br along the way pitch manages to get santa stuck in a tree uh huh from whence he's rescued by merlin merlin you have got to be kidding me since when do mythical druidic figures appear in christmas tales or have anything to do with a christian religion and doesn't god disapprove of magic they'd have been burning merlin at the stake a few hundred years ago not asking him to come to the rescue of one of god's aspects or that's what i assume santa must be to be going up against satan this movie is one long huh from start to finish and it'll make you wonder if that eggnog you drank wasn't spiked or something probably it was since this movie is like one long giant dt
<START> dressed to kill is brian depalma's best film an absolute thrill ride of suspense humor and style that remains unrivaled today depalma has a bum rap in hollywood as most people claim that he rips off alfred hitchcock he does not hitchcock could only dream of what depalma shows in his thrillers br br sadly the original uncut version of dressed to kill is no longer available on video the current copy released by goodtimes is the jack valenti approved r rated cut but some copies of depalma's original cut still exist it is the one distributed by warner home video in both a green cardboard box with angie dickinson on the cover or in a black clamshell case with the theatrical poster on silver lining these are the ones to get if you can find a copy i have the green one and it is among my treasured possessions br br anyway back to the story dickinson plays kate miller a sexually frustrated wife who is being treated by dr robert elliott michael caine for her obsessive fantasies while on a trip to the museum a real tour de force for depalma in terms of camera work and suspense br br miller is picked up by a stranger you can pretty much guess what happens to her since the ads and box art give away the story but there are a few complications a hooker nancy allen is the sole witness to the murder kate miller's son peter keith gordon is a teenage genius determined to solve the crime and dr elliott's answering machine has a certain message on it about a missing razor br br i'm not spoiling the film at all for you since what i have described above takes place within the opening half hour and depalma's biggest surprises are reserved for the last hour this film is explicit however enough for valenti head of the mpaa to demand cuts in the film what surprises me is what cuts he wanted several cuts in the opening shower scene and one or two slashing scenes and some of nancy allen's dialogue valenti wanted cock changed to bulge this is a film that is very violent and bloody yet the objections are to sexual content i'd love to hear valenti's explaination at how seeing two women in a tender love scene in lost and delirious is somehow more damaging to a young mind than arnold schwarzenegger blowing away people with a chain gun it just isn't fair br br what makes dressed to kill so good is that not only are the technical credits first rate but the performances are very good as well michael caine who was in a lot of crap in this time period gives one of his best performances as the doctor angie dickinson is better than usual possibly because she actually has a strong role here nancy allen adds this to her range of performances that has her pegged as one of the most underrated and overlooked actresses in the world keith gordon is wonderful as the genius and i loved all those inventions of his br br depalma is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition he deserved the recent joke of the afi 100 best thrillers list showed that very few people actually know what a thriller is if they were to actually open their eyes for once they would see that depalma has staked his career in thrillers and is actually the best craftsman this is even better than psycho it's a shame that very few actually know that br br out of 4 stars
<START> boom has garnered itself a something of a reputation with heavyweights taylor burton noel coward tennessee williams and joseph losey one might be tempted to think how bad could it be well it's a lot worse than you could possibly imagine br br the sad and disturbing fact of boom is that is seems to signal the decline and fall of the aforementioned heavyweights it was only director joseph losey who having plummeted the depths with modesty blaise and boom some may wish to add secret ceremony managed to recuperate and in 1970 create his best work the wonderful go between br br saddest of all is the work of tennesee williams from the mid forties until the early sixties williams penned a number of plays which have gained classic status remaining in theater repertory throughout the world many becoming much praised films when william's muse deserted him probably owing to his notorious substance abuse it deserted him for good williams at his best is an actor's dream providing many unforgettable performances were ava gardner or deborah kerr ever better than in night of the iguana taylor in particular shone in both cat on a hot tin roof and suddenly last summer there is an anecdote in which supposedly taylor asks john gielgud whether he would teach her to play shakespeare to which he replied if you will teach me to play tennessee williams had gielgud seen boom he would have held his tongue taylor simply has never been worse turning in a cringe inducing performance despite her face photographing well she is decidedly podgy besides the physical decline from this time onwards she would basically lose credibility as a serious actress with a string of completely forgettable and worse roles to her credit br br much the same could be said of burton following his short lived theatrical stardom he won fame and fortune in hollywood but the body of his work from this point onwards 1968 would be unremarkable to say the least br br noel coward had long ceased being a force in the theater where his drawing room comedies had been replaced by the likes of williams and the british angry young men he seems to be enjoying himself camping it up but barely manages to amuses that from the man who claimed such a talent br br the only cast member who maintains her dignity is young joanna shimkus who in a few years would forego a promising screen career to become mrs sidney poitier br br boom reeks of self indulgence it's simply out of control a rather sad pointer to careers gone wrong rather than a camp fun fest as some have suggested
<START> this is an awful film yea the girls are pretty but its not very good the plot having a cowboy get involved with an indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didn't get in the way well okay it might be interesting but its not because its so badly paced and and only partly acted i can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen probably more laughable then they do on tv i won't even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest never read about that in the old west this is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward br br i like schlock films but this is ridiculous there is a reason that i don't go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good the plot taking a back seat to breasts the original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats the clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent the comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level infantile but harmlessly fun something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie br br the ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film br br i need not watch this again br br of interest to probably no one the rapist and killer in the film was played by bobby beausoleil a member of the manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped br br obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives
<START> this first part of the brd trilogy has more passion and plot density than lola but less of the magic of veronica voss the political musings have point to them we see the shortages after the war how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day to day life delicious moment when fassbinder playing a grifter tries to sell a complete set of kleist to schygulla who remarks that burning books don't provide much warmth she really wants firewood br br there's some clumsiness in the first hour the scene in maria's room with the black soldier interrupted by hermann's appearance should go quicker the train scene when maria meets karl oswald falls flat when she insults the gi i cringed it was so bad but as the story develops and the years go by i was drawn more and more into this glossy cold world
<START> mr michael jackson is an artistic phenomenon his short movies i e music videos are simply the best i do not care if i get a sane sci fi feature from this man but i do care to get a medley of his crazy dancing shriek yells cool crowd choreography and some bits of cgi and animation there also should be a few uninterrupted videos everything i've mentioned is here stupid plot and over the top vanity fair are not a problem when i witness mr michael jackson in action to me he will always be the ultimate king of music videos not king of pop which sounds moronic especially for us russians because pop sounds like the russian word for arses and mj is definitely not king of arses i can re watch his best music videos which are artistically beautiful and i never get tired of them br br my first impression of this film was what is this bits of different videos some drawn images unsettling jumps from one theme to another absence of any cohesive plot line some kids fooling around etc but as i watched it till the end i could tell that it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on tv nowadays what i like here too is that it never shows any shameful material and can be watched by kids easily br br without mr michael jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor even the best classic videos of other artists cannot come very close to the energetic hyperbole of mj musical insanity and artistic quality he knew how to get the audience of different ages and he knew how to remain a man with moral principles br br when i see a proper dvd release with mr michael jackson videos i know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release history i history ii and moonwalker are all great though only moonwalker is more like one movie with a solid smooth criminal theme paparazzi topic and a few weird spoofs and twists br br being no fan of mj i can still give this film like no other a solid 9 out of 10 i've been hit by smooth criminal for sure and my major complains are the following initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main mj anti drug campaign should have been given more sky rocketing insanity and stress and there should have been more moonwalking itself of course thanks for attention
<START> the husband and wife team of bennie fields and blossom seeley were huge stars in vaudeville yet they made very few films as is the case for some other performers of their era george m cohan fanny brice gertrude lawrence the most accessible piece of film footage for fields and seeley is the biopic about them in which they're portrayed by other actors 'somebody loves me' starring betty hutton and that inimitable song and dance man ralph meeker br br in their heyday fields and seeley were so hugely popular that another husband and wife vaudeville act jesse block and eve sully achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act effectively becoming the second team fields and seeley offstage though there was a major difference in the couples' living arrangements fields and seeley lived in hotel suites paying room service rates for every meal they ate and eventually running out of money block and sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely ending in comfortable retirement br br the first 30 seconds of this vitaphone short are occupied by two spats wearing pianists apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in 1930 although i've never heard of them finally fields and seely rush in and start performing they both have plenty of pep and she's fairly attractive br br i was annoyed that both performers keep making movements as if they're about to break into a dance but they never quite do so until the third of the three songs they perform in this short when they finally start hoofing the results are not impressive br br i was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act now that i've seen it i understand why they never became stars in movie musicals my rating for this one just 4 out of 10 and i'll stick with block and sully
<START> twisted desire 1996 was a tv movie starring melissa joan hart melissa's character jennifer stanton a seventeen year old seduces her current boyfriend nick ryan into murdering her two parents the movie is based on the 1990 murders of the parents of 14 year old jessica wiseman jessica had her 17 year old boyfriend douglas christopher thomas shoot and kill her parents thomas was executed in 2000 jessica was released from prison when she turned 21 years old evidence now suggests that it was jessica who fired the fatal shot that killed her mother jessica is known to now be residing somewhere in the state of virginia
<START> i first heard of unisol 2 when i drove past a cinema when i was on holiday in america i really did not take much notice of it until i bought the original on dvd which led me to find out about its three sequels i subsequently started to read about the return on the imdb and asked friends what they thought of it despite their horrific criticisms of it i still went out of my way to see it and was on the brink of buying it until i saw it for hire on dvd i wasn't expecting much but thought that it must have been half decent to get a theatrical release in the us after all how often is it that you see van damme on the big screen well nothing could have prepared me for this it is so bad i almost cried what a total waste of 80 minutes and Â£2 50 it is hard to explain how bad this move is honestly this is idiotic film making no it's more than idiotic i just cannot believe how this got made i cannot believe that someone out there has not murdered mic rogers how stupid can people possibly be firstly van damme actually thinking the script and finished film was good secondly the fact that xander berkley of terminator 2 and air force one status commited himself to this film i simply cannot believe the stupidity of this movie it takes itself so seriously but comes across to the audience like a spoof here is an example jcvd's daughter yes luc is now a human again i want my daddy seth so do i oh yeah and some guy tries to shut down seth by pulling three huge levers with wait for it on and off written on them the acting all round is like playschool acting i'm sure mr director modelled luc's reporter girlfriend on april o'neil from the cartoon teenage mutant hero turtles she refuses to go because she ' needs her story' i mean come on how many cliches can a film possibly use please listen to me fellow imdb users don't touch this with a barge pole to conclude universal soldier the return has no relation whatsoever to the first movie in fact if they weren't called unisols then you would never know it was a sequel luc is now a human again what the hell the only place in which he can access the internet is in a stripclub all the new uni sols look like they were dragged off the street they are that unconvincing this is pure torture to watch so do yourself a favour don't torture yourself p s best part of the movie romeo jumps off a building and shouts 'oh sh t'
<START> ugh where to begin first campbell scott's non stop angst becomes a real turn off after awhile a very short while as he internalizes his mounting anguish curiosity and anger only we don't care these characters as presented by the writer and director are wholly unlikable and therein lies the key they haven't given us anything to make us care if they are adulterous and whether or not they are still in love with one another when scott quietly tells his wife i could kill you before their three daughters at the dinner table after the shock of his selfishly poor timing wore off i almost wished that he had and then done the same thing to the smug wisecracking apparition of denis leary before being hauled off the the looney bin an utter waste of time and perhaps only perhaps resources
<START> first of all do not call this a remake of the '63 film even though this version is truer to the stage play it is extremely long the casting was good with some exceptions chyna phillips was not a good casting choice she was almost 30 when she did this film and it was hard to believe she was a teenager jason alexander was good choice but after a while he gave me a headache tyne daly overdoes her part as mae peterson george wendt was funny as harry mcaffee and showed he could even hold a tune like the '63 film they casted an unknown to play conrad birdie marc kudisch had fun with his role as birdie and it showed i even have the soundtrack and i love listening to his singing so what made this a tv ratings flop it was lengthy for one they put in new songs and scenes even though some of the new songs were good like let's settle down was it really necessary now don't get me wrong i liked it but i rather watch the '63 film see my review this was just a case of some actors overdoing roles making some changes and once again length one more thing i forgot to mention is vanessa williams she does a good job with the role and the music give her any lyrics and she could sing them so here is my advice coming from someone who's done a couple productions of bye bye birdie if you want to watch an entertaining take on the play watch the '63 film if you want to watch a version that is truer to the play watch the '95 version just take it in moderation though don't be a hero and try watch it all in one sitting
