<START> heh if i tell you to compare the dark knight with some 18 years old comics adapted movie rated 5 9 will you call me crazy that's just to catch your attention everyday i meet people complaining there are no good movies who seem to only know the recent blockbusters it's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies especially those with good artistic values dick tracy is one of those can't be easily outdated in terms of technology br br the negative reviews mainly complained about dt's messed up story but it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear and i had no problem following it i didn't see the comic books yet i am not a huge us comic fan but i appreciate the top notch film making and performances maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell but if you see a movie casting madonna and warren beatty together what would you expect i had some scratches on my head and can't help but wonder did we really see the same movie the title role although not as competent as it sounds still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences madonna was more express less than breathless in her seductive role but added a lot of fun to the story al pacino was funny and prodigy to himself apparently he's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles we can see a hybrid of scarface michael corleone adolf hitler and robert de niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh and many thanks to make ups br br to me it's not bad at all the surreal feeling really got me
<START> it's rare that i feel a need to write a review on this site but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created and how bias its product was br br i felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film makers to display the palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy we hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the jewish israeli population we see no evidence that parallels the position of the palestinian teenager we only hear from other palestinians in prison i understand restrictions are in place but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace br br i came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence so to speak she continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber's parents and her angry and closed minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control it is more realistic in my mind to see the israeli mindset to be a root of the problem ignored pleas for understanding and freedom ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the jewish population acquired the land br br i have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother which normally would be admirable in a documentary however in the light of the lack of impartiality it all seems exploitative also for the poor edits lack of background in the actual instance and finally the lack of proper representation of the palestinian side ultimately it is a poor documentary and a poor film i acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heart wrenching and sad subject matter
<START> the big goodbye introduces us to the first holodeck adventure in this case captain picard posing as private investigator dixon hill this episodes creates some sort of standard pattern repeated several times on tng as well as ds 9 and voyager after entering the holodeck something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under different circumstances beyond playing a game represented by the failure of the holodeck's safety program br br this concept is used to expand star trek's possibility and enabling a kind of genre mix picard's dixon hill stories are examples of 1940s crime fiction and their representation on the screen are referred to as film noir often having the stereotype antihero in the lead see for example chandler's marlowe stories or polanski's all time classic chinatown star trek never focuses on the story mostly it's a simple how do we get out of here scenario but enables the actors to take a different approach to their characters those holodeck games are commonly used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members therefore the technical aspect is always neglected and from that point of view the stories are never sound but did star trek ever had a technical scientific point to it i mean besides some utopic concepts br br the big goodbye shows a relaxed patrick stewart a mcfadden that hardly ever looked better in a star trek episode at least the early ones and data has some great scenes too although i find it hard to believe that pulling the lamp's plug out of the wall would have really surprised him for the fact that he'd done research on that period and its customs wesley continues turning peaceful trekkies into potential murderers why didn't they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters finish him off but all in all this one's fun
<START> this really is the worst film i have ever seen ever period i actually paid Â£3 50 to watch this steaming turd of a movie incredibly dull poorly acted dire script often incoherent and too many scenes that don't seem to have any relevance to the overall film like when heath ledger's priest partner get's nailed to a wall by a ghost what was the point in that scene answers on a postcard please br br i should have got a medal for sticking with this film for it's entire running time i would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film again br br this should be cast into imdb's bottom 100 hopefully my vote of 1 10 will help it on it's way
<START> this batman movie isn't quite as good as batman mask of the phantasm and batman and mr freeze subzero but it is still a good installment to the batman cartoons i say it is equally good as batman beyond the movie this movie is good for all the same reasons the storyline is good not quite as good as the other one's but still pretty good it has lots of action in it the cartoon effects are good the voice of actors are really good such as kevin conroy as batman bruce wayne tara strong as barbra gordon efrem zimbalist jr eli marienthal as robin the villains are good such as kyra sedgwick as batwoman david ogden stiers as the pequin hector elizondo as bane so i am sure you will not be disappointed with batman mystery of the batwomen so make sure that you rent or buy batman mystery of the batwoman the movie because it is really good br br overall score out of br br out of
<START> in some ways the concept behind the storyline was a rather interesting blend of several typical movie types in an interesting combination however no point in this movie was so obvious that it did not deserve lingering close up shots i felt as though i had been beat over the head with the so called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people br br the writer appears to have simply lifted clichÃ©s from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters the actors did not help matters no chemistry i guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories however the writers didn't work very hard to develop the chemistry sure they're both attractive but whether they're attractive to each other seemed to be an open question br br the confidence turner's character shows in sabato's developed far too quickly and for no particular reason sabato's character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who just can't seem to play by the rules think of the jeff goldblum character in independence day usually that kind of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent or brilliance sabato's character does not he's cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic skills of a magic eight ball he appears to be right by random chance br br the death scenes are comical every actor was really trying more than a little to hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them the symptoms looked like bad claymation sort of like that video from the 80s peter gabriel i think
<START> this film does not fail to engage and move even in 2008 to an audience only familiar with modern over produced sound and computer enhanced techniques br br the experience of the movie goer in 1922 who could only see this in a cinema with others on their big screen must have been truly profound and a thoroughly satisfying experience br br one has to ask could a film maker today make a two hour silent movie and make it interesting and achieve the same structure tempo and balance as this movie has silent film making was pure art it had to hold the attention through its structure direction and acting there was no padding out with more words or computer generated distractions a poorly made or uninteresting silent movie is unwatchable br br this film needs to be put into context for those who might be disconcerted with the mention of christian themes this is not a 'christiany' film it is not selling anything these themes along with reference to current moral standards often appear in this era also church going on sundays was a national past time christianity was a given in most households thus the film is only depicting normal life as it was then the themes would have rung true and deep at the time br br it is most odd given the strong support to good christian thinking of this particular movie and it is not preaching religion to anyone only highlighting the difference between hypocrites and the honest that in 1922 a pastor in an open debate with a representative from the film industry with a large crowd denounced pickford as an example of immorality along with some other individuals he named ny times 1922 br br maybe they should have watched this movie that also came out in 1922 and learned some lessons br br the pastor complained that since the film industry had started church attendance had dropped 500 000 the film representative in the debate however made the following observations that saloon attendance had also dropped that there were far more pastors in prison than actors fact and that selecting a few examples from among the many was not representative of the whole br br thus there was an ongoing battle between church and the film industry during the early days of film br br this is a wonderful film about being honest and true to family friends and to be willing to make sacrifices mary pickford naive honest feisty full of happiness and joy faithful humorous and silently sacrificing though poor and uneducated she represented the perfect character this however is not thrust down our throat but revealed bit by bit through the film br br this is reminiscent of some modern chinese films where characters are slowly languidly revealed over the course of a film and it is this tempo that creates a stronger connection with the character br br it has a smooth even tempo for the first half that builds all the elements for the last section the last 30 minutes are great film making and it has to be appreciated it was achieved without the benefit of sound running dialog it was achieved through deft acting and great directing it is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the film you haven't hear a word spoken but it feels like you have heard everything br br the supporting cast put in great performances especially gloria hope jean hersholt and lloyd hughes br br the final few minutes are typical pickford understated humor as she goes outside under the pretext of sweeping the snow a near perfect balance and ending this is a special type of touching humor that should not be underestimated chaplin used this device often and copied some of from pickford br br another special observation to be made about silent films and especially pickford films is that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the movie without the audience becoming jaded or bored with the actors over exposure that pickford is usually thoroughly the center of attention through most of her movies but the people still couldn't get enough of her is a testament to her fine acting ability
<START> this is unlike any other movie the closest thing i can compare it to is a woody allen film but where as woody allen is constantly fathoming human foibles bret carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to grips with that one crippling insecurity that tends to define us for better or worse in the case of lou it is the root cause of his stuttering which can be traced back to a singular child hood trauma that is revealed through flash backs br br there are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and i believe they all deserve a chance for redemption although diversity of human character is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place so maybe we shouldn't fix our neurosis anymore than we should fix our noses or breasts br br this is an indie film shot on a long shoestring but the production values are tremendous as is the scope of the film i feel like its a quirky gem for the self help market i really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next i could imagine a career along the lines of woody allen or albert brooks although usually when a guy like this breaks through he goes off and makes x men and his humble quirky origins are soon forgotten or are they x men is aout a bunch of freaks if i remember correctly
<START> first it takes a full half hour to get hackman out of jail and to start doing the job what a waste of time we all know hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences then hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere simply proving to us that hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters again another 20 minutes then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife all of this should have taken 10 15 minutes at most simply as a set up for the real action intrigue and plot twists by the time the real action gets going i was so bored that i just wanted the movie to end hackman is great as usual and the other actors as well but this is a dud of the first magnitude
<START> actually one particular person character isn't right there but my summary line is referring to the power of the movie and this is all achieved without any fancy camera moves and or big production sets but with a great story and very believable and good actors conveying the story arc br br you could call it a companion piece to great japan movies cinema such as tokyo story etc not so much story wise of course but more mood wise great acting nuances in the performances that are truly gems if you're eager to experience a touching story and want to see a movie touching you emotionally than this is the one to go as you have noticed as with many of my reviews i'm not getting into the story there are places here at imdb where you can look those up i'm not one to spoiler the story whatsoever
<START> from the mind of robert bloch of psycho fame come four tales of twisty terror in this amicus anthology film which while not quite as much fun or scary as i would have liked still provides for some decent genre entertainment br br it's linked by the wrap around story of a highly skeptical scotland yard detective john bennett who is investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor he's advised that this case is linked to a few others by the house in which they all took place and our film is off and running br br method for murder has author charles hillyer always delightful denholm elliott haunted by his latest fictional creation who has seemingly come to life this sequence has some good surreal and fairly suspenseful moments and is capped by a reasonably amusing revelation and denouement br br waxworks stars horror icon peter cushing as retired stockbroker philip grayson who along with old friend neville rogers joss ackland becomes obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a macabre wax museum most effective in this episode is the dream sequence although it's great as always to watch cushing the final images presented to us in this story are pretty shocking br br sweets to the sweet features another well loved horror star christopher lee as john reid who doesn't treat adorable moppet child jane chloe franks with too much kindness and it's up to new companion tutor ann norton nyree dawn porter to find out why the mystery of this particular episode is handled excellently the film makers wisely don't tip their hand so it comes as more of a genuine shock as we get the full truth of this unhappy family the dying moments are particularly horrific br br the cloak has the most outright comedy of the four jon pertwee one of many actors to have played the role of dr who over the years is a lot of fun as a vain temperamental horror movie star in fact he's the highlight of this story who infuriated with the lack of quality in his latest low budget film goes out and buys his own cloak said cloak has strange powers which i dare not reveal here sexy ingrid pitt is a welcome presence as pertwees' companion one wonderful example of the humor here is a knowing jab taken at none other than christopher lee br br the wrap up story then concludes in a predictable but still effective way as detective inspector holloway learns that he should have taken all of the warnings given him more seriously br br underscored by michael dress's unusual striking and eerie score the house that dripped blood is an entertaining mix of stories while i don't enjoy it quite as much as say tales from the crypt it's still good fun capably directed by peter duffell it moves slowly but surely towards each of its chilling conclusions and is certainly a good film of its type br br 7 10
<START> having not seen this film in about 20 years i am still impressed with it 's hard hitting impact and stellar acting of course one mr mickey rooney is indeed incredible in his role as the ring leading killer in reference to another review here none other than orson welles evoked mickey rooney's name as the greatest movie actor also i also recall the jazzy brassy score and the bare black and white photography i love the mick's last line before he goes out for his dose of lead poisoning i think the stranglers lifted it for a line in one of their songs get a grip on yourself this is a great film and unjustly buried film let's get it out side note a recent film review magazine gave a big write up on don segal's babyface nelson made a couple years before last mile and also starring mickey rooney another rave of the mick's intense and sympathetic performance perhaps it's the start of a groundswell of a appreciation for some truly superior cinematic performances
<START> i entered the theatre intending to pass a pleasant 90 minutes being entertained if not enlightened i left neither entertained nor enlightened this movie can't make up its mind what it wants to be and ends up being not much of anything there are a few funny lines and a few incredibly pretentious movie references the 400 blows for this character come off it while none of the characters gets treated with much respect the over thirty gay men get the worst of it all predatory fat sad slobs if you're in the mood for a movie dealing with gay relationships check out parting glances longtime companion trick all over the guy red dirt maurice philadelphia instead you'll thank me br br
<START> sometimes lady luck smiles on me i had originally made and copied over a vhs tape of this wonderful tv presentation i was heartbroken when i realized what i had done since i had been unable to obtain a copy of it anywhere else br br recently i subscribed to digital cable and while searching through upcoming movies there to my surprise was a scheduled broadcast of the movie this time however i made a copy of it to dvd so there's no chance of repeating my mistake br br i finally got to watch it again after eight years and it was just as exciting and tense as when i first saw it there is a little bit of prelude to this story in that my first contact with pandora's clock came with a live reading of the book on public radio i just happened to tune in to the broadcasting station on my way home for lunch and from the first installment i was hooked each day i waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be read br br when i learned a few months later that the book was going to be broadcast on tv as a movie i made sure to clear my schedule for that event br br first of all i'd like to say that the movie was very true to the book contrary to what another reviewer had said that in itself is a rare achievement for tv movies br br secondly i agree with others about the casting i could not imagine a better choice for captain holland than richard dean anderson literally the movie could have crashed and burned without a proper cast for this pivotal role anderson has never been better and it is a shame that we have not seen more of him in fact all of the cast members did a superb job br br my only complaint with the movie and the book was the interjection of the terrorist plot to arm a private business jet with air to air missiles and have its pilot stalk and shoot down the stricken plane basically we are talking about less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this one and folks that is just not realistic at all given all the players involved also not realistic was how little the airliner was affected by having first one then two of its engines blown off br br that beef aside i enjoyed the building suspense and found to be very believable how the reactions of foreign governments were portrayed in the film as well as our own br br if you have an opportunity to see this movie do so by all means
<START> i know i've already added a comment but i just wanted to clarify something br br i'm not some old fogey from the baby boom generation that grew up glued to a flickering b w picture of phil silvers jackie gleason etc br br bilko was already 20 years old before i was born but i had the pleasure of discovering phil silver's bilko courtesy of bbc2 i wonder if i would have enjoyed steve martin's travesty if i hadn't seen or heard of phil silvers i don't know maybe i would have br br some of the other reviewers who think this movie is worthy of a '10' admit that they haven't seen the original i can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode if after watching the original ernie colonel hall ritzig emma duane doberman henshaw dino flashman zimmerman mullin et al you still think that steve martin's film is woth anything above a '2' i'll stand you a pint
<START> this movie seems to have a lot of people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time after having just viewed it i can say it does not live up to those claims br br the idea of the movie is indeed demented but overall the execution wasn't at all cringe worthy even the final scene the eyeball thing isn't really that nasty i was expecting something insane instead it was of lower quality than gore put forth on films like the ultra low budget violent sh t br br any one wanting to see an actual movie will be disappointed since there is no story whatsoever though surely most people know this gore fans will be disappointed since contrary to belief the blood and guts here are few and far between not to mention the actress playing the victim might be one of the worst in history br br regardless of what people say this movie isn't that shocking it just plain all out sucks avoid it
<START> i am a sucker for films like this films that take you back and let you relive your childhood i'm a grown up now and have many grown up responsibilities like a mortgage kids dogs a wife and a slew of others i enjoy my life but it is not as innocent and carefree like it was when i was twelve mike binder's indian summer knows this and explores this like he was twelve years old it brings you back to a time when life was simpler and much more fun it brings you back to a time when worrying about your first kiss and wondering if you could finish the camp marathon were important issues indian summer is a fantastic film and it is one that should be watched at least once a year just so you can sit back and laugh and reminisce br br the film stars kevin pollak bill paxton diane lane and matt craven to name a few as childhood friends that are being summoned back to camp tamakwa by their former head camp counsellor uncle lou uncle lou is played perfectly by alan arkin he is kind of guy who is the patriarch of the group he is also all knowing and encompasses the true spirit of a father figure and someone who understands the simple things in life he has a hard time relating to today's kids that need a walkman blaring in their ears when they are at a place of immense beauty like tamakwa this is a camp that has moose wandering through the camp leaves turning colours that god gave them and water for as far as the eye can see uncle lou yearns for the days of old and asks his former campers back to the camp to see one of them will take over the camp while they are all together again we get to see their trials and tribulations and perhaps a new love could spring between them br br as the adults return to the camp it isn't long before they act like kids again as the typical camp pranks get played all over again they take toilet paper out of the stalls the put toothpaste on sleeping bags and so on all of this is done hilariously and with actors like pollak and paxton it is all very funny stuff br br but beyond the hilarity we get to explore some very real adult emotion that anyone can relate to in one of my favourite scenes kevin pollak and elizabeth perkins are overlooking a bay where they used to go canoing as kids pollak can't get over how small it all looks and perkins finally tells him that the bay didn't get smaller they just got bigger it doesn't hammer the point home but it does it subtly we all grow up we all move on and we all unfortunately can't live like we did 20 years ago the more things change the more they stay the same br br indian summer is a character driven film and it is written beautifully by mike binder who actually did attend camp camp tamakwa as did sam raimi who played stick in the film and it is his fond and vivid memories of his experiences that fuel the film there are many touching scenes and there are many hilarious ones also both are perfect br br i love this film i love everything about it and it is a true hidden gem br br 10 10
<START> great woody allen no good woody allen definitely i found myself along with the audience in attendance laughing hard and often at some of the best woody allen lines we've heard in a while the aging allen created an appropriate role for himself as scarlett johansson's father well sort of some have said johansson plays a young dianne keaton i beg to differ she plays woody's dialogue which in his comedies always has a very similar feel like well a woody allen comedy that's fine for us woody appreciators she certainly did woody's dialogue far better than the young cast of his last comedy melinda melinda some may find woody's humor tiresome but for those of us who love it when it's done right we look forward to the next
<START> how in the name of all that's holy did this film ever get distribution it looks as if it has been shot on someone's mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths they literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie and that's all they do there is no plot no tension no characters and not a lot of acting just screaming and more screaming br br i gave up after fifteen minutes and fast wound through it to see if anything happened it doesn't except for screaming of course odlly enough the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem there is no camera work to speak of every shot looks like every other shot middle distance one angle dull dull dull br br it's not so bad it's good it's just plain bad
<START> the film is very complete in what it is keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder one simply cannot go wrong the very plot in itself the very story and essence of the film is entertaining it is the sort of story that the director bill paxton could do so much with and in this case he really did do a lot with it br br from beginning to end you are kept anticipating more and more about what is happening and where the film is going and the creativity that is behind this story is first class i felt as if this film was exquisitely done from start to finish and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring lulls the action flowing neatly quickly and tightly from one scene to the next br br it demonstrates just how far people can go so as to do such horrible things to their loved ones and to do such acts of evil in the name of 'god' when they are disillusioned as in this case it also is sometimes interesting in its' twists takes on the concept of morality as a whole br br overall this is the sort of film that one easily overlooks but i would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out it is very much so worth your time
