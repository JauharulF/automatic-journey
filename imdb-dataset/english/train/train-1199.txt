<START> the college girl murders is my first acquaintance with the writing work of edgar wallace Â and generally my first real acquaintance with krimi films in general Â and i can say that i'm moderately impressed this stuff is really entertaining although i never would have expected it to be so Â goofy the film has an exhilarating and nicely convoluted plot with a healthy dose of humor flamboyant twists and pretty inventive killings there's some james bond type of evil mastermind Â who always sits in the shadow and in front of a large monitor recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison there's also a villainous monk with a whip dressed like a communist kkk member getting rid of the leftover characters like overly curious teachers and such as well as a kooky police commissioner who persists on solving the case with a psychological approach seriously if i had known sooner that these krimi films were so colorful and crazy i would have purchased a whole collection of them already the pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it answers in the end and the overload of comical gimmicks on the account of scotland yard inspector higgins are sometimes a bit much to swallow but i don't care because it was sublime entertainment even the funky 60's soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time it's like a variant on the italian giallo but with slapstick elements
<START> if you think weird al yankovic is hilarious you won't be disappointed by the compleat al not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of yankovic's more memorable videos like a surgeon and i love rocky road among them but they are inter spliced with funny vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist's rise to fame yankovic is not for all tastes but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non fans will at least be lightly amused die hard fans will love it not only for its content but also for its relatively early look into yankovic's now nearly three decade career suitable for all ages kiddies will no doubt love the funny visuals
<START> in joel schumacher you have one of the most inconsistent film makers of all time but this is common knowledge i think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur hitchcock liked his suspense and his horror thriller chaplin liked his comedy scorsese likes his crime driven mafia stories amongst others and spielberg likes his large scale big budget adventure films that combine just enough violence for the adults and fun for the kids other more obscure examples include kubrick and welles who covered too much to write about here br br but schumacher is the sort of guy who makes a flawed film revolving around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolving around a seemingly dull premise falling down had a great idea behind it but i found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy batman is a superhero superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me then comes 8mm a film with a basic premise that is executed in an impressive manner before tigerland which is schumacher's best film from what i've so far seen in my opinion with the war genre laughter isn't something you'd associate with it for most of the time i can remember scoffing at the absurdity of the d day landings during saving private ryan at the time when i first saw the film i had not much knowledge of the second world war bar when it began and finished my eyebrows were up my mouth slightly open with a weak 'i can't believe it smile' on my face needless to say it was because of that film i searched out learning a bit more on what that event was all about and the war as a whole in tigerland you are invited to laugh at the absurdity of war through bozz farrell a tough and egotistical soldier training for the vietnam war br br but what's clever here is that there are no jaw dropping war scenes of fighting and death and destruction just one man and his battle with the system for most of the time the things he says and the audacity at which he deals with his predicament is reminiscent of a school child winding up a series of teachers at an extremely strict boarding school tigerland may borrow from full metal jacket in the sense it is a training routine for the vietnam war but egos and superegos play more of a part here i think the superegos that are the drill sergeants go up against bozz whose ego is extremely large there is also the third part of freud's triangle that sneaks into bozz the id compared to all the other soldiers who all have rather large egos bozz is the only one brave enough to show it in front of the sergeants thus suggesting he is allows what he shouldn't do to float to the surface and express itself you are all dead in this situation barks a sergeant any questions yeah if i'm dead how come i can ask a question replies bozz whose punishments such as push ups and dirt eating seem to un faze him in true id style that is he enjoys the punishments br br also regarding the superegos bozz at one point tries to command a group of soldiers in field training this is something the existing captain of the squad cannot do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the superego required for the job and the confidence to tell bozz he is in charge what follows is an actual conversation between bozz and an existing drill sergeant who gives him his christian name this is where private wilson's whigham character steps in his uncontrollable rage and anger at bozz explodes at certain time all culminating in the film's only real scenes of a shootout which is in the form of a training exercise in a river wilson cannot control his impulses and dislike toward bozz and acts out br br what i also liked about tigerland is that it's shot in such a way that is brave while lacking in innovation tigerland seems to use lower grade film stock or lesser cameras to get across its gritty look make no mistake that this could have been a pretty looking film with lots of colour and attractiveness but we get a documentary approach in the final piece making everything look like it was shot on a typical everyday camera for tv the emphasis on the hand held is also apparent but schumacher is clever he never allows the film to become too much like a mockumentry whilst at the same time suggesting the film's budget could've been half of what it was it's worth saying here that spielberg said he wanted saving private ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those lines and as if it was recorded from the war scenes br br while being very funny and entertaining tigerland is still a great study of what makes people tick not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute its study on one man and how much he hates the system that he cannot even take it seriously is fascinating as is the drive of each soldier there are several memorable scenes and situations culminating in a happy if not unhappy ending that'll open your mind and make you think about what it's perhaps really like in the military
<START> okay this film is about bedknobs and broomsticks it's one of the most charming delightful movies you'll ever see as a kid it's the unforgettable movie about two adults and two spunky kids on an adventure for fun it may be a little deniable to watch but try it i neither my mother didn't think it was bad i was very enthused with the movie and the animation they were all quite good br br it is a delightfully wondrous comedy for the whole family to enjoy even the kids ages 7 years and up will enjoy this wonderful musical comedy with you and your family especially the animation the animation movements and layouts are really nice and deserve a thumbs up it's a terrifically good musical for the whole family so what are you waiting for go to the video store and rent bedknobs and broomsticks now
<START> i watched this film a few times in the 90's and nearly split my sides laughing each time i love eddie murphy as an actor but this stand up is some thing else he is so funny even the p c brigade would find this hilarious it's a must watch and even better if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink the take off of michael jackson is so like him if you close your eyes you believe it's him singing the things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was not funny my local video stores do not stock this video any more but i would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour anyway highly recommended hope you enjoy
<START> and not in a good way baseketball is a waste of film in all most every single way it is offensive to all the senses this doesn't necessarily bother me i've seen plenty of bad movies really bad movies before and will see them again baseketball though is a caliber film where you regret wasting ninety minutes of life sitting through it the reason baseketball offends me is that it stars trey parker and matt stone in a film they didn't write any respect i had for david zucker has long since depleted his recent spoof films are lazy messes that look and feel as if they were made by pre pubescent boys snickering at penis jokes airplane was a revolutionary and very funny comedy watching baseketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person br br i have so much respect for trey parker and matt stone these men are the funniest and smartest comedians in mainstream entertainment today their pictures and south park episodes are as relevant as they are funny every joke even the fart jokes have intelligence behind them it's easy to forget that there is a mature way to approach immaturity i imagine baseketball was a major growing experience for them because they hate the film for all the right reasons it is a stupid mess with no sense of dignity or class parker and stone have essentially whored themselves out the film plays like a 90 minute episode of family guy br br parker and stone have never been great actors they've been serviceable in their films i can't really find a way to describe their performance in baseketball other than the fact that it feels like they are spoofing a spoof film spoofing a spoof film every line is delivered in such a silly winking way it's like they are trying to make fun of the worst of these type of pictures and yet they become them in the same way i am reminded of the south park episode how to eat with your butt where cartman sits in a movie theater watching a gross out comedy with no plot or plausibility except to gross out parker and stone use the same voices they did in that scene for this entire picture really it's sad br br and yet that is not my problem with baseketball my biggest gripe with the picture is that i sit there knowing that parker and stone are knowingly following this piece of crap script i know that if they took the damn thing and rewrote it that this could have been salvaged to the point of being watchable there isn't any indication that zucker let them improv scenes either parker and stone are merely tools to a bad director baseketball has some funny concepts and i think parker especially if he were allowed to take zuckers script could have elaborated on them more instead we get potty humor don't rent baseketball you can get the same laughs watching a group of grade schoolers joking around
<START> this movie probably had a 750 budget and still managed to surpass titanic i rented this the day i crashed my mom's car and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief it has to be tied with 'the assult of the killer bimbos' things to look for are 1 the drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2 the bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3 the flinstone like screech out driving 4 the clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed don't worry i'm not ruining any surprises for it's soooo predictable 5 the guy who finds it necessary to howl 6 the mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen 7 the hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest 8 the womman writing grafitti on the bathroom wall 9 last but not least the wonderful special effects especially the stab in the boob that made a heaven help me popping noise br br enjoy br br
<START> bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors lorne greene pernell whitaker michael landon dan blocker and even guy williams as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace adam when he was leaving the series the cast had chemistry and they seemed to genuinely like each other that made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have it also made many of their best stories into great western drama br br like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season there are bound to be some weak ones however most of the time each episode had an interesting story some kind of conflict and a resolution that usually did not include violence while bonanza was a western the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction while i am a fan of the rifleman and wanted dead or alive those shows usually ended with a gunfight gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict and bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing br br in the early years of bonanza there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series but they are pretty good in and of themselves in 1964 when pernell whitaker wanted to leave the show guy williams was brought in to replace him williams was playing the role of a long lost cousin unfortunately whitaker decided to stay one more year and thus williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry adam's old girlfriend if williams had stayed on for the duration of bonanza one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965 when pernell whitaker left the show br br undoubtedly once pernell whitaker left the series the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes and his absence left a void in the cast little joe always wanted to play the nice kid and hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold since ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family that did not leave too much room for any gunfights br br at some point they hired a ranch hand called candy david canary who became their fourth member of the cast but candy was never featured in any gunfights and he was hardly more than an older version of little joe for a year or two they also had ben take in some other lost cousin jamie played by the forgettable mitch vogel who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone br br apparently by adding the teenager the studio was looking to attract younger viewers it also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems alcohol delinquency etc those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counter culture movement dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order tv though hawaii 5 0 the f b i and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing tv shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief mayhem and crime br br the addition of a teenager to the cast gave the cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general after dan blocker died the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled the last season was pretty bad as it featured little joe tracking down the killers of his wife and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because little joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife and how unfair it was that she was killed br br i don't think i have ever seen the last episode of the series and i wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way by the last year there was only ben lorne greene actually living on the ponderosa as adam had moved away and never came back even once as a guest and hoss had died and little joe had left after his wife in the series had been killed by drifters br br overall the era from 1959 1965 is the best of this series once adam left it slowly declined most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too by 1970 the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical and it had lost a lot of its western flavor the addition of candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show and the death of hoss dan blocker was the final nail bonanza is probably the best western series ever made and of the 465 episodes that were produced at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama that is a pretty good record even the worst of bonanza is better than a lot of other tv shows
<START> released in december of 1957 sayonara went on to earn 8 oscar nominations and would pull in 4 wins red buttons won the oscar for best supporting actor in his role as airman joe kelly who falls in love with a japanese woman while stationed in kobe during the korean war oscar nominated for best leading actor marlon brando plays major lloyd gruver a korean war flying ace reassigned to japan who staunchly supports the military's opposition to marriages between american troops and japanese women and tries without any success to talk his friend joe kelly out of getting married ironically marlon brandos character soon finds love of his own in a woman of japanese descent this movie highlights the prejudices and cultural differences of that time filmed in beautiful color and with stunning backgrounds i found this movie to be well worth watching just for these effects alone good movie gimme more gimmeclassics
<START> director brian yuzna has had an uneven career in the horror genre creating masterpieces such as return of the living dead 3 or bride of re animator but at the same time he has done awful movies such as faust love for the damned or the mediocre progeny he is obviously better in the seat of producer where his work producing stuart gordon's films has been superb br br the dentist is one of his lesser works as director but the low profile it has benefits the film and its lack of pretensions makes it a very enjoyable experience it tells the story of dr alan feinstone played superbly by corbin bernsen a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life is not really as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife linda hoffman has an affair with the pool boy this event disturbs his mind and puts him in a killing spree as he takes revenge on the world for being so filthy br br the premise is very well handled by yuzna as he takes us on a ride following feinstone's day of revenge what makes this movie different from most slashers is that we are not in the victim's perspective we follow feinstone because he is the main character we witness how he goes from respected professional to psycho murder in a day yuzna manages to give the movie the exact amount of suspense but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the movie br br most of the success of the premise is in bernsen's performance as feinstone he can make you feel sympathy and hate towards him at the same time and the subtle humor his character has is another aspect that aids the film the rest of the cast is not as good and i think that their sub par acting hurts the film more than it should a notable exception is ken foree as the detective trying to catch feinstone while his part is quite small he makes a great job with it br br with a dentist as killer gory scenes are expected and brian yuzna delivers great sfx in the correct amount it's good to see that he does not go over the top with it as he usually do and i dare to say that this is a highlight of the film it has the exact amount of gore that is expected nothing less and nothing more yuzna restrained himself of his common excesses and the result is great br br while this is not among yuzna's most well known films i would say that it is one of his best sure it is not classic material as his masterpieces but it is a movie that entertains and never gets tiresome or boring it is a low budget simple film but for what it is i think it rocked 7 10
<START> i was waiting to see this movie from a long time it's promos gave a fair idea about the content and when i finally saw it i really find it was quite well made most of the conventional romantic movies end with the lovers finally getting married or start of with a happy life after marriage but there is really a great adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new relation and life this is what this movie is all about the period when a newly wed couple fardeen and esha get married through an arranged marriage and start off their life with their honeymoon the acting is really spell binding though i think esha remained a bit quiet and she could have used some lines for herself the story was well knitted and dialogs were more or less appropriate the editing and direction were also good meghna gulzar really did a good job here to summarize i would say it is a good drama cum romance a true combination of what bollywood can offer a clean entertainer
<START> anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series the borg does not come around until q brings the enterprise to the gamma sector the klingons are never seen until kirk encounters them the ncc 1701 was the first ship to carry the enterprise name need i go on berman and pilliar have made a mockery of gene roddenberry's creation after he died they only saw and just went their own way no wonder majel barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series i don't blame her for not being involved with this mess poor bakula he's a great actor as are the entire cast i like them all but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series just check the ratings i think more people watched deep space 9 which was untimely canceled
<START> this cecil b demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean arthur's finest performance as a hysterical eccentric incurably amoral but devotedly doting calamity jane she really pulled it off gary cooper is at his most taciturn but manages some occasional pithy sayings 'the plains are big but trails cross sometimes ' the story is a pastiche to end all pastiches all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james even abraham lincoln opens the story in person or at least demille would have us believe so there is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety this is a 'stomp 'em in the face' tale for the masses a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what eisenhower was eventually to name 'the military industrial complex' it isn't just a story about gun runners but about arming anyone for money and doing so from the heart of washington but let's not get into politics let's leave that to demille who can be guaranteed to be superficial the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george antheil who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography 'bad boy of music' antheil seems to have originated 'the big sound' adopted by all subsequent westerns whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies that is why it does not sound at all unusual because we have heard it a thousand times but he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into american mythic lore and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then corny as it may be but doubtless appropriate it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a cheyenne indian gabby hayes is in there somewhere but you miss him in the crowd gary cooper overtops them all looming large but when did he ever loom small
<START> basing a television series on a popular author's works is no guarantee of success yorkshire television learnt this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to dick francis three of which were broadcast under the collective title 'the racing game' mike gwilym was sid halley a former jockey turned private eye following an accident in which he lost his right hand only to have it replaced by an artificial one gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma and looked like one of the bad guys while mick ford who played the irritating chico barnes made me think of a horse's arse whenever he was on screen for six weeks this less than dynamic duo charged about the countryside foiling nefarious plots to fix races usually by the same methods blackmail kidnapping riders or doping horses yorkshire television threw money at the show but to no avail violent sexist far fetched and repetitious it was quickly carted off to the knackers yard
<START> this is really terrible br br the only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie i have ever watched i would have a suitable reply br br i think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell i wouldn't have bothered commenting but i noticed some fanboys probably connected to the movie had claimed that this was the best movie since the matrix let me debunk the myths and lies br br there is nothing good in the movie everything yells tacky the actress is ugly the fight choreography is the worst i have ever seen the fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn't hurt a kitten obviously the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie br br i know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before unforgivable
<START> much in the same way frank miller and his sin city comics used black and white to express itself and its film noir influences so does christian volckman with renaissance br br it is the year 2054 in paris in the tradition of science fiction the future is a bright sparkling multi teared jewel this is a jewel in a setting of misery inequity and darkness bright and beautiful on top with a dark underbelly beneath one of these bright people at the top a research scientist from a very large and influential global company avalon is kidnapped the well known and efficient captain karas voiced by the new james bond himself daniel craig is assigned the task to find her br br the plot and layout is not overly original it is heavily influenced by film noir gibson's neuromancer and other detective stories along with movies like blade runner sin city fritz lang's metropolis and minority report there is the main plot surrounded by other possible sub plots that all connect at the end it is not hard to figure it all out br br the movie's strength and originality is in its intense visual presentation paris is an intricate array of levels and sub levels at its base is the more primitive industrial infrastructure as the city rises so does its architectural complexity and luminescence yet in this structure the top does not equate with elevation of human ideals and behavior paris has been intricately animated and laid out in brilliant black and white the movie is closer in spirit with sin city the comics then sin city the movie was with its source material this is done all the more easy because it is still remaining in relatively the same medium animation much in the same way as a scanner darkly pushed the visual aspects of story telling so does this the light and dark black and white creates an atmosphere of contrasts as well as visual ambiguity right and wrong black and white can lose all meaning at the same time it is right in front of us the movie proves how black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious at the same time br br in keeping with the spirit of the movie i can be both critic and fan i can love and loath in the same light it is definitely an experience i recommend for lovers of the visual arts so pour another black and tan enter the void and enjoy the ride
<START> in the recent movement to bring asian films over to america this is the last movie that should be released here being a big fan of asian movies from all genres i was browsing the net and came across this soong to be re released into the us market so i decided to check it out ahead of time and rent this at a local video store br br trust me the action scenes are incredibly disappointing crouching tiger and iron monkey completely blew this movie out of the water jet li would fall asleep watching the fighting sequences if you're looking for martial arts entertainment your time would be better off with a jackie chan flick br br moreover you think you're going to watch a martial arts with about a girl engulfed in vengence for her parents death but surprise a good hour of this movie in the middle has is filled with dialogue an absense of action the lack of devloping a tangent plot pretty much nothing to do with the premise we are exposed to it has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer director dedicated no time in elbaorating and yet dedicated a portion of the film dragging the issue would of been much better off if they had just cut that whole hour and developed the story in itself through another film and focus on the martial arts aspect br br speaking of which i really don't believe the choreographer of iron monkey did the action sequence in princess blade i was completely insulted in the frequent usage of slow motion and quick camera changes to portray the assassins physical swiftness i just didn't buy it br br please i'm warning you to please do not waste your time money with this movie the premise is intrigueing and the trailer might even tempt you but i am positive that this movie is not suited for the public maybe in japan but not in the states and will be the worst film brought over to the states from the asian film industry
<START> really good horror flick featuring to of the greatest boris karloff and bela lugosi dr janos rukh karloff is on an expedition in africa trying to find an ancient meteorite after finding it rukh is poisoned by the its radiation all he touches dies and the dark side of rukh makes him become an egotistic murderer his friend dr felix benet lugosi finds a limited remedy to the problem and at the same time realizes the radiation could be used for the good of mankind by curing diseases the two fiends will battle over the radiations possibilities pretty good special effects others in the cast frances drake frank lawton beulah bondi and frank reicher
<START> some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good 23rd century films released dozens of obscure italian and american movie that were great but although hardgore released some fulci films amongst others the bulk of their output is crap like the zombie chronicles br br the only positive thing i can say about this film is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the stink of flesh other than that its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a lego house built by a whelk br br it's been noted elsewhere but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks you've seen it all already br br bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18 000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast especially the hitchhiker who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit and kudos to hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like i was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip br br awful awful stuff we've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere avoid
<START> much of over her dead body is so painfully unfunny that i was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors br br eva longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy and further that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing she's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancÃ© the fiancÃ© is played by paul rudd drippy and charmless while the psychic is played by lake bell bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has i felt most sorry for bell as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work unfortunately she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features jason biggs tolerable and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like leo dicaprio at the end of titanic br br over her dead body actually pi ed me off because of its laziness and utter lack of effort i started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this seriously does hollywood think movies like this are good enough how stupid do they really think the movie going public is br br grade f
