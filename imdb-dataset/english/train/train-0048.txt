<START> some critics found this film bleak but for me there was enough good humour and optimism to overcome this impression for example the quietly positive and stoic character of the daughter is the still centre of the film often counterbalancing the unhappy aspects of the setting and plotline br br the film is full of original ideas and characters and the final outcome is not predictable i felt it could've gone either way br br by the way many reviews i've read mention the effective use of black and white but the print i saw shown on the sbs tv network here in australia was in full colour br br
<START> so todd sheets once stated that he considers his 1993 shot on video z epic zombie bloodbath to be his first feature film anyone who's ever seen a little beauty called zombie rampage knows exactly how untrue that statement is i mean what makes this one that much more superior well then again zombie rampage doesn't include that mullet guy now does it br br for one to comprehend exactly why zombie bloodbath is actually considered worth a damn one must remember what the 90's were like for lovers of bad horror a decade that all but said goodbye to b and z cinema as we knew it technological advances awkward trends and the internet would abolish the mysterious charms of the s o v 's big boxed golden years and anything remotely resembling quality schlock was all too self aware for it's own good basically defeating the purpose luckily not everyone changes with the times enter zombie bloodbath br br and i guess this is the part where i explain the same exact premise from 500 other zombie flicks from the last 40 years alright so some kind of accident at a nuclear plant infects everyone in sight turning them into flesh eating zombies who go on a rampage inflicting some of the most gruesome yet humorous gore scenes of the 90's the first 20 minutes are cluttered with the most awkward sounding conversations you could imagine conversations that let you know that this isn't just a low budget zombie flick this is a z grade disasterpiece fella plenty hysterical non existent acting to go around and that goes triple for mr mullet that guy is truly the highlight of the night br br the fact that todd sheets seriously considers zombie bloodbath to be that superior to zombie rampage amuses me to no end i mean really both are complete jokes on celluloid but then again so is redneck zombies so obviously todd sheets is in the company of awsomeness by 1993 a movie this bad would no doubt be a full blast spoof but mr sheets stands his ground giving us some good old fashion schlock the way it was meant to be unaware clueless and pointless god bless todd sheets for anyone seeking surprisingly worthwhile 90's b horror leif jonker's darkness should be at the top of your list as for zombie bloodbath if you're a gorehound who got bored sometime around 1990 then '93 would be the perfect time to pick up 8 10
<START> in any number of films you can find nicholas cage as a strong silent hero dennis hopper as a homicidal maniac lara flynn boyle as a vamp tramp and the late lamented j t walsh as the heavy these are the types of roles these four can play in their sleep and they have done so often enough that to see them playing them again borders on cliche what a relief therefore that john dahl a master at getting a lot of mood out of a little action directed this nuanced noirish thriller hopper manages to keep from going over the top cage shows a little more depth than his usually superficial action heroes boyle is by turns sultry innocent and scheming and one gets a sense of the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character wayne dahl's direction gives a sense of the emptiness of the big sky country where the story takes place while also being intimate enough to show how a wrinkled brow can indicate a radical change of plot in store the plot twists are top notch and one of the other great twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they have brains it isn't often that minor characters like deputy sheriffs have more brains than their headlining superiors but with a director as smart as dahl you shouldn't be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected with this film an excellent movie
<START> although the casting for this film was admirable particularly dianne keaton and tom everett scott the quality of the writing was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this film worth watching br br my wife and i decided that the reason we watched the entire film was that it was like a train wreck and it was almost impossible to turn away it may have been that we hoped that the message would eventually make itself apparent and that we would be able to glean some meaning from this effort unfortunately this did not happen br br of course the audience may have been able to make sense of this convoluted tale a credit to the ingenuity of the human brain to make sense of the absurd the writers however did nothing to facilitate this innate need we seem to have for finding meaning br br it was apparent that those involved were simply going through the motions of their respective crafts and that any intrinsic passion for the characters or the story was either secondary or non existent br br unfortunately made for tv movies have seemed to devolve over the years whereas communicating a message to the audience may to have been the primary interest of the writers in the past present day writers and producers seem condescending to their audience concentrating primarily on manipulating us to stay tuned through the incessant advertising which seems to be the only reason movies such as surrender dorothy are made
<START> when he remade broadway bill 1934 as riding high 1950 recasting bing crosby as dan brooks did not help a screenplay that was 'dated' in 34 let alone 50 this sad film has entire scenes lifted from the original with many of the supporting cast repeating their roles unless they were dead though being older did not seem to matter to the director nor that the cars and clothes in the background plates from 1934 did not seem match up too 1950s' standards not even 'der bingel' singing can redeem this effort br br we rated both the original and the remake imdb four stars frank's touch was long gone and all that was left was capra corn that did not stop mr capra though after floundering around the 50's making some educational documentaries he wound up his career remaking lady for a day 1933 as pocketful of miracles 1961 again a fine cast was let down on that imdb six star effort compared too the originals eight stars sometimes it is better to quit while you were still ahead right after state of the union 1948
<START> bad stuff this movie is real crap bad stunts for one thing they looked so fake i thought this was the twilight zone the flashbacks are pretty much useless one part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better i wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the acting even from the adults was horrid a kissing scene in this movie even sucked this movie killed the book the book was great i highly do not recommend this movie not even for educational purposes br br good stuff i don't know what i can say really there is some suspense parts that get you going but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting br br my verdict do not watch
<START> a decent sequel but does not pack the punch of the original a murderous screenwriter judd nelson assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel cabin by the lake still ruthless killing but movie seems very tongue in cheek any humor is not of the funny kind total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times nelson is way over the top this movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen this should have happened to this script
<START> it's getting worse the series is on a serious down fall the first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really really terrible movies robert englund gives another great performance as freddy but the rest of the cast can't act the story is alice having survived the previous installment of the nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again this time the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of alice's unborn child his intention is to be born again into the real world the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son check out the first three miss the next three then watch the last one
<START> it's a shame that this piece of work wasn't acknowledged as a piece of work it has everything a historical film must have a serious historical research outstanding performances of every actor involved and a discrete but great direction br br when i saw the movie i knew it should be a prototype for every biographical movie
<START> this is the only movie i have ever seen that has prompted me to write a critique on any internet site and that is a significant statement from someone who likes the attack of the monolith monsters this movie is perfect for anyone who wants an inoffensive movie it is devoid of sex and violence for example i believe that this movie is safe for children of all ages this movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained challenged or stimulated in any way adults could easily catch up on their sleep in front of the tv while the kids watch this movie don't be surprise however if you wakeup to find the kids have turned the tv off and started a board game as an adult who enjoys being entertained who enjoys everything from the mundane to the fantastic in realism drama comedy and action all of those adult things that reflect real life on earth and or stimulate the imagination this movie has nothing to offer
<START> hollywood does it again lots of money no creativity i'm sure the writers were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this one based on the previews i thought that this would be a funny movie but if you are not up on the latest stupid pop culture then you'll miss most of the silly humor in this movie why waste your time you can sit on a log doing nothing and have more fun than this movie will provide br br
<START> i loved dewaere in series noir his talent is trivialized in the waltzers aka going places okay it's a couple of guys flaunting convention in the most absurd and irredeemable ways many folks find such behavior amusing this was a boring pointless exercise designed to shock i find the smirk on blier's face the face behind the camera annoying series noir was a valid expression of personal liberty and licentious behavior from the first moment when we see patric dewaere prancing in the abandoned lot we get an idea of the bewilderingly beautiful anti hero we'll be spending time with for the next couple of hours when we see him chasing the hapless middle aged female with his buddy depardieu in going places we have fair warning that two hours spent with these chaps will be soul draining i have trouble eking even a 3 for this annoying distraction
<START> spoilers br br i'm sure back when this was released in 1958 it was much appropriate for its time back then films were slower paced to allow audiences to follow and analyze the story here a man moves into a house owned by his last wife that died mysteriously with his new wife the gardener mickey played by alex nicol who also directed he film really is an underappreciated character he gets a skull to indirectly warn jenni that she is in trouble since he knew that there was foul play in the first wife's death he can't tell jenni directly what happened so he tries to scare her off with the skull jenni we also find out saw her parents die thus causing a lifetime of mental anguish that lead to institutionalization like many audiences today i found the pacing to be a little too slow for my tastes but if you like slow paced horror without a lot of gore this film is for you br br
<START> even though it has one of the standard revenge price plots this film is my favorite of vincent price's work gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters likeability when you watch it you feel for him you feel his frustration the injustices against him and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance even though he frightens you a little with his original fury as the film goes on his character becomes tragic he's committed his murder but now he must kill to cover that up and again to cover that one up and again your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood even if the revenge story is of old the plot devices themselves are original gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways a shame this one isn't available for home veiwing
<START> darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman with odd ties to elvis presley running into a sea of elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in nevada and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own kim basinger a still attractive actress of considerable merit likes to pick quirky movies to play in but this dreadful screenplay by mitchell ganem and adam michael garber hasn't an iota of good humor the stereotypes and low ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy but even on a shambling shameful level the picture is crude and sloppy if you do watch see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink cadillac hands always in the same position and a non plussed look on her face hopefully both she and elvis were well paid no stars from
<START> it seems as if in science fiction you have this periodic throwback to perform an odd phenomenon that appears in long serial novels it's where the first novel dune ender's game blows you away with an actionpacked revolutionary story the sequels however take that universe and lead you down the garden path to whatever new little social or political commentary the author wants to make the matrix is finally the film equivalent the matrix stands tall alone as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle seeing this cash cow just sitting there and wanting to explore other aspects of society the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most painful monologues and non action sequences in scifi while the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies the new explorations of the characters falls terrible flat in the sequel watch for eye candy not for deep thought br br 4 out of 10 as registered by this fine website
<START> a very close and sharp discription of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of specialy one 18year old guy that makes his first experiences in his gay love to an other boy during an vacation with a part of his family br br i liked this film because of his extremly clear and surrogated storytelling with all this sound close ups and quiet moments wich had been full of intensive moods br br
<START> this one hearkens back to the days of the matinÃ©e when kids with nowhere else to hang out took their dates to the balcony after dumping their younger siblings below it didn't matter what was on the screen the little kids would sit through it and the big kids would ignore it the adults of course would never see it br br but they put it on video anyway along with most of the other creaky low budget b horror flicks of the golden age of television this film's inherent and unintentional humor is derived from stale ideology the bad girls harvested to replace poor jan's crushed body they had it comin' overused plot a mad scientist trying to play god violent yet conscientious monster whose presence in the heretofore normal seeming scientist's rural lab is never fully explained and acting that polarizes at wooden or over the top br br this is a great party film assuming your guests enjoy adding dialog and commentary to otherwise abominable cinematic exploits in fact should you or your guests prefer more passive entertainment this film is also available on video in its mystery science theater 3000 treatment in which the host and puppets of the cult tv series make the necessary additions for you
<START> the script for this movie was probably found in a hair ball recently coughed up by a really old dog mostly an amateur film with lame fx for you zeta jones fanatics she has the credibility of one mr binks
<START> welcome to collinwood is a lot of things but it is none of the following br br a george clooney star vehicle unfunny un original br br and yes i know the basis for the movie is another movie but as far as hollywood goes this may rank with their most authentic outputs this decade and for me it does br br the movie is from start to finish an absolute gas here's why br br there isn't a bad performance in the film the funny parts are funny the edgy parts are edgy the script contains not a dull moment of dialogue the cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful and it doesn't conform to the hollywood norm you'll see what i mean when you see the film br br when i was a kid i remember seeing advertisements for the film this film went under the radar after not grossing much at the box office and isn't even a cult classic the reason why transformers 2 is seen as acceptable by average movie goers is because they are used to seeing transformers 2 if film's as original and funny as this were pumped out as often as multi million pieces of s t the cinematic experience would be a much fresher place br br when 'they' say they don't make em like they used to 'they' didn't see welcome to collinwood br br a fun mini masterpiece of caper comedy that refuses to compromise one of my favourites
