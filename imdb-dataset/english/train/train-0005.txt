<START> i am a great fan of david lynch and have everything that he's made on dvd except for hotel room the 2 hour twin peaks movie so when i found out about this i immediately grabbed it and and what is this it's a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and foul mouthed and unfunny maybe i don't know what's good but maybe this is just a bunch of crap that was foisted on the public under the name of david lynch to make a few bucks too let me make it clear that i didn't care about the foul language part but had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have all in all this is a highly disappointing release and may well have just been left in the deluxe box set as a curiosity i highly recommend you don't spend your money on this 2 out of 10
<START> whoever wrote up redline as a great car movie must be getting paid off by daniel sadek to promote this ultra crappy flaming steaming pile of amateur crap easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made this makes showgirls look like citizen kane br br take every cheesy clichÃ© out of an 80s action tv series put in some really crappy special effects and lame characters with no relevance and you have living proof that daniel sadek should not write screenplays and produce movies but should remain in the real estate business br br this is such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most contrived action sequences ever what offends me is not that the makers of this film are idiots but that they consider the movie going public to be idiots enough to fall for this crap
<START> near the closing stages of baby mama one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it 'was all just a mess' i really couldn't say it any better than that and while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone's time a lacklustre cast mundane script and vague caricature characters ensure that baby mama certainly isn't taxing on the ol' noggin but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour consisting mainly of very routine clichÃ© jokes based around an odd couple rich and poor trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic br br as a story on finding love it's not that bad but playing this plot line as a side story of sorts to work alongside the comedy orientated odd couple tangent characterisation is notably weak resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles as characters themselves both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness so while we may eventually come to find the character's interactions with each other amusing at times the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles we don't feel for the characters and don't find them inherently interesting but rather their dynamic unfortunately however although this dynamic works best or at least better than the individual personas as mentioned above it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd couple formula br br kate tina fey is a successful business woman who has hired working class dumb blonde angie amy poehler to be her unlikely surrogate and after angie decides to leave hopeless husband carl dax shepard both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences yes it's the typical odd couple premise and one that we have already seen in this year's what happens in vegas yet what baby mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi layered characters kate and angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air in fact the movie's only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of romany malco who gets lumbered with playing a door man of the few times that i laughed during baby mama most of those moments were because of this man and the remainder usually fell to shepard br br it's a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script's themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera and yet director michael mccullers goes from page to screen effectively enough yet for a film about babies multi million dollar business and cultural stereotyping this isn't necessarily a good thing baby mama is grade a hammy plastic tinsel town with capital bore topped with sugar so not only did i feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two dimensional nature but i simply didn't care for the world they inhabited the dialogue along with sets costumes and the script's general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director's incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy these aren't characters and that isn't our world in any wayÂ so why should i care at the end of the day however a romantic comedy's ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests and the frequency of its laughs baby mama has little going on in any of these departments of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair i'm sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored in this respect baby mama avoids being unbearable but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch baby mama is too light headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining br br a review by jamie robert ward http www invocus net
<START> film starts in 1840 japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide it's a very gory bloody sequence then it jumps to present day well 1982 to be precise ted edward albert wife laura susan george and their annoying little kid move to japan for hubby's work they rent a house and surprise surprise it just happens to be the house where the murders took place the three dead people are around as ghosts the makeup is hysterically bad and make life hell for the family br br sounds ok but it's really hopeless there's a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between there is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious they look so fake i swear i saw the strings pulling one along and they're muttering there's a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes probably just to show off george's body another one about 40 minutes later but that was necessary to the plot and a really silly exorcism towards the end the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believed br br as for acting albert was ok as the husband and mcclure was pretty good as a family friend but george as always is terrific in a lousy film she gives this film a much needed lift but can't save it i'm giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing that aside this is a very boring film
<START> corbin bernsen gives a terrifically intense and riveting performance as dr alan feinstone a wealthy and successful beverly hills dentist who's obsessed with perfection when he discovers that his lovely blonde babe trophy wife has been cheating on him and the irs start hounding him about tax problems feinstone cracks under the pressure and goes violently around the bend director brian yuzna working from a suitably dark witty and demented script by stuart gordon dennis paoli and charles finch exposes the seething neurosis and psychosis bubbling underneath the squeaky clean well manicured surface of respectable affluent rich america with deliciously malicious glee moreover yuzna further spices up the grisly goings on with a wickedly twisted sense of pitch black gallows humor bernsen positively shines as dr feinstone he expertly projects a truly unnerving underlying creepiness that's right beneath feinstone's deceptively calm and assured veneer the supporting cast are likewise excellent linda hoffman as feinstone's bitchy unfaithful wife brooke earl boen as smarmy meddlesome irs agent marvin goldblum molly hagan as feisty assistant jessica patty toy as perky assistant karen jan hoag as jolly office manager candy virginya keehne as sweet gawky teenager sarah ken foree as thorough no nonsense detective gibbs tony noakes as gibbs' equally shrewd partner detective sunshine michael stadvec as womanizing stud muffin pool cleaner matt and mark ruffalo as on the make sleazeball steve landers the first rate make up f x are every bit as gory gross and upsetting as they ought to be the polished cinematography by levie isaaks boasts lots of great crazy tilted camera angles and a few tasty zoom in close ups alan howarth's spirited shuddery score also hits the flesh crawling spot an enjoyably warped treat
<START> this film is advertised as a clever romantic comedy it is neither clever nor romantic and it is definitely not an effective comedy the fortunes of the well meaning yet pathetic character tom oscillate from one extremely embarrassing disaster to another the only saving graces are the competent performance by toni collete and the frequency with which we glimpse paltrow's pleasant face overall to be avoided
<START> this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real world the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film school br br i do not recommend this film to anyone who a knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations b knows any detail about film making or appreciation br br i do recommend this film to the average or below average mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend some kind of inebriation br br it is a total waste of what little production value it has
<START> sometimes a film comes along that is unique the nostril picker is one such film the nostril picker is like no other film i have ever seen unfortunately for the nostril picker myself it's unique for different reasons than what the filmmakers had originally intended read on all shall hopefully become clear the nostril picker as it's commonly know although it was apparently filmed under the title the changer starts with some extremely dull shots of an american town somewhere streets factory's that sort of thing as the opening credits play when the nostril picker begins proper we the viewer that is are introduced to a real loser named joe bukowski carl zschering who is in his 40's he lives on his own in a crappy little apartment where he watches t v eats beef flavoured dog food listens to old vinyl records as he dances with a blow up rubber sex doll joe likes teenage girls he has various porn magazines but enjoys the real thing even more however being an ugly git joe can't tempt any young ladies to go out with him or do anything else with him for that matter one fateful day an old homeless vietnam vet horace grimm sees the agony pain that joe has to go through actually he sees joe being spoken to by the cops for hassling a teenage girl decides to help him out he tells joe about an incantation that he learned from the 'gooks' in vietnam that will transform joe's appearance into whatever he likes a process he calls morphosynthesis but at the same time he warns joe that 'it makes you crazy if you do it too much' that night joe decides to give it a try in a public place on a podium for some reason joe says a few words does an extremely silly dance starts yodelling joe finishes off by whistling london bridge is falling down listen yeah i ain't making this up either at first joe is visibly disappointed when nothing significant happens to console himself joe tries to buy a porn mag but is shocked when the clerk kevin devoy refuses to sell it to an underage girl joe the bright spark that he is realises what has happened talks his her way out of it by claiming his her dad had sent him her to buy it joe who now calls his alter ego josephine ann flood senses the possibilities heads straight for the local high school joe befriends four teenage girls jennifer armstrong laura cummings crisi stroud gail didia tracy harper heidi m gregg brenda kearn aimee molinaro while under his disguise oh joe manages to become a pupil at the school simply by asking the sports teacher miss van dyke vicki hollis at first joe seems harmless enough he just likes to hang around the girls toilets stuff like that but things soon change as joe brutally murders brenda jennifer's dad vince armstrong edward tanner is a detective so along with his partner ed simpson clyde surrell walt spencer bruce alden the pathologist is determined to catch the sicko responsible for killing his daughter's friends but will they succeed before joe strikes again the imdb listing for the nostril picker is wrong i watched it mere hours ago it clearly states that it's directed by mark nowicki who was also a co producer definitely not patrick j matthews who was credited as a co producer the cinematographer not that it makes much difference i'd have though that nowicki would have been more than happy for matthews to take the 'credit' for making this piece of crap no one involved in the making of the nostril picker should be allowed to go anywhere near a camera again ever the nostril picker is easily one of the worst films i've ever seen that's saying something it's absolutely terrible in every possible way imaginable the script by steven hodge is atrocious there's no narrative structure excitement tension drama character development the things that do happen are so mind numbingly dumb it's untrue the plot devices chain of events in the nostril picker are totally incomprehensible the scene where joe finds out the prostitute steven andrews he hired is in fact a man joe starts to chase him around his apartment with two squirting dildo's is simply jaw dropping stuff the subsequent scene when the transvestite reports the incident to the police is hilariously written had me psychically laughing at the dialogue i hated the ending as well not only was it predictable but it leaves the door open for a sequel i psychically shudder at the mere thought on a technical level the nostril picker is awful point hope photography bland inappropriate music forgettable locations poorly edited brenda is killed in the kitchen yet her blood splashes on the t v screen that was clearly in the opposite room some of the worst acting i've sat through very unimpressive special effects which consist of a few cut off rubber fingers a slit throat a quick scene where joe eats some flesh it comes as no surprise that the cast crew who worked on the nostril picker have virtually no imdb credits for anything before or after even at 76 odd minutes the nostril picker is far to long really boring to sit through i could go on on all day long about how bad the nostril picker is i really could one thing i can't quite work out is was all this intentional by the filmmakers the nostril picker is indeed a unique film unique in it's awfulness incompetence in the the case of the nostril picker i hope it remains unique too having said that it's still not the worst film i've ever seen but it comes close that's for sure definitely one to avoid
<START> riff randell is a wildly obsessed fan of the rock group the ramones and so are most of the students in the school but a new tyrant of a principal ms togar thinks rock 'n' roll is a bad influence on the students especially the music from the ramones so when riff finds out they're performing in town she skips class for a couple of days to get tickets for herself and her friends but when ms togar discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets while this is happening tom roberts is totally love struck over riff but riff's friend kate rambeau feels the same way about tom but riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer joe ramone and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her song br br fun fun fun yep that's right 'rock n roll high school' doesn't drift away from it main focusÂ a boisterously daggy romp it wasn't what i was expecting that's for sure everyone participating in this dandy project looks like they're having a great time and the relaxing nature of it shows on screen with the energy providing such a glowing spirit which makes it a priceless experience that's not to say i think its art and the plot is as pointless as can be but watching this passionately crazy ride that escalates into some good harmless high jinks i just couldn't wipe the grin off my face it's tacky very cheesy densely chaotic but damn it's funky dory br br this low budget b grade feature from producer roger corman and john dante who was co writer and plus he co directed some scenes when director allan arkush was hospitalised on the last day shoot is basically a glorious homage on the rocking 1950s flicks by sticking with the fruitful clichÃ©s and throwing into the stew the teenage rebellion tag because of the generation gap between them and the adults who always know best these features might not be particularly fresh but they do rack up some appeal because of the dynamically gusto treatment the film has just one thing on mind to go out on a bang and they manage to do that courtesy of 'the ramones' who play themselves really you could say its one big trendy video clip since it's all about the ramonesÂ well most of it anyway i see a lot flack towards the ramones' acting ability these are musicians not actors which means it's not about their acting here it's the music we're suppose to dig they're here to perform which they deliver in that front with some kick ass tracks that peppered the film to create a totally upbeat vibe especially their flamboyant concert performances the buzzing soundtrack also had some killer tunes from some other artists such as devo the velvet underground mc5 fleetwood mack eddie and the hot rods and alice cooper but these jumping tracks fitted in well with the carefree feel and even the score was worked in rather well especially in the scenes involving ms togar with the score grasping the right mood that surrounds her mind set the playful mood of the film is pretty much like a roller coaster ride with such a racy pace between the electrifying tunes and comical segments ranging from scattered slapstick routines to it's sometimes clever tongue in cheek dialogue thrown in for good measure is a variety of light and heavy gags which i found very pleasurable and it gave it such a wider range to express itself br br what else gave the film an added boost had to be the divine pj soles better known for her performance in halloween who gave such a bang up performance as the peachy riff randell other exemplary performances were dey young as the extremely cute kate rambeau vincent van patten as the gawky tom roberts and the go to man eaglebauer who's stupendously played by clint howard also some top drawer corman regulars pop up with great send up performances by mary woronov who's excellent as the demanding ms togar who's pushing her unfair reign on the students paul bartel as mr mcgree and a small support role from dick millar towards the end the enthusiastic acting is pretty campy but that goes down well with the material and there's a certain likability stemming from these characters but we totally despise ms togar and her hall monitor goons br br there's no beating around the bush here when i say 'rock 'n' roll high school' is an intoxicating hoot of a rad time
<START> this is quite a dull movie well shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and art house connotations all over it fails because the director takes no position stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates one of france's revered and regular working partner on films with depardieu i believe they made 7 together pialat fails to engage it seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good hearted husband around isabelle hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like i don't know i like his arms i like the way he makes love to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because i assume he loves her so he accepts and hope for what that she will one day wake up and come to her senses things like this are not answered in pialat's condescending docu drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that don't add up i know the answers do not add up but please take a stand jules et jim this is not the final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving
<START> br br i saw this on the sci fi channel it came on right after the first one for some reason this movie kept me interested i don't know why stop asking br br spoilers okay it was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie in the first movie he had a reason to kill people but in this sequal half of the killings attempted killings were basicly for no reason stanley killed the director due to creative differences he captured the co writer due to creative differences but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast no cast no movie he wanted it to look real when they died if this was supposed to be such a high budget movie use the special effects man of course like the first one the captured girl gets away and stanley ends up getting messed up and dissapears woooooow sarcasm this movie had potential and the saddest thing of all the really sad part i would watch a cabin by the lake 3 only because i like judd nelson and he's the only good part about this sequal
<START> when people ask me why do i like movies so much i usually respond have you seen the art gallery sequence in de palma's dressed to kill that scene alone pretty much represents everything i want to see in a film if i was a film director that would be the kind of thing i'd like to do pure cinema is one way of describing that sequence and it is truly amazing to see how director de palma's entire movie works at the same high artistic frequency of that scene it is a dream like movie clever as hell and with more zest and intelligence than a dozen films put together i think the movie raises an important point that will always be a topic of heated discussion could a movie rely solely on technique and still be considered an artistic success the film has no message to speak of acting is great but it is at the service of the style and the script is short on logic de palma's movie makes a really good case that style when handled properly can sustain a feature length film sure michael caine angie dickinson nancy allen and keith gordon give superlative performances but this is a director's movie all the way to the fadeout it is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the film medium i won't tell you what hitchcock movie the film pays homage to i don't want to spoil any surprises but i think de palma transcends the story's arc and he manages to create a film that pretty much summarizes his entire career not for the faint of heart
<START> there will be a time where kids will have grown up without ever seeing the one and only bugs bunny kiss technically another man on the lips there will be a time where it won't be duck or rabbit season there will be a time where the tazmanian devil will be dubbed politically incorrect br br but so help me now is not that time br br nobody really wants an 'extreme' version of our beloved loony characters whoever it is in marketing who comes up with corn nuts corn gone wrong and extreme doritos and evidently this festering turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or whatever doesn't mean they know jack about kids br br i think that they're doing a disservice to children depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows of all time this show disgusts me and it's not just the dated artwork or terrible dialogue they misuse good voice talent like phil lamarr michael clarke duncan candi milo and so many others it lacks style humor character development and most importantly heart br br the show like it's repackaged characters slam tasmanian rev runner ace bunny is but a shadow of it's former timeless and beautiful self
<START> a pleasant surprise i expected a further downgrade along the line the rock 9 con air 7 armaggeddon 4 especially for such an overhyped film perhaps that's the reason so few approved of this new type of bruckheimer fare clever dialogue instead of snappy one liners decent background motivation instead of shake n bake stereotypes and when the chase came you really thirsted for it fanboys expecting an armageddon rollercoaster stay away this is one for the more intelligent action fans it didn't even bother me jolie appeared so little
<START> i saw this movie during a tolkien themed interim class during my sophomore year of college i was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy everyone else was laughing but they weren't within constant eyesight br br let's get it out of the way the peter jackson 'lord of the rings' films do owe something to the bakshi film in jackson's version of the fellowship of the ring for instance the scene in which the black riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in bakshi's film shot by shot you could call this plagiarism or homage depending on your agenda br br i'm sure the similarities don't stop there i'm not going to do any research to find out what they are because that would imply i have some mote of respect for this film i'm sure others have outlined the similarities look around br br this movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor and many many people died in the accident i've decided to list what i can remember in a more or less chronological fashion if i've left out anything else that offended me it's because i'm completely overwhelmed confronted with a wealth of failure and at high points mediocrity br br due to heavy use of rotoscoping gandalf is no longer a gentle wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film br br saruman the white is sometimes referred to as 'aruman' during the film without explanation he wears purple and red for some mysterious reason br br sam is flat out hideous the portrayal of his friendship with frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying yes hobbits are small like children but they are not children br br merry and pippin are never introduced they simply appear during a scene change with a one sentence explanation the film is filled with sloppy editing like this br br frodo sam pippin and merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road one of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his back which was not visible before and begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into la la la s awful br br aragorn apparently is a native american dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic no pants complete with huge square pilgrim belt buckle he is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie oftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass br br the black riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil they limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace this is disturbing to be sure but not frightening br br the scene before the black riders attempt to cross the ford of bruinen in which they stare at frodo who is on the other side on horseback goes on forever during which time the riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and do nothing else the scene was probably intended to illustrate frodo's hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound it turns out to be more plodding than anything else br br gimli the dwarf is just as tall as legolas the elf he's a dwarf there is simply no excuse for that he also looks like a bastardized david the gnome it's a crude but accurate description br br boromir appears to have pilfered elmer fudd's golden viking armor from that bugs bunny opera episode he looks ridiculous br br despite the similarity to tolkien's illustration the balrog is howl inducing and the least threatening villain in the entire film it looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers and it's barely taller than gandalf purists may prefer this balrog but i'll take jackson's version any day br br the battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments i'm not asking for action packed scenes like those in jackson's film but they are supposed to be fighting br br treebeard makes a very short appearance and i was sorry he bothered to show up at all watch the film you'll see what i mean br br alright now for the good parts of the film br br some of the voice acting is pretty good it isn't that aragorn sounds bad he just looks kind of like the jolly green giant br br galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal like tom bombadil she seems immune to the ring's powers of temptation and her voice actress isn't horrible either br br boromir's death isn't as heart wrenching as in jackson's portrayal of the same scene but it's still appropriately dramatic and more true to his death in the book though i don't believe jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did br br as my professor pointed out between whispered threats the orcs mainly at helm's deep if i'm correct resemble the war ravaged corpses of soldiers a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what's being attempted br br while this isn't really a positive point about the film bakshi can't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie or so i've been told the project was on a tight budget and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher ups who i'm sure hadn't read the books br br let me be clear i respect bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude i simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product br br overall i cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of tolkien's classic trilogy even for laughs unless you've already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters places and events i'm sure somebody somewhere will pick a copy of this up in confusion if you do keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it
<START> note i couldn't force myself to actually write up a constructive review of prom night it just can't be done instead i went through what i thought about while watching the movie br br things that i thought about while watching prom night br br i'm so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place only for the main character to wake up right before she bites it of course when i say elaborate deaths i mean off screen throat slashes or stabs in the stomach didn't the whole it's just a dream thing get ruined by dallas speaking of which i wonder if a couple stabs in the gut will cause immediate death br br the film is only ten minutes into and i can already count the horror clichÃ©s on two hands not a good sign br br even after just meeting the protagonist's boyfriend i'm convinced he will die anybody want to place bets br br the killer in this movie is a teacher that is obsessed with the main character donna by the way does anybody think that donna is a horrible name for a main character in a horror film he spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds donna celebrating her high school prom while there is no accounting for taste i seriously wonder who would take all that time to stalk somebody as dull as donna br br high schools allow proms to take place at hotels and doesn't keep track of the students apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please i suppose if this plot point wasn't in place the movie would be 90 minutes of people being bored out of their mind and randomly biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom i suppose the trade off for their excitement is my utter boredom with everything i've already played count the pieces of chewed bubble gum under the seat and guess how much money i have in my wallet and i'm only in the 20 minute mark how else will i entertain myself br br note to self don't forget milk and bread on the way home br br dear screenwriter you've used up enough false scares to get through this movie and every other horror remake this year br br the 1980 version of this film wasn't that good but compared to this remake it was like citizen kane or at least the godfather it had jamie lee curtis in one of her many post halloween horror flicks and it did have a little twist at the end i miss jamie lee i wish she'd act more br br apparently at prom there isn't much dancing going on instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college i hear all these colleges being brought up by name and i can't help but wonder who these girls have to cheat off of on the entrance exam to get in br br the killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and wipes up his mess between scenes that's the only logical explanation for why he could stab somebody to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time somebody goes up to the hotel room there is no trace of a struggle on another side note this is a very lazy killer michael myers went hunting after his victims just saying br br it's official the entire audience in the theater is rooting on the killer what triggered it was it whenever donna went back up to her hotel room while sirens were going off ordering everybody to exit the building was it her constant dreams and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on reenacting her steps to a tee or was it brittany snow's unconvincing performance i'll have to say it was all of the above br br okay who had he dies off screen in the third act you win the pot br br finally the movie is over my friend turns to me and says donna wasn't too smart that's the understatement of the week kind of like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind or a week long power outage is a slight inconvenience br br i can't wait to get on rotten tomatoes and see if anybody gave this move a favoring review br br i can't recommend this i refuse to recommend this this is as lazy of a horror film as any and the only way to enjoy its cheese smelling plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers and unfortunately for theater patrons alcohol isn't served br br rating out of
<START> as a another reviewer states hanna's war is an outstanding film about an outstanding person hanna anniko senesh who would become the jewish joan of arc unfortunately i diverge in opinion not agreeing that miss detmers as the lead is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter in truth for me her performance is not held back by her beauty but makes it all the more stark in the terror of the sadistic brutality as a resistor she faces maruschka detmers performance is brave poignant heartfelt or understood and totally believable in other words for me in the zone from the opening credits if you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something they believe in and be impressively entertained give hanna's war with maruschka detmers a try my hat is off also to ellen burstyn as hanna's mother a much well known and famous actress who could have made effort to walk off with the film in that it is a team effort perhaps of two actress' but not an all about eve situation
<START> there are three movies with this animation style that i fondly remember from my youth this movie the last unicorn flight of dragons and the hobbit i own copies of both dragons and the hobbit both excellent and i hadn't seen the last unicorn in more than a decade that was until today and now i wish i hadn't what bothered me the most was the script it was incredibly choppy and often inane things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation we're not just talking about little things here either we're talking about key plot points the story itself isn't that great to begin with but it could have worked had the script been decent not even close on top of that the music was awful i know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a bowling ball this was one of those films that i was going to show to my kids some day but it just got cut i don't think i could ever sit through that crap fest again disappointed is putting it mildly
<START> a series of shorts spoofing dumb tv shows groove tube hits and misses a lot overall i do really like this movie unfortunately a couple of the segments are totally boring a few really great clips make up for this a predecessor to such classics like kentucky fried movie
<START> i am a huge fan of simon pegg and have watched plenty of his movies until now and none of them have ceased to make me laugh neither did how to lose friends and alienate people br br this movie is essentially about a man good as pissing people off however he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that might just make him famous but in the end he ends up doing them the culture of life br br the movie is well toned with humor romance good acting and also a bit of a lap dance its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends
