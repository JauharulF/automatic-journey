<START> farrah fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama where she plays marjorie a woman who manages to escape the clutches of a would be rapist well done to farrah for being a golden globe 'best actress' nominee br br when her rapist joe terrifically played by james russo comes into her home which she shares with her two roommates who are conveniently out marjorie has to play along with joe's frightening demands it does make for some disturbing and shocking images br br when her roommates come home they are astounded to say the least by marjorie's actions and a great performance by alfre woodard who desperately tries to convince marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police makes the film even more nail biting br br i do find diana scarwid quite irritating but when joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all it makes the film a very emotional piece of drama indeed br br overall extremities is a brilliantly thought out and well acted movie and i must have watched it hundreds of time by now well done to everybody involved
<START> this is a truly magnificent and heartwrenching film ripstein's locations are spectacular extremely detailed and well lit the dialogue is extraordinarily garcÃ­a mÃ¡rquez no doubt about it fernando lujÃ¡n and marisa paredes give us outstanding performances as the colonel and his wife br br you must see it
<START> this is the only film i've seen that is made by uwe boll i knew that he is probably the worst director ever who always makes films based on video games also that house of the dead is one of imdb bottom 100 but i still wanted to watch it because i'm a huge fan of the game and i wanted to see what doe's the film have that makes it so bad after watching it i do agree that it is crap the movie had no story in the first 15 20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about for a moment there i was wondering are the zombies brain dead or the girls are then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere started attacking people later a woman started shooting them i mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes is it supposed to be a comedy or horror or both before i knew it i fell asleep at the second half woke up during the end credits so i did not manage to watch all of it which is a good thing the film is a true insult to the classic game uwe boll please do not make any more films thank you
<START> as far as i can tell you in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors this film is currently available on dvd i found it only a few weeks ago br br it is on the value dvd label and i paid the grand total of 98 cents plus tax for it i found it at a 98 cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks now don't you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super duper swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had i thought so br br this film was indeed well worth 98 cents 99 cents i might start to argue with you but clearly worth 98 cents and remember that saying about getting what you pay for for slasher film mavens only
<START> routine suspense yarn about a sociopath dillon who gives his sperm to a clinic of human reproduction and starts to harrass the lives of the woman antony and his husband mancuso extremely predictable far fetched and with undecided tone all the way don't lose your time with this one make a baby instead
<START> mystery men has got to be the stupidest film i've ever seen but what a film i thought it was fabulous excellent and impressive it was funny well done and nice to see ridiculous super heroes for a change and being able to pull it off this was great i'll definitely watch it again
<START> i bought this movie because this was shah rukh khans debut and i also liked to see how would he do i must say he is excellent in his role divya bharathi is superb in this movie rishi does a wonderful job susham seth supported well alok nath was good in his role amrish and mohnish did their parts well too dalip also was good in his small role actors shine in a mediocre movie the direction is average the editing is poor the story is boring it tells us about ravi a famous pop singer he has a lot of female fans one of them is kaajal ravi and kaajal fall in love and get married ravi gets killed by his cousins kaajal becoems a widow to escape from ravis cousins they go to bombay she comes across raja she falls in love with him and gets married ravi returns the story is predictable the climax is predictable the first half bores it also drags a lot but it is saved by the actors and music the second half entertains the music is catchy with some nice songs the cinematography looks outdated in the first half but it looks unimaginative the song picturisations are dull except for sochenge tumhe pyar and one rain song the costumes are outdated any way watch this just for the actors and music rating 4 10
<START> remember the chain smoking channeler exposed on 60 minutes a few years ago this is her lots of folks reviewed this movie without checking the bona fides of the filmmakers the producers have been using phony word of mouth promotions very successfully without disclosing the financial and philosophical underpinnings for this piece of marketing tripe if you believe in channeling reincarnation new age dreck and day old baloney this film is for you if you want a discussion of quantum physics or reality look elsewhere the purpose of this movie is to convince you that ramtha isn't a wacko so you'll give her a bunch of your money if you can tiptoe through the ramtha website without howling in disbelief then maybe you'll think the bucks you dropped on this infomercial for insanity was well spent http rogerebert suntimes com apps pbcs dll section category answerman
<START> this movie captures the absurd essence of an overbearing american patriot actor one that believes his work and politics are as crucial to the american people as the opinions of the president himself alan bates captures this mindset perfectly as michael baytes and i will immortally remember bates as this character this is a movie for canadians and americans alike it is a valuable piece of cinema that which is able to take its audience through the magic of making a film and reveal just how easy it is for the producer and director to lose complete control to the will of the actors and innumerable outside forces wonderfully hollywood north does not suffer from the subject that it portrays peter o'brian directs with precision and complete control and commands both the serious 'behind the scenes' portion of the movie and the movie within the movie flight to bogota with clarity and insight if you are at all interested in the wit and strength of canadian cinema hollywood north is a great place to start
<START> i believe a lot of people down rated the movie not because of the lack of quality but it did not follow the standard hollywood formula some of the conflicts are not resolved the ending is just a little too real for others but the journey the rich characters and long list of supporters provide is both thought provoking and very entertaining even the cinematography is excellent given the urban setting the directing also is excellent and innovative br br this is a 10 in my book this movie will take you places the normal and expected hollywood script will not they took some risks and did a few things different i think it worked well i am purposely trying to avoid any direct references to the movie because seeing it for yourself is the best answer not accepting someone else's interpretation
<START> i have to admit that by moments i had to laugh at how bad that movie was but the laughs were too few and since this whole thing was in no way a parody it felt more like an insult to the viewer's intelligence the worst acting i have ever seen from any of these people
<START> i've read one comment which labeled this film trash and a waste br br of time i think this person got their political undies tugged a bit br br too much br br i just rented the new criterion dvd's of both yellow and blue br br these films although hardly great have at least become of br br historical interest as to the so called radical student br br political social movement of the late '60s br br i hadn't seen either picture and from their notorious reputation i br br was expecting some real porn there isn't any there is frontal br br nudity including the still verboten frontal male nudity automatic br br nc 17 the orwellian x in the u s but i wasn't expecting the films br br in your face democratic socialist message br br though it tends to the simplistic i thought it occassionally made br br its points well both films occassionally had me laughing out loud br br and the director's commentary made it clear there was plenty of br br parody in the film especially the supposedly pornographic sex br br scenes the first such scene is very realistic the lead couple is br br clumsy inept funny and endearing in their first copulation scene br br the second which caused the most complaints has faked br br cunnilingus and fellatio and the last is the end of an angry fight br br that is believable br br the extras include an informative introduction to the film an br br interview with the original american distributor and his attorney br br excerpts from trial testimony in the u s and a diary commentary br br by the director on some scenes br br this is the film that blue noses wouldn't let alone and led to the br br pivotal prurient interest with no social redeeming value standard br br that thankfully still stands br br those with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a must br br see
<START> manoj agrawal after the failure of pardesi babu 1998 returned with this film br br the film has govinda in 8 9 roles as his father mother grandfather sister and later on he also has disguises br br he in short is a useless detective send on a case by his friend to get proofs against his wife whose photos he looses at the airport while flirting with rani br br he disguises as a sardarji in the plane and again as a girl the funny part is how easily and in short time he does that br br then he disguises as a french singer and enters a tv to get proofs lol and then as a maharashtrian yes inside the tv itself br br the rest of the film has the same mistaken identities and ends on a predictable note there are some funny scenes like govinda being bashed by an african and also many other portions br br direction by manoj agrawal is okay music is okay br br amongst actors govinda again proves he is one of the most watchable actors he as usual is fantastic though he has done such roles before he fits in all the get ups and roles too well here again though the much hyped 6 7 roles don't actually fit in the film rani looks fat teams up well with govinda thatz it she is nothing great and kept doing such type of roles amongst rest nirmal pandey is as usual johny lever is too loud at times and funny in places in 1 role and irritates as the older tinnu anand is okay satish kaushik is hilarious paresh is okay tanaaz is okay
<START> ten years after the first movie james belushi one of the most gifted and over looked light comedic actors of the last twenty years returns as detective dooley for this movie br br if you are expecting more of the same from the first movie you will be disappointed but this is still a good movie realizing that all the dog vs man battle of wills scenarios had probably been used up in the first movie this one turns slightly more psychological in its approach as it concentrates on a criminal with a fixation with dooley's recently deceased wife after she rejected his book and blames dooley for her death br br the script may not be the best but the movie allows both belushi and christine tucci to show their good acting ability while still retaining enough of the light humour of the first movie to make it work and the chemistry between the two stars is there for all to see br br an easy light going movie which while maybe not worth a purchase unless you are a true fan of either the first movie or belushi definately worth a watch when it comes on tv br br
<START> i like many other bachchan fans having been eagerly awaiting the remake of sholay this movie was not it thank god they didn't let them use the name sholay in the movie title ram gopal's remake is not worthy of the title the camera work the locations the costumes the totally out of place dancing the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie i have ever seen you wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and ram gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast the only non paid actor the ant was the only resemblance to the first movie abishek's role was totally ridiculous did he need money to pay for the wedding to ash save your money your mind and your time don't bother with this movie or the dvd when that comes out
<START> dear god where do i begin this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand another is the cast it is great this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure i know some of you out there are probably thinking no way he has plenty better but no your wrong raptor island is a work of art i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever
<START> i love this show it's sure to be a winner jessica alba does a great job it's about time we have a kick ass girl who's not the cutesy type the entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots everything is layed out well and thought over to put it together must have taken a while because it wasn't someone in a hurry that just slapped something together it's a great show altogether
<START> there are two distinct ways to enjoy this snappily written seminal tv show the godfather to x files and buffy etc as a monster show it scared the hell out of me when i was a kid or as a well written acted gumshoe film noir it works on both levels the scariness may have been diluted over the years it was made in the mid 70s but i was pleasantly surprised upon rediscovering the show via dvd that i actually enjoy it more now for the latter reasons the late darren mcgavin is karl kolchak an eccentric tenacious rumpled newsman monster hunter who in pursuit of a story always finds a supernatural angle much to the pain of kolchak's over stressed put upon boss tony vincenzo played with tremendous world weariness by the also late great simon oakland you can practically feel the pain of his budding ulcers the interplay between these characters is crackling and witty much like star trek's spock and mccoy only more acidic over the course of two pilot tv movies and a one season series kolchack fought vampires robots werewolves witches zombies government conspiracies aliens and ancient legends sounds like the entire 9 yr run of the x files in one season and kolchak did it first and as for composer gil melle's cool partly whistled main title music well x files creator chris carter calls mike snow's very similar x files main title theme an 'homage ' both themes work well leave it at that and unlike many modern horror sci fi shows most of kolchak's monsters are shown in shadow and in quick cuts effectively and sometimes thankfully as some of them do not hold up to modern scrutiny but some still do modern horror shows take note less is more one of the few flaws of the show and it's a small one is the over use of sunny california locales passing for windy city chicago night gallery had the same issue unavoidable for a modest budget l a based show and some of the supporting characters seem to fall into what are now viewed as clichÃ©s the effeminate reporter ron updike always used for comic relief sweet old lady advice columnist emily but they all do have their moments to shine unlike many supporting tv characters since clichÃ© or not kolchak is a timeless show that serves as a template for many that followed and carl kolchak is one of the richest characters ever written for a horror genre tv show agent mulder's real dad and as a footnote i tried watching a few episodes of the new re imagining of the show it's an x files clone a copy of a copy and a bad one at that carl kolchak is now a model pretty angsty 30 something played dismally by a boring stuart townsend and giving him a scully type partner is also a lame idea it undermines kolchak as a lone don quixote crusader and kolchak and vincenzo getting along where's the tension the interplay that they chose to hang the kolchak name on this regurgitated bit o' crap is a prime example of how not to do a remake take a beloved cult series scrape off everything unique about it drain it of all character and color but keep the name need that cult cred and voilÃ  instant re hash it gets an 'f' in 're imaginings 101' this new version deserved the axe stick with the short lived but classic original it truly gets better with age
<START> a wonderfully quirky film with enough twists for a sack of pretzels parker posey plays fay grim as a sexy vulnerable loving mother who may or may not be what she seems the story is very tongue in cheek and the dialog skillfully understated hints of humor and intrigue neither of which overpower the characterization posey pulls off so well the supporting cast is stellar the downside this film needs your full attention almost to the point of stopping the film and taking notes posey has more sex appeal in her lifting of an eyebrow than most actresses have in their entire body she's worth your time even if you don't understand the denouement
<START> a good film and one i'll watch a number of times rich the previous commenter is right there is much more going on here than is clear from the title boards and i have to wonder how much has suffered in translation were there more in the original or was a native language audience expected to lip read more or since the screenplay was written by the author of the novel on which this was based was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar in short very worth a look but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 audience had to put into it br br the alpha video release touts the new organ score but the music is not matched to the story progression in any way sure it starts promisingly but degenerates into a repetitive phillip glass like monotony that reflects nothing of the action on the screen after listening for a while i turned off the sound and simply watched much better
