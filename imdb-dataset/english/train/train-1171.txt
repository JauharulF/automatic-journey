<START> this documentary is a proof of talent being used for mean purposes the fact that it is financed by the venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in the purpose of searching for the truth of what really happened those horrible days of april 2002 in venezuela something even we venezuelans don't know for sure br br there are ways of lying and the directors of this stuff lie both by omission and by knowledge br br the venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by foreign audiences and they take advantage of that for instance possible spoilers they show pro chÃ¡vez demonstrators shooting at an empty street what the hell they did that for in a way of saying they didn't kill anyone but didn't bother showing the images we all saw here of opposition demonstrators and a journalist falling dead or injured at the other side of that empty street they can't explain why the chopper of the political police was the only one authorised to fly over caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers that were all over the roofs of the buildings nearby the presidential palace something that would exhibit how inefficient would be the security measures to guard the president a few days after the coup the chief of the military guard in charge was asked at the national assembly our congress why didn't they act against the snipers and he said 'cause they weren't there to act against the president isn't that a confession br br there is so much more the fact that the highest rank military announced that chÃ¡vez had resigned and 2 days later he said he had lied because that's politics and nowadays is the minister of internal affairs of chÃ¡vez' administration br br it would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this documentary made with the intention of selling the world an image of the good old hugo chÃ¡vez who rules for the poor and the bad rich opposition that wants him out at all costs when the truth is that 60 70 of people rejects his government and that percentage includes the poor br br i hope those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version that is being made by a group of venezuelan people showing no less than 30 lies br br nazi propaganda has returned
<START> i seriously can't believe tim burton and timur bekmambetov two people i love signed on to produce this crap tim burton is a brilliant director but to be honest i've been losing interest in him for a while since his last few movies were either remakes or adaptations he did produce the brilliant nightmare before christmas which is one i've watched multiple times and directed movies like beetlejuice and sleepy hollow which are awesome films bekmambetov directed 3 films that i love night watch day watch and wanted i've only seen those three of his but they prove he's an awesome director br br those two people producing one of the many reasons i was excited to see 9 so today i went to go see it at the theatre i was so excited to finally have seen it i had waited 7 months for the movie to come out br br this movie is the first time i've walked out of a tim burton related movie and said i enjoyed almost none of that i felt heartbroken to even have felt that way i mean with him and bekmambetov at the production helm you'd have expected this movie to be a good watch right now i still can't get over how let down i was by this movie i hadn't even heard of the original short film before seeing it but now i can successfully say that this movie should have remained a short movie hell neil blomkamp made an awesome full length remake of alive in joburg entitled district 9 what was so hard to get right about 9 i really wanted to think this movie was awesome i really did but no it failed on so many levels br br the plot was extremely confusing and disjointed i had no idea what was going on let alone what it was about basically it's about a bunch of rag doll robots trying to save the earth well ok that's what i got from it but the writing here is extremely poor the whole film jumps around like a 6 year old with a d d telling a story there's this big giant clanky monster robot that 9 awakens causing destruction and stuff that's the main villain however what else is wrong with this movie is that everything comes out of nowhere there were too many monster robots most of which have no logical explanation behind them they have 0 development whatsoever i mean that flying pterodactyl like monster just rips out of nowhere we have no idea where it comes out of and acker just expects us to know what it is what was even more retarded was that snake like creature with the strobing eyes that hypnotize i dare you to give that description to someone else out loud and expect them not to laugh all of the 3 people i told about it burst out laughing oh and it wraps victims up and sews them inside it i'm not kidding br br the twist in act iii is the most retarded aspect of the whole movie so basically 9 goes back to the room he woke up in finds this box with a hologram from the scientist in it for 9 and he tells him that the big scary machine robot was designed to bring robot life to earth but then evil humans use it for war and it was supposed to help protect the earth but then the scientist gave his life to 9 so that it could help protect the world with it and he only mentions giving his life to 9 but what about the other robots who gave their lives to them this is the perfect example of poor rushed writing there's only one of the life taking device thingy that exists so how did the other 8 get life given to them the characters are not likable at all either they risk their lives for no reason at all the only good character is 7 6 annoyed me with his go back to the source ramblings 1 is an overpowering idiot 2 we don't know anything about 5 kept annoying me with his are you sure or can i stay here instead questions and that ending ugh i'm glad i'm not the only one who thinks that the ending was a huge wtf moment br br there's nothing redeeming about this turd except for its beautiful animation everything looks realistic and beautiful i love the gloomy and depressing look of everything however beauty can't save a good movie br br while it's true that this movie is very pretty looking pretty is as pretty does and 9 does squat i'm sure burton fans will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie without a doubt in fact with his and bekmambetov's names being thrown around the promos people will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie i know i may be making a big deal out of nothing but watching this movie made me realize how much i hate movies with unlikeable characters nonexistent plot and just pure style over content and this movie is one of those movies
<START> i get it the diehl character is s'posed to be a microcosm of america itself seeing arab terrorists under every rock only to find out at the end that it's his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices good will to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops sorry wim you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason polemics are your weak point and they weaken this a well made amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters dialog and plotting better luck on your next flick another thing that yanked my crank was the belabored point of the homeless section of la being there for reasons of hunger these people don't get enough to eat truly these folks aren't eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger an emotional hunger a mental hunger they need self respect self worth dignity which you can't give a man yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available less the center for hunger in america i would say it's more the center for alcoholism drug abuse mental suffering and economic devastation dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is band aiding a more profoundly systematic societal and age old human problem of homelessness bill diehl was good though and michelle williams was cute as the young yet cliched old soul
<START> some of my favorite laurel and hardy films have very very little plot instead they give them a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious films such as help mates and busy bodies are among the funniest as you see the boys working or cleaning house here in dirty work most of the film is akin to these other two films stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the film trying quite unsuccessfully to clean a crazy professor's chimney seeing ollie fall through the chimney the boys making the house a total mess and the insane behaviors of stanley all work together to make a very pleasing film br br however in an odd twist there is also a really weird subplot that begins and ends the movie it seems that the professor is truly a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger late in the film you see him make a duck into a duckling and even a duckling into an egg given that he then leaves the boys alone in the room is it any surprise what happens next while this subplot was unnecessary it worked well enough what worked exceptionally well was the middle portion give the boys nothing exciting to do and you'll be amazed at the hilarious results one of the team's better films and it almost earns a 9
<START> we all knew even before it aired the ron moore mini series is no battlestar galactica that's fine it just means it must stand on its own it can't lean on battlestar galactica if it's any good it's good on it's own merits and ron moore has something to be proud of if reports are true this is what moore wanted however if his mini series rots he has shamed all the excellent actors that performed on screen not to mention the myriad off screen personnel and this is what he's done br br yes this mini series is no remake i wouldn't even call it a re imagining it's a new production inspired by battlestar galactica it does not take place in the galactica universe with the same places and jargon and technology it doesn't tell of the galactica's search for the thirteenth tribe nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that underpinned galactica ron moore's mini series is a space opera action flick with a ceremonial nod to battlestar galactica br br maybe i should say just another space opera action flick because as plots go his has little that's original or even interesting i could relay the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning but i won't inflict that on you i'll just hit the most important point ready now here it is just watch the trailer it will tell you everything there is in the story br br yes creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man i guess they forgot azimov's rules again they look like humans so there's the whole aliens among us thing at least there's no time travel oh and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence the end result was that when moore did draw from galactica that ceremonial nod it came off more corny than respectful i mean couldn't he even think up anything of his own br br from the first few minutes i wanted to watch something else i didn't care about any of moore's characters since i couldn't identify with any of them this fact hit me in the face when the cylons began their attack armageddon on a planetary scale and i didn't give a damn how depressing br br moore's heroes when faced with an insurmountable obstacle instead of overcoming it rather tucked tail and saved their own butts after all it was the only way to save humanity yadda yadda yadda they took the safe way out rather than risking their own lives to defend others at least disgust is not apathy br br but in the end the ron moore mini series was just activity without purpose a movie on a treadmill forever running yet going nowhere and i just wanted it to be over and by the time it was over my life force had been sucked from me against my own will i was turning into a mindless soulless zombie probably of the type to which this mini series would appeal i needed to replenish myself i needed to and i swear this is true i needed to watch an episode of babylon 5 two episodes in fact and i felt much better and happier
<START> pushing daisies truly is a landmark in television as an art form everything seems to pay homage to amelie and tim burton but so what in a world where fresh ideas are distinctly rare this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether its fresh or not it is just brilliant br br i have been captivated from the start the intelligent writing the directing to the backdrops and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since the shield and the wire ok not exactly good comparisons but the beauty of pushing daisies is that it has no comparisons on television br br truly addictive and an absolute pleasure perhaps like one of the piemakers pies that get mentioned in such tantalising ways
<START> there is so much that is wrong with this film but to sum it up terrible acting so bad it must have been on purpose poor script they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story ridiculously bad ending in some cases the ending manages to save the film not in this case if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for this is the worst film i have seen in a long time it was complete torture sitting through this film i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance so do yourself a favor watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture
<START> all of david prior's movies are terrible on all counts bad writing bad acting bad cinematography no budget the director's brother is usually cast as the male lead but they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity the plot of almost every david prior film as i like to refer to them is basically the same manly all american commandos team up to blow up communist baddies but unlike other cold war era garbage such as red dawn prior's movies are actually funny because of their over the top premises and acting the best part of jungle assault is the scene in which becker or was is the other dude is being summoned by general mitchell for a top secret mission in south america the funniest line in the movie is then delivered something to the effect of this is my roommate i trained him well what you trained your roommate and apparently this is going to be their solution to avoiding eviction br br if you can find these gems on video used anywhere buy them they are all funny and even funnier after a few beers watch them with a group of your friends for a true mst3k style experience so far my friends and i have managed to get a hold of night wars and aerobicide aka killer workout but the one i recommend the most over them all is final sanction with the freakish looking robert z'dar
<START> for romance's sake as a married man the following two films are recommended br br 1 brief encounter by david lean 1945 uk br br well when a woman goes to a railway station something may happen and it happened how she longed to be there in a little tavern waiting for the man of her dreams but she was married the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman br br 2 xiao cheng zhi chun by fei mu 1948 china br br well when a woman goes to the market to buy fish grocery and medicine passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town there is much to think about about the melancholy of her life her sick husband in self pity and lack of future just when a jubilant young doctor arrived something happened the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing woman br br in both movies from great directors of uk and china the passion vs restraint was so intense yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any physical contacts that leaves you with a great after taste sniffing it intensely without biting it
<START> what made me track this movie down was the viewing vampyres i thought i have to get the other movies this guy larroz has made i was sorry i tracked this down it is a weak attempt at an occult satanic type movie laden with sex and only sex with ugly actors and actresses this is an excuse for sleaze the only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere avoid this one too much hype surrounds it not worth the effort of finding it this refers to the welcome to the grind house edition i hope he has some other movies which lives up to vampyres oh and the goat scene was very boring i understand that this is what carries the hype
<START> i have to say i am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie i found it to be absolutely idiotic the mother gets visions when she touches certain things or people and one thing she touched twice made her vision continue just seemed so ridiculous deedee pfieffer's performance was awful i thought she was very irritating the girl who played lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with br br i usually love lmn and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me
<START> this movie was bad to say the least the plethora of superb cars are disgraced to have have been showcased in this lame movie it starts off with a race from l a to las vegas to be completed in 1hr 45min in a ferrari f430 i did that in 1hr 50min in a tiny 4cylinder 140hp 1993 honda accord seriously this movie does not do justice to these cars obviously these writers are just that and probably drive under the speed limit with their hands 10 2 o'clock i remember seeing on the news how eddie griffin crashed a 1 5 million dollar ferrari enzo going 30 40mph youtube com watch v cnvrmzx2kms br br and the director andy cheng is the biggest sellout he brings shame to his own race i wonder just how many people he orally pleased just to break into hollywood he partook in a movie that portrays asian americans in such a negative and false way asian women cheap money grubbing whores asian men losing compulsive gamblers thugs that get beat all the time what the heck is all the fear about asians why the need to always portray them in such a negative connotation i am so sick of the way hollywood always portrays asians in such a negative and false pretext
<START> at first i was convinced that this was a made for tv movie that wasn't worthy of primetime but after a few minutes of dumb struck awe i realized that there was at least comic value in the over the top stunts and c movie acting this movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and i hadn't laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face it was like a less funny spy version of the big hit i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd with even worse acting we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena and not jim after all of the hugging and high fives a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier
<START> i usually steer clear of tv movies because of the many ways you know that it's tv movies five seconds into the picture this one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy well crafted mood that is established from the very start while the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story even if claiming to be set in california the movie was largely shot around a stormy vancouver b c the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement olmos' excellent acting
<START> the fourth tremors feature goes back in time to the year 1889 the legend begins in the small city of perfection which was then rejection nevada as the story begins seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly graboids some of the characters in the present day tremors films have ancestors both figurative and literal in the past most obvious is the ever returning michael gross as hiram gummer unlike his descendant mr gross is inept with firearms so he hires gunslinger billy drago as black hand kelly to shoot 'em up some dirt dragons br br this one takes some getting used to as it takes place in the distant past it's like a western with miniature versions of the original film's monster graboids these tamer dirt dragons are nowhere near as terrorizing as their tremors 1990 counterparts consequently in this film the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground which would not have happened in the original movie and it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly when gross temporarily decides to leave town why so helpless why didn't brent roam as juan pedilla immediately rally the people to fight without gross disappointing br br tremors 4 the legend begins 2004 s s wilson michael gross brent roam billy drago
<START> could this be by the same director as don't look now or bad timing poorly br br acted clunkily edited you only have to compare the various accident scenes in this with similar ones in don't look now to see how much roeg has lost his br br touch br br even the generally reliable teresa russell looking a bit chunky these days i'm afraid to report cannot save this one the plot is pure pseudo religious hokum the acting is wooden and roeg's attempts at his trademark dislocation of time are pitiful br br avoid this one like the plague
<START> small college town coed od's why do we care acting sheriff investigates the incident why do we care the interviews show us the comatose subject kirshner as different as the opinions of the subjects being interviewed why do we care result a mess of flashbacks in this mess of a movie featuring a handful of one hit wonders and b flick divas which begs the question why do we care
<START> some here have commented that this is the worst elvis movie ever made well they are only partly right for me this is the worst movie ever made period i have never seen anything so basely crude and insulting and vile and against human nature as this film a true embarrassment to the motion picture industry this isn't even so bad its good there is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of elvis' other bad movies like clambake this one is so rotten to sit through its painful pure garbage native americans should sue for their poor clichÃ©d and stereotypical treatment here actually perhaps all human beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole 0 stars seriously grade f
<START> documentary starts in 1986 in nyc where black and hispanic drag queens hold balls that's where they dress up however they like strut their stuff in front of an audience and are voted on we get to know many of the members and see how they all hold together and support each other as one man says to another you have three strikes against you you're black gay and a drag queen these are people who sadly are not accepted in society only at the balls there they can be whoever and whatever they want and be accepted then the film cuts to three years later 1989 and you see how things have changed tragically for some br br sounds depressing but it's not most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations they're well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor just as they should we find out they all live in houses run by various mothers and all help each other out the sense of community in this film is fascinating br br when this film came out in 1990 it was controversial and a big hit it won best documentary awards at numerous festivals but was never even nominated for an academy award their reason was black and hispanic drag queens are not academy material fascinating isn't it homophobia and racism all together br br seen today it's still a great film and a period piece it just isn't like that anymore the ny they show no longer exists the balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here also drag has become more accepted in society for better or worse and i've heard the houses are gone too that's kind of sad i would like to know where these characters are now i know two died of aids but i have no idea about the others and what did happen to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown br br still it a one of a kind documentary fascinating funny and riveting a must see all the way a definite 10 where's the dvd
<START> this movie was highly entertaining the soundtrack bian adams is simply beautiful and inspiring even more impressive is brian adams doing all the songs in french as well the score is also uplifting and dramatic br br the movie is made from a mix of traditional animation combined with computer generated images the result is truly stunning i watch this film at least once a week with my kids and we never tire of it the story is compelling and well narrated br br i don't understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7 definately a keeper in my household
