<START> mary lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957 br br well the movie mainly takes place in 1986 the movie falls into the 80's trap of weird stupid special effects including some weird demented looking rocking horse br br anyway mary lou's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person's body whether or not she succeeds you'll have to watch to find out br br anyway the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters this also isn't really a sequel the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school it has the avg horror flick fall backs gore pointless nudity knocks against the catholic church basic stuff boring movie br br the acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10 you can waste your time doing something else
<START> may seem like an overstatement but it is not br br what is so hard to comprehend is why didn't they make more musical shorts like this wasn't the beauty of it totally apparent to everybody involved i guess not so many shorts were made for commercial reasons only and with some luck there may be some artistic value in there this is one exception the only one where it seems they were the director had a vision and clearly could appreciate the music as art why didn't anybody ever think to shoot lester or charlie parker on a live date crazy man br br a pity there were no sequels if you've seen anything of similar quality please share it
<START> i was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of tigerland it was a liberal's fantasy of how the military should be the dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things colin farrell's character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers br br i kept thinking hey there's a reason why boot camp is tough it's supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit there's no room for cocky attitudes and men who won't follow orders i was rooting for bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers i would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with people's feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit br br br br
<START> ok not bad movie making if it were from an original script but it is not br br which part of in this story there are no women except for foulata and gagoola introduction by haggard did the producers directors and writers not understand i mean it is pretty plain english i understood it at age 10 the beauty of ksm is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds the colonial africa the unforgiving desert and kukuanaland a hidden and isolated kingdom that should be more than enough for even the most mediocre of producers to work with but nooo they have to throw romance into it pathetic suggestion to all you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book give it up until a peter jackson wannabe comes along and does it right you may as well keep re reading the tome btw there is a sequel book actually a pre quel called allan's wife it gives background to the story of quatermain it is a bit creepy but good
<START> i rank this the best of the zorro chapterplays the exciting musical score adds punch to an exciting screen play there is an excellent supporting cast and mystery villain that will keep you guessing until the final chapter reed hadley does a fine job as don diego and his alter ego zorro last but certainly not least is the great directing team of whitney and english
<START> one of the worst movies i've ever seen acting was terrible both for the kids and the adults most to all characters showed no little or not enough emotion the lighting was terrible and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot in the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed there's 4 shots the sheriff and dad in the evening on their boat jillian and molly in the evening swimming the rest of the kids in the daytime when it's supposed to in the evening at the river bank and the doctor beatrice and simonton at night but not in the evening getting off their boat the best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff cappy although there's a slip of character when the pulse detector whatever that thing is when people die it beeps shows cappy has died he still moves while it can still be heard beeping and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually then it shows the pulse again and then he finally dies i guess it's not going to be perfect since it's an independent movie but it still could be better not worth watching honestly even for kids might as well watch something good like the lion king or toy story if you're going to see anything you'll remember
<START> i'm not at all picky about horror movies and i'm willing to watch pretty much any of them that doesn't mean that i'm willing to re watch many of them or that i won't have criticism for them this movie is creepy and is very well done in fact i think this movie would make an excellent double bill with session 9 br br i should specify before i get to my comments that i watched this alone i started watching it before going to bed and got about 15 minutes in before i realized that it was too effective so i saved the rest of it for the morning even while watching it in broad daylight it was still creepy however i can't vouch for how effective it would be when watching in a larger group br br after the death of their daughter a couple move to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death let me make note of this death this is one of the rare movies that doesn't shy away from the death of a child this is much more important as it both sets the tone as well as explains much of the acting that permeates the movie br br the couple is not doing well the wife has distanced herself from the relationship and the husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back while some of the comments have complained about their acting one specified that they act more like a father and daughter than husband and wife and that's legitimate he's trying to give her more direction it's a role that men sometimes take on br br there are a variety of scares in the film and most are fairly non violent though grotesque in some ways the story itself feels very straightforward for most of the film and takes an odd turn near the end while the turn is not absurd it is certainly not what you expected from the way things had been progressing br br moody atmospheric and very well done for something that appears to have been shot on video
<START> ever since i remember i have loved airplanes and flying i am now in college with a private pilot's license and looking to become a commercial i could never remember why i was so obsessed with the subject until i came across my old tail spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me this was it my parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show i would watch as a kid i had the theme memorized as i grew up and i can still re cite it today it is absolutely amazing and i plan on buying the dvd's soon it really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless i cannot get enough of this show
<START> if my expectations weren't exceeded they were certainly met nancy drew works both as a mystery and a comedy it pays homage to the books it was based on and spoofs them at the same time the movie starts with a close up on a book shelf and an animated credit sequence resembling illustrations from the books it then begins lampooning the books immediately writer director andrew fleming seems to realize the idea of a teenage girl regularly breaking up crime rings in a small town is ridiculous so he doesn't treat the idea religiously he pokes fun at nancy drew's ability to do anything such as ace every class in school know which baked treat is perfect for converting any enemy to her side make a bird house with twelve flying buttresses and even perform an emergency tracheotomy at a party nancy'd always be in perfect style if she were living in the wholesome 1950's instead of present day l a and she carries around a sleuth kit complete with fingerprinting dust flashlight compass and magnifying glass preposterous of course but i seem to remember the hardy boys' access at any given moment to csi equipment being a little too convenient as well and if the perky pipsqueak private eye is a little younger than her literary counterpart it's just more comedic exaggeration on the movie's part br br the mystery of the movie is handled more seriously nancy and her lawyer father move from their small town to los angeles where nancy digs into a cold case involving the murder of a hollywood movie star who lived in her new house decades ago nancy searches for clues in some pretty practical ways such as surfing websites like google and this one and watching old videotapes of the victim's movies when she does something more out of the ordinary you have to admire the girl's resourcefulness emma roberts an undeniably cute kid plays the pint sized amateur sleuth beautifully she makes the too perfect girl completely lovable if not completely realistic tate donovan is also great as the too perfect girl's father carson drew he's an ideal father figure without being unrealistically perfect and he shows reasonable concern for his daughter as she gets into danger less likable is max thierot's take on ned nickerson nancy's boyfriend i much preferred george o'hanlon jr 's portrayal in the 1970's tv series starring pamela sue martin as nancy drew in which ned was a gawky awkward kid with a little crush on nancy the character of corky josh flitty a twelve year old with a crush on nancy is much less annoying than max thierot's ned amy bruckner and kay panabaker seem appropriately cast as nancy's gal pals bess and george but they only make brief cameos at the beginning of the film br br speaking of cameos chris kattan snl eddie jemison ocean's 13 and bruce willis all make surprise guest appearances which just proves you never can guess which movie bruce willis will pop up in next br br the movie does fail to live up to some potential it's mentioned early on that the drews' new house is heavily booby trapped but nancy and her father are done with tripping over booby traps a few minutes after that also nancy describes the cold case she's about to investigate as a murder taking place at an extravagant party which should yield plenty of potential murderers but she only encounter a handful of suspects and while there's some moments of real suspense during nancy's adventures the solution to the case comes out of nowhere and in the end all possible plot threads are tied up too conveniently and who cares who done it ralph sall's score adds to the movie's suspense but the contemporary teenybopper songs woven into the soundtrack are lame still i really enjoyed this film and while the movie is aimed primarily at tween girls people of any age and gender can enjoy it
<START> all good movies inspire some direct to video copycat flick i was afraid that gladiator wasn't really that good a film because i hadn't seen any movie that had anything remotely resembling anything roman on the new releases shelf for months then i spotted full moon's latest offering demonicus i'm a fan of full moon's puppetmaster series and blood dolls but had never seen one of their non killer puppet films anyway br br demonicus chronicles what happens to a group of campers in the mountains of the alps one of the campers james finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts and feels impelled to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it on he becomes possessed and as the demonic gladiator tyrannus is impelled to kill his friends to revive the corpse who is the real tyrannus br br granted like many full moon films this has little or no budget at times the editing and direction was so amateurish i'd swear i was watching the blair witch project the attempts at chopping off of limbs and heads reminds me of a monty python skit the weapons although apparently real look really plastic y it literally looks like this was filmed by a group of friends with a digital camcorder on a weekend granted there's nothing wrong with such film making just don't rent this expecting a technical masterpiece it looks like there were attempts at research for the script too because even though tyrannus really doesn't act much like a gladiator until the end at least he speaks latin br br all trashing aside i actually enjoyed this film not as much as a killer puppet film perhaps but full moon still delivers the only thing that disappointed me was there was no full moon videozone at the end
<START> but sadly due to rights issues that almost certainly will never happen transcripts of joe bob's commentary on the sub b movies he screened are available on the internet but they don't quite capture his twang inflected delivery which was a real hoot nowadays joe bob real name john bloom is confined to doing the supplemental features of such classics as i spit on your grave featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film of all time and jason x one of the most reviled friday the 13th sequels of all time the series was never the same once it left paramount all i could think when they canceled it was damn where else am i going to get my fill of flesh ripping blonde jokes and horror trivia every saturday night does this mean i have to get a life now sadly it does but there'll always be a place in my horror hungry heart for monstervision long live the drive in
<START> much underrated camp movie on the level of cobra woman etc photographic stills resemble rembrandt prints sometimes subtle dialog and hidden literate touches found throughout
<START> 1st watched 12 26 2008 dir eugene levy corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was re written by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers but this one by charles shyer nancy meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts the story is about a couple of down and out traveling americans played by richard lewis and sean young who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund's return upon trying to return it they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the lady's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money they freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder the other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a monte carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story the other cast members include character actors john candy james belushi cybill shepherd george hamilton and others after the police find out about the death they start questioning the main characters and of course they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened none of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the belushi shepherd couple this isn't a horrible movie it just isn't that good there are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile try it maybe you'll like it probably you won't
<START> tim krabbe is the praised author of 'het gouden ei' a novel that was put on the screen twice 'spoorloos' and 'the vanishing' one of the dutch writer's more recent works is 'de grot' a psychological thriller about two totally different men egon and axel who meet at a youth camp and surprising enough become friends for dear life egon is a quiet somewhat dull person who spends his time studying and writing geography books axel on the other hand is a charismatic 'party animal' a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday's concern is to get a woman into his bedroom from the moment they meet axel has a strong influence on egon while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything such as reading thick books like egon ultimately egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country br br after having read the book last year i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it in my opinion the book suffers especially from the complex structure while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented chronologically so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode because of this the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a character's background to really care for him or her another complaint was the fact that the main characters egon and axel are a little stereotypical egon is 'the' dull intellectual while axel is his exact opposite in real life such one dimensional people rarely exist in books and films they always seem to be there taking away a lot of credibility br br despite all this the film was a pleasant surprise being much better than the book the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography humour and acting fedja van huet egon is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting which is in my opinion the highest an actor can achieve the drawbacks of the film however are the same as the book's mainly because the characters are one dimensional they are so predictable that it becomes annoying guess who wrote the script indeed krabbe himself it is obvious that this talented director that's what the movie makes clear anyway is hampered by a deficient screenplay perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book br br 7 10
<START> i gave it a 10 since everyone else seemed to like it and it would have been churlish not to the reason i'm troubling you is to add a personal observation on castle's work br br i've seen homicidal and the tingler the version with the clever colour sequence where everything except the blood is in black and white a few times and the house on haunted hill many times br br even i am not old enough to have seen them when castle was up to his showman tricks thus i can appreciate them for their own merit and while most pass him off as second rate schlocky hammy etc i believe they do him a disservice br br the end sequence of homicidal is genuinely shocking and works today and the premise of the tingler while silly was highly original br br but the house on haunted hill was a triumph having used that frank lloyd wright house as its exterior the great vincent price and a solid cast plus a good score and production values when i first saw it at a packed late night showing in the late sixties it produced an audience reaction i'd not seen before and have not seen since br br it was the bit where the heroine is alone in the basement if you've not seen the film stop reading now and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall br br with no telegraphing of what is coming the camera slowly pulls back forcing the audience to switch their gaze to i'm saying no more my spoiler declaration above only covers this movie br br the point is i believe this ploy was deliberate not accidental and when it happened the whole audience screamed including most of the men it took the audience about ten minutes to calm down br br now that is superior film making a flamboyant showman he might have been but house and the other two films i've mentioned were good movies castle may not have been a hitchcock but he was no ed wood either br br it's easy to concentrate on someone's quirks and forget to examine their talent so i hope this documentary acknowledged that i look forward to seeing it
<START> zero day leads you to think even re think why two boys young men would do what they did commit mutual suicide via slaughtering their classmates it captures what must be beyond a bizarre mode of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from common civility in order to define their own mutual world via coupled destruction br br it is not a perfect movie but given what money time the filmmaker and actors had it is a remarkable product in terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicide murderers it is better than 'elephant' in terms of being a film that gets under our 'rationalistic' skin it is a far far better film than almost anything you are likely to see br br flawed but honest with a terrible honesty
<START> presenting lily mars may have provided judy garland with one of the easier roles she had while at mgm because lily mars is definitely a character she could identify with a young girl with talent enough for ten she knows she has what it takes to make it in the theater no matter how much producer van heflin from her home town discourages her br br i really liked judy in this one as the girl determined to make it in the theater because it is judy garland with the talent of judy garland you in the audience know she has the right stuff even if it takes van heflin nearly the whole movie to be convinced br br both judy and heflin hail from the same small town heflin's dad was the town doctor who delivered her and heflin while he may have moved away and become a big producer on broadway their respective moms fay bainter and spring byington have kept in touch that's her entrÃ©e but heflin's constantly barraged with stagestruck kids but never anyone quite like lily mars br br no real big song hits came out of presenting lily mars for garland though she sings all her numbers the best in the film is a revival of that gaslight era chestnut every little movement has a meaning all its own judy sings it with connie gilchrist playing the cleaning lady in a broadway theater where heflin's show is being produced gilchrist was a star back in the days of the floradora girls and she and judy deliver the song in grand style with connie it's the best scene in the film as gilchrist encourages judy to keep at it composer karl hoschna had died a long time ago but lyricist otto harbach was still alive and i'm betting he liked what he heard br br european musical star marta eggerth is in presenting lily mars as the show's star who's at first bemused then angry and finally understanding of garland and heflin she did a couple of films with mgm and then went back to europe for more work on the continent i'm betting mgm didn't quite know what to do with her and her thick hungarian accent though louis b mayer never met a soprano he didn't like br br van heflin does well as the patient producer who puts up with a lot from garland and eggerth heflin was just coming off his oscar for johnny eager the previous year and he and garland wouldn't appear to be an ideal screen team but they're not bad together br br presenting lily mars is a fine showcase for the talents of judy garland and she didn't have to share the screen in another backstage film with mickey rooney
<START> br br entrails of a virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively applying whatever meaning he wishes to its inexplicable excesses of sex and violence if this was an intentional characteristic of the film it would be a work of postmodern brilliance but of course it isn't br br without getting too much into plot summary let's take a quick walking tour of the events at a secluded cabin an orgy is in progress which includes topless wrestling and diaper p ing a vanload of latecomers joins the orgy in progress but they have unwittingly been followed by a monster i like to call the muddy ninja this monster precedes to slay orgy participants one by one except the proverbial virgin if you don't count oral sex who receives his seed and consequently becomes so passionate with desire that she masturbates with someone's severed hand br br finally she has her guts pulled out and then there's a scene which seems to imply that she's pregnant with a baby muddy ninja got all that if you're going to rent this movie it's best if you don't speak japanese and don't have any subtitles in a season populated by boring hollywood flicks putting this in your vcr might be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy it will certainly be something different
<START> there were some scary scenes which i've always liked more than straight out gore but otherwise this movie was rather weak there were too many questions left unanswered and when they tried to explain anything in the movie it was still rather unclear after watching this movie i still seemed lost in a lot of ways it sort of reminded me of silent hill a few years back that movie was also unsatisfying but still better than this because it did try to work and the story did actually make sense this one not so much br br the acting for the most part in the abandoned was decent but the movie dragged on an on and never really gave any type of satisfying conclusion like i said above there were some creepy scenes but otherwise this movie was a mess sorry i can't recommend it
<START> fragglerock is excellent in the way that schindler's list was excellent a great watch for children and adults of all genders big noses can be seen as hinting towards phallic symbols in the same way that h r puff n stuff had hinted towards marijuana smoking your kids will love this movie i enjoyed it very much as a child my father showed me this movie as a child he enjoyed it as well and pointed out that the exaggerated noses were phallic symbols although at the time i had no clue about what those were the movie is comedy and adventure the storyline is wacky and cheerful i and you shall enjoy this together
