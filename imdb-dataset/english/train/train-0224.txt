<START> this movie should be called plan 9 from joseph smith i think its weirdness is underappreciated the playwright seems to have read paul ehrlich's the population bomb 1968 and crafted a musical response made especially for mormons the whole point of the play is that having as many children as you can is part of heavenly father's god's plan and anything that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad get it br br this version was filmed in 1989 which is confusing it's utah so it looks and feels like 1983 the play was actually written in 1973 and of course the theology is part 1840's part battlestar galactica some of the action takes place on earth and some in the pre existence an aimless romper room where annoying kids wait to get their bodies so they can come down try not to slam the door on the missionaries losing their shot at celestial glory br br it is as stagey as they come but don't let the poor theatrics spoil your appreciation for this demented mormon universe where the 'cool kids' are all into population control presumably counseling their parents not to have any more children having big families was at the time the play was written the cultural norm in the lds community and more importantly considered part of god's plan the church has since done a 180 and have made family planning a choice of the parents and large families are much less the cultural norm now making the entire doctrinal premise of the movie for a modern day mormon moot br br ahhh but it's really only as good as the music there are some catchy tunes here that just won't let this movie die the 1970's death it was pre destined for the brother and sister sing some love songs to each other that make you wonder if maybe something else was going on there wink and the tough cool kids make new kids on the block look like metallica so cheers to all that gather the family around make some jell o shooters and enjoy the show br br
<START> not totally off the wall in a good way but just totally stupid killer tongue is an uneasy mixture of sci fi horror and supposed comedy what this equates to is a mindless and totally incoherent film there is very little dialog mainly due to the fact that the script if there was one is complete pond scum i wouldn't even call it strange more like just total nonsense this movie is certain to disappoint and you have been warned there is absolutely no reason to waste time on this and if you do the pungent smell will linger like rotten fish merk
<START> pecker is a young unknown photographer from baltimore who becomes a big star in the public the media and the local art scene with his pictures showing the dirty reality of all day life just as dirty underwear or human excrements it's a typical topic of john waters baltimore based independent comedies to show the weird sides of the american way of life between political correctness fashion and conservative backlashes by exploring the backgrounds of the middle class society of his hometown br br edward furlong of terminator 2 fame plays pecker supported by christina ricchi photographer cindy sherman legendary patricia hearst and water's long time actress mink stole although the pacing of the plot becomes a big flaw sometimes and can't compete with the fast and furious joke attacks of water's brilliant serial mom it's still has some good laughs in it and some unforgettable scenes like a former junkie girl who became a vegetarian by sniffing peas from a vegetable dish pecker is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene media hypes middle class sex angst and the strange ways of how to become a pop star without realizing it recommended
<START> billy wilder is co credited for the story and his unsentimental touch is noticeable in this quite original tale of ghostwriting songwriters who both work for burnt out music legend oliver courtney the obvious misunderstandings are gotten out of the way quite quickly thank heaven and what remains is a witty and breezy concoction with some fine songs and some more forgettable ones crosby at his most charming a great turn by broadway legend mary martin and basil rathbone and oscar levant providing most of the cynical barbs levant is in rare form and his quips haven't dated at all a delightful surprise and recommended for all fans of the genre
<START> this is a direct sequel to 'the mummy's hand' 1940 because the lead character stephen banning played by dick foran is now thirty years older and is relating the story with the help of archival footage to his son's fiancÃ© there are only two unusual aspects to the film the early death of banning and the presence of turhan bey br br lon chaney as the mummy kharis gets top billing though given the nature of his role he has little more to do than limp along or thrash his arms about there's nothing scary about his presence except for his attempt to carry off the fiancÃ© isobel elyse knox dick foran gets second billing but he's killed off within the first fifteen minutes we'd have to wait until 'psycho' 1960 when a lead character janet leigh dies way before the end of the movie banning's buddy from the first film babe jenson now henson shows up a little later looking much much older and not doing any of the comic shtick he did in the original it's hard to believe it's the same actor unfortunately this great acting job is wasted because he gets killed by kharis after only two brief scenes it's then left up to banning's son john played by bit player john hubbard to led the chase to the cemetery no the sheriff leads a torch wielding mob to banning's house to burn it down and kill the mummy sound universally familiar br br turhan bey is introduced to audiences as the new high priest mehmet bey to care for and feed tana leaves to kharis with his 'exotic' voice and appearance it's too bad he gets so easily killed a better movie would have had 'babe' take von helsing type charge of things in tracking down the mummy with a final decisive battle with him and mehmet bay but instead we have a pedestrian rehash of different set pieces from previous universal horror films put together by the hack griffin jay who wrote many of universal's other clunkers although he also did 'don winslow of the navy' 1942 as well as 'don winslow of the coast guard' 1943 which also featured elyse knox br br elyse knox played anne howe in six joe palooka movies 1946 1949 and of course turhan bey with 43 movie and tv credits is great in the title role of 'the amazing dr x' 1948 br br the cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric with lots of noirish shadows in the sheriff's office than the first 'kharis' mummy film but there's little else of interest or excitement br br i'll give it a 3
<START> when i was 17 my high school staged bye bye birdie which is no great surprise since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the most staged musical in the world br br i was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs as well as a lingering disregard for the dick van dyke movie version which had deliberately obscured the elvis references and camped it up for a swinging 60s audience br br so when the 1995 version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen i was delighted with what i saw alexander turns in an exceptional performance as albert a performance in strong contrast to his better known persona from a certain tv series the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles chynna phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirl br br but best of all the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be allowing for the absence of a stage br br so if you know the musical and few do not then check out this telemovie it does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered which is good enough for me what is better than rendering a writer's work faithfully and with colour and style
<START> i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie its got a pretty good plot some good action and the change of location for harry does not hurt either sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that eastwood is in good form as dirty harry and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop if you liked dirty harry then you should see this one its a lot better than the dead pool 4 5
<START> i rented zero day from the local video store last week i had never heard of the film and i had my reservations about it just from looking at the box i knew the film was an indie film and therefore the quality was going to be less than a mainstream film br br i can tell you that after i finished watching zero day i immediately started it from the beginning again the film was clearly following the basic outline of what happened at columbine high school of april of 1999 but what struck me was how believable the two lead actors were my first time through watching this film i wasn't entirely sure if what i was watching were actual tapes left behind by the shooters at columbine in the back of my mind i knew what i was watching could not be real but at the same time the acting was so convincing you had to keep giving your head a shake br br is the film disturbing absolutely are you going to see things that will make you question the merit of the film probably i think what most people will find disturbing is they will actually have feelings for the two lead characters calvin and andre played by cal robertson and andre keuck why is that problematic for some people calvin and andre are planning a massacre at their high school i know for myself i felt an immense sadness for andre and calvin i had empathy for them because their lives had come to such a horrific point they had fallen so deeply through cracks that they had begun a journey down a road which could have been stopped if only people around them had taken notice to their plight br br zero day is a phenomenal film it gives you an up close and personal look to events that most of us will only ever see the conclusion to on the news it leaves you thinking about the lives involved and it leaves you perplexed how people get to this point a week after seeing this film i still think about it br br those of you who have not seen zero day please keep in mind the following the film is an independent with little to no budget and the film is shot on camcorders the material in the film is disturbing this is not mainstream hollywood and there is no happy ending br br but if you can put all that aside zero day is a film that will stick with you and just maybe help you to open your eyes a little
<START> i think i've seen all of the grisham movies now and generally they're all very poor except for the rainmaker but this one is so bad it's unbelievable br br warning spoilerish br br it's one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do he's a lawyer for christ's sake why when his children go missing does he not call the police oh yes it's because all the police hate lawyers so they're just ignore him and let him be attacked br br when he's arrested for murder they just let him go free he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing br br why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home br br the police don't bother to try and find an escaped mental patient they don't bother to interview his daughter br br as for the ridiculous endingÂ br br in summary silly very unrealistic and a complete waste of time br br 0 10 Â one of the worst films ever made
<START> carlos mencia was excellent this is hour special he was working hard to show everybody he was the real deal i know people have said he's stolen material in this special but that is not true carlos brings comedy up front the way he wants it not how anyone else wants it that is why he is so good people say he's not funny because he says dee dee dee too much and they still haven't realized thats part of his act and they don't want it that way but he brings it like that anyway and succeeds in making people laugh for all the haters out there here is a message carlos is here to stay you have no point in trying to bring him down
<START> this movie was horrible simply put it was so bad i registered with imdb to warn you of its dangers br br i am a campy horror film expert per se i have watched redneck zombies house of the psychotic women slumber party massacre ii and many others i know my schlock and i know this movie sucks br br three fourths of the film is comprised of scared individuals running from one side of the screen to the other when they are not running they are spouting non sequitur lines devoid of emotion or motivation when the actors begin to be acceptable the direction falls to pieces there were so many jarring low angle shots i figured leif jonker had a 3 foot tall tripod he used what i call the leif maneuver several millions times that is zooming out from an object of interest like an amateur apparently the film crew couldn't get up early enough to film a sunrise so they filmed a sunset and played it in reverse with direction this lazy you are actually impressed with the final gory scene the only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first eighty five minutes br br if you want a good bad gory movie rent riki oh or the foundational dead alive if you are a schlock buff and are looking for a challenge give darkness a go br br quote o' the movie br br vampire it's die time
<START> les visiteurs the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny i like jean reno as an actor but there was more there were unexpected twists funny situations and of course plain absurdness that would remind you a little bit of louis de funes br br now this sequel has the same characters the same actors in great part and the same time traveling the plot changes a little since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers so they jump up and down in history without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie the duke jean reno tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing but his character has been emptied so there's not a lot he can do to save the film br br now the duke's slave helper he has really all the attention the movie is merely about him and his being clumsy annoying stupid or whatever he was supposed to be fact is this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience but he does not succeed it is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke you already know but he insists on telling that joke till the end adding details to make your suffering a little longer br br if you liked les visiteurs do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel if you didn't like les visiteurs you would never consider seeing the sequel if you liked this sequel well i suppose you still need to see a lot of movies
<START> i have to be honest and say i bought this movie not because of the content but because david cubitt is in it i know shallow or what but come on mr cubitt is a fantastic actor to put it mildly br br i really didn't know what to expect from watching this movie i'd read the other write up and those on other sites but i have to say i was drawn into the world of the brothers almost from the get go david cubitt as theo and colm feore as ryan are so believable as the two estranged brothers the film moves through their relationship as they start to try getting to know each other again after their fathers death the scene where theo finds out ryan is gay was played brilliantly he literally walks in on a scene and tries to leave without ryan noticing which of course he has br br the film has been very well researched and is therefore incredibly sad moving uplifting and a celebration of life in parts i came away from this feeling sad at what ryan went through but also with the knowledge that he was given hope and unconditional love by the ex drug addict brother theo i agree with the other reviewer who finds the scene where theo says he will be a father moving and i'd go a little further to say i actually vocalised my thoughts at ryan when he cruelly says to theo 'what makes you think you can be a father' and theo says simply 'you ' theo walks away then but that small exchange of dialogue speaks volumes to the almost self pitying aspect of ryan who is brought up sharply by the simple retort br br a brilliantly conceived movie on all counts the acting directing writing etc are all so well done i can't really find anything else to say about this movie except to say that it is very hard dealing with the death of a loved one but this is done superbly to the infinite degree the respect for the subject matter and the outpouring of love without being contrite and mawkish speaks volumes in this rather selfish world we live in today well done to all concerned br br not many movies bring me to tears and give me pause to think about life in general and also to be glad for all the things i have and not be sad for the things i don't but this movie did it was unbelievably uplifting considering the subject matter
<START> whack i got this movie because elizabeth hartman was in it i was disappointed to find out she was in like two short scenes towards the end other than that i was basically hitting the fast forward button the entire time some teenager goes on a trip to romania with his dad and gets bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if there's a full moon he kills his father and friends about 30 years past but he doesn't age a bit and enrolls in a high school there he meets a shy teacher whom he ends up biting and then has kids with her this movie sucked and i don't recommend it to anyone read war and peace instead only ms hartman did a great job check out a very young bob saget in this one
<START> what a surprising treat to come across on late television had i only read a brief plot rundown on a television listing before seeing the movie i would have passed the idea of a movie about a hit man seeing a shrink wanting to leave the business and falling in love sounds trite but the film works from the start of the movie it's clear the man carries a weight on his shoulders before he even says a word the look and feel of the film is perfect dark but not obnoxiously so br br aside from the hit man family aspect which provides a touch of surrealism macy's character grapples with his marriage and his father's control macy shows a repressed sadness and his bedtime talks with his young son are amazing the young boy shows acting skills well beyond his years and the interaction between the father and son is so very natural personal and loving br br this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while and i can't believe i came across it by accident on late night television
<START> a lot has already been said on this movie and i' d like to join those who praised it it's a highly unique film which uses elements of different genres drama comedy gangster film without making a mess of it at points you just laugh out loud at other points you feel for the characters whose mistakes and failures you watch sabu's genius can be shown with regard to some sequences of the movie one is that where all three men chasing one another have an erotic day dream about a young woman that they just passed by on the street this sequence is beautifully done and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well it is erotic and funny at the same time another example of sabu's genius is the part of the film where the runners get tired first one of them the typical loser among the three guys hallucinates that the woman that left him for someone else is back again and you see them dancing with one another and in the next shot him dancing with himself which is deeply moving all of the runners get to this point where they think that have something back they lost or are on track again and at one part of the movie they stop chasing each other running in line just laughing so here is it all the beauty and the ludicrousness of what we call life which sabu manages to show throughout the film his characters fail do they at the end but he doesn't rob them of their dignity monday and postman blues that do justice to sabu's claim that he is a genius go watch them br br
<START> i cannot stand this show has there ever been even one redeeming quality one funny punchline or one plot line that didn't make the average viewer want to drown himself in a bowl of soggy cornflakes br br the voices oh those horrible wretched voices akin to repeatedly dragging a set of fine cutlery across a dusty blackboard each character is uniquely annoying in his or her aptitude for shrill nasal vocals cosmo sounds like a whining mongrel vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew and timmy's dad makes every line sound like a bad impersonation of a game show host guy smiley from sesame street comes to mind br br the animation is awful even the producers of yu gi oh laugh at the overwhelmingly bad artwork on this show every character has buck teeth or a square head or a head three sizes too big for his or her body and what's with having the characters speak every single line wide eyed and grinning as though posing for a photo op with the president then there is the fact that every character on the show is completely moronic not since the subtle grace of amelia bedelia homer simpson and buddy lembeck of charles in charge fame have characters been portrayed as so unrealistically dumb usually unrealistic is synonymous with unfunny and that is most definitely the case here there hasn't been this much slapstick based on cluelessness since the naked gun 33 1 3 and at least leslie nielson was good at it br br finally the premise of the show and it's the same every single episode so big time spoiler alert here timmy wishes for something with his two fairly oddparents something goes wrong there's always some contrived reason why he can't immediately reverse course and wish away the damage and then everything turns out just fine in the end oh and on a side note timmy's parents never believe him when he complains about vicky and they continue to employ her at every opportunity maybe it's just me but it seems that a kids' show containing the subtle message that it pretty much does no good whatsoever to tell on an abusive babysitter probably isn't a great idea br br if you're writing a paper and want to cite an example of just how far the quality of cartoons has fallen the fairly odd parents has to be a great place to start a prime example of television producers throwing together a worthless product aimed at kids with little or no effort simply because they know that someone somewhere will watch it
<START> when i was a kid i remember watching this while visiting a friend of our uncle phil we're back a dinosaur's story is a silly cartoon about a dinosaur called rex voiced by the wonderful john goodman he tells a little boy dinosaur the story about how the dinosaurs came back to earth to live he explains that he was part of the thing that brought them back along with some friends the doctor professor villain of this film i think might have been responsible for them being them back but i don't care about him the kids might like this but personally it is just too cheesy john goodman was probably the only decent thing poor
<START> yes this movie make me feel real horror when i realized that i paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to watch it the bald guy just give me the impression of being a psycho junkie actor and the girl is the worst actress i ever seen believe me if you appreciate your time avoid this movie i understand a movie requires money to be created and some movies do not have that money but that is no justification for a stupid plot and bad acting i'm always supporting independent movies when it deserves the support but movies like this makes a bad name for this kind of movies i'm still traumatized i will not trust in any nice cover anymore
<START> a film destined to be on late night tv long after the present instant money makers have long been forgotten perhaps a little too subtle for today's youngsters but in time they'll grow into an appreciation of this movie
