<START> 2 stars out of a possible 10 and that is being overly generous br br i thought with a cast of james woods cathy bates randy quaid lou gossett jr and henry thomas how could it miss i was wrong br br i can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the week end he cranked out this piece of dribble i'd long suspected sam s of being kind of nuts this film based on his play confirms it br br this is the kind of artsy b s that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote however for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie br br you haven't seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this bunch pa is crazy ma is crazy the son is crazy and the daughter is oh yeah crazy they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush especially the teenage daughter br br in addition to the above as if that weren't enough the plot and it's so thin you could read thorough it has a hole in it the size of alaska br br ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm as it turns out so is pa now i don't claim to be a real estate expert but the last time i checked property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold if only one of them owned the property then the other could not legally sell it so it would be pointless for that person to do so mr shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact and therefore his plot does not work br br not that anything else was really working anyway br br the only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity and i can't imagine why anyone would want to
<START> i saw the latter half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it available on dvd recently i watched several of the reality series on pbs about ranching etc none of them came as close to telling the story as this movie does based on real reality pulling no punches bleak happy tragic and enlightening this is a movie that should be shown to students or to anyone interested in early frontier life fine acting on the part of both rip torn and conchata ferrell add to an well done script the opening credit states that it was done though funds supplied through the national endowment for the humanities if this is the kind of product taxes could go to i would be happy to see more i highly recommend it and would encourage people to tell a friend if you have seen it and enjoyed the film
<START> this movie is one of my favourites it is a genre mixture with ingredients of the action horror romantic comedygenre some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards this minor flaw is easily ignored there is so much to discover in this story the romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts the visuals are beautiful too the action is great which is no surprise it is originating from honkong birthplace of the world's best action movies the humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way somehow this movie is being able to balance the different moods and keeps being good absolutely recommended
<START> this film can't make up its mind whether its message is humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless or don't ever go in the water again a fisherman nolan is out to nab a killer whale a very bad thing but when he accidentally accidentally mark you hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate the cow and i use the word in all senses who is obviously a sick psycho bitch and the canonical villain of the piece throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself i doubt it was her first when her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self inflicted wounds her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to nolan obviously as among humans total psychos date other total psychos br br the film reeks of half thought out anti human message the poor poor whale the evil men must suffer and die and yet it does not succeed in demonizing nolan at all it's true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and as the film progresses he grows more and more compassionate to the whale's pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale just to make it feel a little better br br the films final journey in which nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north reminds me of melville's eerie man whale connection and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion where these two husbands might connect understand even respect each other in their own grief for nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident it's clear nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss however it never goes there the whale character has no compassion or respect for anyone br br the final scene loses this focus and becomes jaws like where the sea monster finally kills everybody and nolan and no doubt through an oversight fails to chomp up the whale hugger tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier i love animals and i detest whaling and what is more i love orca whales but if this film's goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed nolan shows compassion and growth and feels for others and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming br br the only message one can walk away with is if you see an orca whale ever anywhere run the other way cause if you step on his fin the wrong way he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you
<START> this cute animated short features two comic icons betty boop and henry br br henry is the bald slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks br br well here he does speak br br he wants to get a puppy from betty boop's pet store and when he is left to mind the store some hilarious hijinks ensue br br betty sings a song about pets henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey but everything works out in the end
<START> i don't think i've ever felt this let down by a film before after loving guy ritchie's two previous films i don't count swept away he was pussy blind i was so looking forward to seeing this br br the reviews were poor then again i don't trust the press anyway more worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stinker so it was with some trepidation i handed over my Â£4 80 yesterday afternoon br br i'm not even going to try to explain this film mainly because i haven't got a clue what was going on and at one point i was honestly close to standing up and asking if it was just me who didn't get it br br unfortunately i think ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap of taking himself far too seriously it seems it wasn't good enough for him to make films with good plots laughs snappy dialogue and good characters it's almost as if he had a checklist of films he wanted to rip off here are some of the ones i noticed br br the matrix fight club kill bill the usual suspects vanilla sky br br i think the most frustrating thing is that the performances from the two main actors jason statham and ray liotta were actually very good and it was really the self indulgent story and editing direction that let the film down br br so a big big thumbs down from me
<START> for domestic audiences i can see how they would applaud this movie for outsiders with no vested interests it did not make much sense the germans were portrayed as incompetents and the russians as heroes the supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction how a young woman could 'love' the lieutenant from just glimpsing him was nonsense how she could as mentioned at the end of the movie never marry just because of this infatuation was beyond me i mentioned the germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the chase into the marsh several hundred german troops advanced pushing the russians into the marsh so the russians hid and the germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and just stood there listening i suppose they did not want to get their boots wet but i am sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to search the marsh but that would have ended the story also the germans entered the barn where the russians were hiding in the loft and did not bother to fire into the roof at the worst some soldier would have tossed a grenade into the loft and not climbed a ladder to peer in br br i did see some reviewers who said they cried at the end i wonder why you knew this small band would perish and they was nothing heart tugging in that
<START> this is definitely one of the weirder 70's movies out there and it's most notable for kicking off a decade of bigfoot hysteria it is also notable for the little touches of insanity throughout the movie especially when the dark moody first half is replaced by a musical interlude of all things as another user pointed out one of the songs is dedicated to a character travis crabtree who paddles around in a canoe for a while then leaves never to be seen again although it's painfully dated now i's still a fun scary movie to show to kids and anyone who enjoys either bigfoot lore or 70's hillbilly culture is bound to get a kick out of this my favorite part a guy gets so scared that he jumps headfirst through a door and the narrator explains he went unconscious from shock uh i'd say breaking a door with his head is more likely why he went unconscious but whatever br br 4 10 stars or 7 10 if you like bad americana
<START> they probably could have skipped some of the beginning i'm not sure why this starts out in the asian part of turkey if it was because starting in the mediterranean they could have gotten closer starting in modern day lebanon br br one the cameras and crews get to the bakhtyari tribe it's the beginning of an amazing 48 day journey 50 000 people with about 250 000 goats camels cattle and horses make this amazing trek across what seems to be a very fast moving karun river they use rafts that are kept afloat by inflating goat skins you can see where the head and legs were removed the other bank of the river was very steep i'm guessing about a 60 degree rise br br just watching that was incredible but there was much more to come to get to the pastures they also had to cross a major mountain that had about 4 feet of snow if not more being able to climb this mountain was pretty amazing in and of itself but they and all of the animals climbed this mountain barefoot yes barefoot br br the one drawback to this documentary were some of the inter titles with poor attempts at humor br br if you want to see a documentary from the silent era or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only face but conquer this is just an incredible document of a little known group of people facing all kinds of challenges
<START> john wayne albert dekker compete for oil rights on indian territory and for the attention of martha scott in this republic pictures film shot out of utah usa br br an interesting western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting with wayne dekker playing the old and new factions of the west it's based on a story by thomson burtis who co writes the script along with eleanore griffin and ethel hill albert rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career a pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse the light hearted approach to the romantic strand doesn't sit quite right and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work but hey stunt men deserve their moment of glory always solid support comes from george 'gabby' hayes and wayne as usual has much screen charisma particularly when rattling off his pistol but in spite of its better than usual republic budget it remains a film of interest only to 1940s wayne enthusiasts 4 10
<START> i admit creating great expectations before watching because some friends mentioned it and they are not pervs as a must see and it is a must see just don't expect to see something outbreaking br br the freudian psychoanalyzes are interesting in many parts of the film but there's just too much perversion and it doesn't stick in the end br br some of the good things are the analyzes of kieslowski's blue most of david lynch's some of hitchcock's and perhaps a couple more i missed i just remembered dogville and i usually don't miss things unless they are too obvious or loose in the air br br other than being repetitive which makes it too long the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of noticing some perversions fed by our unconscious hence the commercial success of most thrillers studied and used as basis for this theory br br i really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of mr zizek to revive freud's theory which has been numb for too long specially in north america again it's way over the top and i believe not to be a completely waste of time for i do believe most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood
<START> i just picked up the dvd release of this movie while on holiday in norway where it has been released with english subtitles br br the film is beautifully photographed and powerfully acted the youngster portraying 'frits' the lead character has an astonishingly open face which mirrors with painful accuracy the tragic events which unfold around him br br early on in the film we see that the father whom frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is brought up when the brutal headmaster denies assaulting the boy and suggests it was his own father br br the climactic scene where frits refuses to show any respect to the headmaster simply standing his ground and repeating 'liar' as he is brutally assaulted in front of his classmates is a scene you are not likely to forget br br the films only weak point is the rather clichÃ©d 'flower power' teacher who uses every 'friendly teacher' trick in the book other than this i feel sure that this is a film you will really enjoy
<START> the show is average it doesn't make me laugh particularly however i think courtney really brings it down she doesn't look natural she has these three ways to talk all robotic she talks quietly with no intonation she talks normally with no intonation or she does that thing where she starts talking normally and starts yelling gradually however her yelling is like let's pretend i'm yelling because i shouldn't be too loud on the set br br she is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing it's annoying you can't really get her personality because she doesn't really produce emotion and doesn't get upset she has this husband who's doing all these stupid things and there is no reaction from her very dry and plain acting
<START> until now the worst movie i had ever seen was ben arthur you really should check the reviews for that movie instead of this one the review statistics for this movie have been skewed positive through a relentless and unscrupulous push by some of the people involved in making it evidence for which is fairly easy to uncover online at least the people who made ben arthur were honorable enough to let it stand on its own shaky legs instead of unscrupulously promoting it so suckers like me would buy it br br everything about this movie is terrible the script the story the casting the acting the direction the photography the editing the music what else goes into a movie whatever it is here it's as bad as it gets if it weren't so unpleasant it would be ridiculous i kept watching it thinking it must get better because i hadn't yet discovered that none of the positive reviews for it are reliable br br it does not take a lot of money to make a great movie nor does a low budget mean a movie has to be bad my favorite example of a shoestring budget masterpiece is gus van sant's amazing mala noche but there are many others sideline secretsÂdirector's cut or originalÂis bad not because the people who made it had no money but because they had gigantic egos and no talent for anything at all except self promotion
<START> when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film yet having read the content i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie the effect surprised me totally i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me a vow to cherish is without any doubt one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema br br first the entire content is particularly educational it has something to offer to the modern audience pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions is there a need for christ in our times does love still matter what for is there faith what is the logics of burden and suffering in life is there really someone by my side i can always trust the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us br br second the movie is exceptionally humane the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions is it better for kyle david denman and teri megan paul to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home is it better for john ken howard to leave ellen barbara babcock his sick wife and start a new happy life with julia donna bullock a woman he falls in love with in fact ellen no longer recognizes him yet he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity had john's rebellious brother phil d david morin better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life phil's prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where when or how they live br br third the movie is a great portrayal of family not very popular nowadays there are problems yet there is always something more powerful that gets these people together this something is love and trust i know that it may seem a bit idealistic not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that nevertheless it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one br br fourth the entire film focuses on people's mutual help if we want to live happy lives in our society we must understand one thing we have to help one another alexander ossie davis is an example of such attitude at the beginning of the movie we see him talk to john about praying later he helps his brother alexander is a kinda angel that is sent to john and his family isn't it possible that we may become angels to one another br br fifth the artistic features are also worth attention performances barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role she does a perfect job consider for instance the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband picture the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves autumn while the sunshine love spreads everywhere i interpreted as a sort of symbol even if there is sorrow this can always be illuminated by light and joy br br a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe at the end i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do br br kyle to his uncle phil yes he john brighton lives according to the bible but nobody forces you to do so yet according to what rules do you live
<START> while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age the movie was made as it is now 2002 an official five years ago after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings and science fiction feats like star wars as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homer's the odyssey br br my beef basically is that i couldn't relate i am just about the same age of the children a young adult and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle aged man if that is the character available but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence i didn't find myself saying 'ack i would have done the same thing ' it did not open the doors to my imagination even without comparing it to high budget films or other tv movies standing alone certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish teenager bitter after divorce image changing into the we're a big happy family let's never separate again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement a typical set of one or the other stereotypes there was the ever present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious accompanied by mr perfect image of combining athletics good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude and lastly the smart aleck little brother we find to be so common these days while i know the personalities pushed the story along i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable and believable as far as character movie br br i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design that made it worth finishing to the end for me don't get me wrong all movies are worth seeing for yourself and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many but i think that with a little more depth to the script and a little more i cannot believe i am saying this realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical
<START> i wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics br br overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess the movie was quite short though around 85 min but it was enough to tell the whole story build some character development and have a decent happy ending the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast especially jason biggs kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace br br overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating hey its a chick flick and i'm reviewing this movie from a guy's persepctive alright it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it
<START> this movie is phoniness incarnate a straight 11 10 on the phoniness scale the fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering yanks although the real scotland may be just as colourful if you ever go there don't expect to be given much of a the chance to dance out controversies with the locals also don't attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancing br br there are a couple of infectious singing and dancing scenes but the plot is far too cheesy and linear and the dialogue is often too weak i also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18 th century scottish village in the boondocks rather than gay new york city maybe it wasn't such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left brigadoon maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump br br watch it for the fine alternative reality view of what a christopher streed day parade in scotland would look like on lsd other than that i'd only recommend it to hollywood muscial completists
<START> don't waste time reading my review go out and see this astonishingly good episode which may very well be the best columbo ever written ruth gordon is perfectly cast as the scheming yet charming mystery writer who murders her son in law to avenge his murder of her daughter columbo is his usual rumpled befuddled and far cleverer than he seems self and this particular installment features fantastic chemistry between gordon and falk ironically this was not written by heralded creators levinson or link yet is possibly the densest most thoroughly original and twist laden columbo plot ever utterly satisfying in nearly every department and overflowing with droll and witty dialogue and thinking truly unexpected and inventive climax tops all 10 10 seek this one out on netflix
<START> if you want to see intelligent philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential watch waking life which is brilliant what the do we know is all over the place in its focus poorly directed poorly written poorly acted utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying it wasn't thought provoking or entertaining in the slightest the inclusion of that rambling freak ramtha in this film is reason enough to avoid it isn't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2 000 year old atlantian god or something what a flake that old chick is and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was the people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again
