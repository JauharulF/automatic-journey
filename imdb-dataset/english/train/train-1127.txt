<START> the movie is truly poignant unique and uplifting the story is universal in that it's a battle between good evil and the world between the most important thing is that its rating is wrong misleading and a travesty blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub titles
<START> this is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 the national film preservation foundation says 1969 and imdb says 1972 regardless of the exact date the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period with some camera work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s early 70s br br the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art and like most performance art it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome the film to put it even more bluntly is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and with it to be understood by us mortals
<START> the first and only time i saw shades was during a sneakpreview it hadn't even been in premiere i remember there was someone of the directors staff there don't even remember who it was a belgian movie we never heard of it so we were quite neutral not knowing what to expect mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and he's stands miles ahead all the rest he plays an actor who's star has long stopped rising he's helping to realise a movie in belgium entitled shades br br as soon as the movie started we noticed how much swearing there is nothing against the occasional swear word however this was way beyond annoying whenever rourke uses the f word to express something it comes naturally however when someone from the cast a non english speaker uses the f or s word it becomes arrogant and aggressive br br we quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre and we had to give a vote but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10 and we were looking for the 10
<START> i saw this in the summer of 1990 i'm still annoyed by how bad this movie is in 2001 br br implausible plot you'd have to be a child to think this could happen br br i'm just really annoyed by it don't see this
<START> the movie atlantis the lost empire is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the disney studios recently parents who have had to sit through the jungle book 2 or even a pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one br br the film is one of few to attempt at an original story previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories films such as toy story finding nemo and monsters inc all do the same but it must be noted that all were made by pixar and only distributed by disney recent films from the disney studios are mostly released direct to video and are sequels to an existing successful film the quality of those films is given way to the profitability a new era started with atlantis following it were mulan lilo stitch and most recently open range the writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past br br a good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find atlantis a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years including that of young milo thatch voiced by michael j fox milo is employed by a museum in washington d c his grandfather was a renowned archaeologist who had devoted his life to discovering atlantis this was seen as a waste by his peers and they wish milo to not follow in his footsteps after failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment she takes him to her employer a mr whitmore whitmore was a close friend of milo's grandfather and wishes to send milo with a team to locate atlantis mr whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything the crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers the journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch the viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach atlantis the plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery atlantis not just the discovery of people it is enough to keep the interest of the older audience br br the animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation the movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with computer generated images a feat not easily achieved most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two the characters are believably human there are some nice chase type scenes with lots of action going on a few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get br br the creativity of the writers really shines through the culture of atlantis is richly developed including an entire language the film uses references to atlantis from historical sources such as plato the disappearance of atlantis from the world is explained believable if by a younger audience that magic really does exist the powers of the people of atlantis are not exactly presented as magic but can best be described in this way br br although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic the voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of captain nemo's nautilus complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes the giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology the female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been even holding roles in leadership this is not a bad thing it gives a good role model for my daughter to look to rather than an all male cast br br one reason this film is a favorite of mine over other disney films is that there is not one single song ever a tradition that began with the first feature film snow white and carried on through to the lion king almost every disney film is full of upbeat songs this is great and all what would the seven dwarfs be without hi ho after the millionth time through it'd almost be better without but this one spares the parent not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song i for one am grateful br br the storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike it is a film i am willing to watch again and again with my children
<START> i give this five out of 10 all five marks are for hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling we have countless full face shots of hendrix where he could almost be doing anything taking a pee perhaps we don't see his hands on the guitar thats the point also we're given plenty shots of hendrix from behind there appears to be three cameras on hendrix but amateur fools operate all of them the guy in front of hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction while the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the amps the sound recording is good thanks to wally heider interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers protesting against vietnam etc on tracks like machine gun complete waste of film if hendrix had lived even another two years berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes the one gem it does contain is the incredible johnny b good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both woodstock and isle of wight
<START> just look at the poor robert webber character great performance once again who tries to wrestle a sub machine gun from one of the terrorists everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong the biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a firm footing in the actuality of the early 1980ies the fundamental difference between this flick and the far more fantastic ironic and therefore timeless die hard the story comes through as a failed attempt to glorify the sas commandos ideas like when a commando shouts Âheads down all good guys do it and all bad guys don't so that they can blast away ad lib with a good conscience that the main character does not get mown down by the gas masked commandos although he wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from their arsenal just seem to be unlikely and make it hard to take the movie seriously and it just happens that it tries to be more than just fun don't talk about the toilet mirror signal episode br br i don't mind the criticism of the pacifist movement as a shield for evildoers and the arguments between the peace fanatics and the settled even headed representatives of power in this movie but the political comment is rather lame and uninspired this is insofar regrettable as the movie features an early performance of judy davies she plays the main fanatic and seems to have done extensive studies on the Âsubject anyway her performance is a notch above that of the others and somehow i feel the movie let her down
<START> yes the cameras were in the right place at the right time it's so interesting to see how a world leader like chavez who supports the poor people in his country can be held in such low esteem in the us his worst sin in my opinion is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel what can be so bad about that i have always been fascinated by the us government media reaction to fidel castro at first castro was a good guy around 1959 when he supplanted batista soon however castro started turning the corporations in cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats we're a decent country but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor if these guys are dictators then we could use more dictatorships especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world
<START> ok ok don't get bent out of round i was kidding br br bustin' out is actually a better and truer title anyhoo br br racism and crime dramas get the satiric treat meant from our x rated animator friend ralphie boy and he does one of his better jobs here br br on the crime front it shows the truth they build it defend it then boredom and stronger rivals cause them to maybe lose it see for yourself to see what goes down br br racist i don't know with scatman rip and the love walrus also rip being black and the main point of view i saw it as an attack on racism mostly the fact that richard pryor liked it says as much as well and the younger pre miami vice phil mike thomas in there was a nice surprise br br it's an animated blacksploitation film that's a good thing done well and well done it will make some squirm like the lynching scene but unfortunately that's based on fact br br but ralphie really should have re thought that title
<START> i first saw this movie when i was a freshman in high school and the film has stuck with me through the years it's not about the soundtrack or cinematography or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting it's about the educational purpose and the message behind that is the most important it's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school and it's not really a bad thing either but it is a problem tons of girls i knew are all having children now and i guess they never watched this great movie and if they did they clearly didn't get the message behind it all it's about not taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship any girl can get pregnant the first time it's not a myth you don't necessarily lose out on your dreams but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first br br this movie has a clear message behind it just say no
<START> at the point in time that the lady from shanghai was being made the marriage of orson welles and rita hayworth was disintegrating the film was as much an effort by welles to rekindle the old flames as it was to make a classic noir not received well at the time the lady from shanghai has gotten more and more critical acclaim as years pass gotten better with age so to speak br br welles is irish seaman michael o'hara who on a fateful night rescues the beautiful rita hayworth from three muggers in central park sparks do fly but then comes the rub turns out the lady is married to crippled but brilliant criminal attorney everett sloane nevertheless sloane takes an apparent liking to welles and hires him to skipper his yacht br br so far this film is starting to sound a lot like gilda if orson had seen gilda and was not at this point thinking with his male member he would have skedaddled back to the seaman's hiring hall in lower manhattan instead he gets himself involved in a lovely web or intrigue and finds himself pegged for two murders and sloane as his eminent counsel br br welles for whatever reason decided that his wife would be a blond in this film supposedly harry cohn hit the roof as rita was internationally known for her coppery red hair this may have soured him on the picture as he joined the legion of studio bosses who saw welles's vision of independent film making a threat to their power br br stage actor glenn anders plays sloane's partner grisby who is one slimy dude he winds up a corpse the other corpse to be here is ted decorsia a bottom feeding private detective who tries to go in business for himself br br it's a good noir thriller showing rita at her glamorous best even if she was a blond here the final shoot out in the hall of mirrors is beautifully staged but i wouldn't recommend seeing it if one is on any controlled substance
<START> the first time you see the second renaissance it may look boring look at it at least twice and definitely watch part 2 it will change your view of the matrix are the human people the ones who started the war is ai a bad thing
<START> i first watched this movie on its release in 1987 and was greatly affected emotionally through a combination of guilt at what my fellow white human beings could do to innocent people and the reluctance of the outside world to really investigate these atrocities against man br br particularly moving was the funeral of steve biko made even more vivid and hard hitting by the south african anthem played at the time i have long believed that this movie achieved what nobody else had managed to open the eyes of the world to what was really happening in south africa i consider myself to be a normal right thinking person and i can attest to how this film changed my whole way of thinking about not just south africa but how we as white people perceive black people i have never seen any difference between people of any colour or creed but after viewing this film i physically changed my life and have spent the last 17 years living in a predominantly black country and helping many people rise above their present standard of living and achieve that which they would not have thought possible the greatest reward i can honestly say i have received to be able to say that in my own small way i have contributed and redressed the balance a little but if more people thought like me and actually did something to help black people without seeking reward then the entire black population of this planet would be a little better off br br i challenge any right thinking person to watch cry freedom from beginning to end and not feel that emotion tugging at your heartstrings as you witness the 700 schoolchildren brutally shot dead in sharpville for refusing to learn afrikaans the senseless murder of steve biko such a champion for his own people's rights and then ultimately to understand that all this is not merely a film albeit a magnificent one but that it all actually happened and less than 30 years ago br br yes my friends watch this movie and then see if you can go out afterwards and party hard i couldn't i was too upset at knowing the truth that is the hallmark of a great film it was obviously the intention of sir richard attenborough to get this message over about south africa of course he has achieved it unless you happen to support apartheid god help you
<START> this is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun but i appreciated this light hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level think about it the crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and alice from wonderland a bengal tiger a samurai warrior a knight on horseback who kills mccoy and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't make any sense at all until the very end despite all the danger you just can't take everything very seriously it's just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal so on a purely non aesthetic level it's great stuff
<START> i typically don't like reality shows particularly the ones that are profiting off of american idol 's success but this one i can live with br br comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts and if they like them those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do survivor style competitions using comedic tactics then one will be determined as last comic standing i do like stand up comedy so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests there are usually some pretty funny comics selected through it started the careers of such talents as alonzo bodden ralphie may and josh blue br br my negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama at first they lived together in a house like big brother but now they've done away with that thank god br br and there are a lot of comedians i felt were only chosen not because they're funny but because of race ethnicity attitude sex etc when other comics clearly should've beaten them out but overall it's a well made reality show which are two terms up until now i thought were an oxymoron
<START> ok first the good cher's performance and the cinematography although i'm no cher fan she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written the cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romance br br the rest a thin plotline nicholas cage's performance and a totally unhumorous and weak attempt to portray an italian american family from new york firstly everytime time cage opened his mouth i cringed i don't know what kind of accent he was trying use i honestly don't it sure wasnt any new york or italian accent i've ever heard it was quite surreal and it wasn't because i'm some stickler for accuracy his voice just cloyed in my ears and i like nicholas cage in other performances secondly and this is purely anecdotal but i have many italian relations friends and acquaintances in new york city and frankly i've gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided and that would be on a boring night at the house what a let down
<START> each of the major studios cranked out jazzy one reelers throughout the thirties and forties with universal taking the lead while most looked as cheap on screen as they were to make warner bros which abruptly stopped making them in 1946 often distinguished theirs with offbeat camera angles mirrors and optical effects thanks to some creative directors like jean negulesco it is fitting that the best of this genre should come from this studio br br what sets jammin' the blues apart from the rest of the pack is that it more closely resembles an avant garde experiment than a hollywood musical filmed in july 1944 it transforms an ordinary jam session into a trippy dream escape from war time troubles highlighted by the tune of on the sunny side of the street gjon mili and cameraman robert burkes later to work with hitchcock were allowed plenty of artistic freedom perhaps because lester young was not glenn miller and the studio could care less how he and his fellow musicians were presented the optical printer is put to good use with multiple images of the same performer appearing at once norman mclaren really milked this process two decades later in pas de deux while linwood dunn's team achieved different effects in citizen kane the strong emphasis on silhouettes and lit cigarette smoke was also ahead of its time in some ways this predated the psychedelic sixties but with a distinctly forties film noir style
<START> the third collaboration for karloff and lugosi sees a move away from poe and into the realm of the science fiction serial karloff plays dr janos rukh creator of a device that can capture light rays through his telescope in the carpathian mountains and translate them into pictures that form a visual history of the universe br br before several guests including lugosi as dr benet an astro chemist who had previously scoffed at rukh's theories he demonstrates the existence of an unknown radioactive element here termed radium x contained in a meteor that fell to earth in darkest africa several thousand years ago karloff joins the expedition to prove his theories but radium x is a tricky compound it levels mountains at long range and cures blindness at short range rukh is careless however and poisons himself glowing in the dark rather like those old ready breck commercials dr benet is on hand to devise a counter active for the radiation but combination of poison and cure drives rukh insanely paranoid convinced he has been cheated he seeks out the members of the expedition in paris including his estranged wife and his very touch while in his radioactive state means death br br along the way we get the old pseudo scientific idea that a dead person's eyes record the image of their killer a remarkably distinct karloff and the radium x device used to symbolically melt statues that represent the expedition members and even a touch of james whale in a cockney landlady in paris br br the invisible ray is great fun aside from the gothic opening it's interesting to see universal move the action around to africa and paris the film lacks pace but is always absorbing karloff slightly overdoes his performance but lugosi is terrific universal used the basic story outline again in man made monster this time with lon chaney jr as the glowing menace this time caused by electricity and lionel atwill as a much madder doctor than lugosi is here the invisible ray is a sombre and clever little film with much to admire not as famous as other universal horrors perhaps but it works and is highly entertaining
<START> it is a rare occasion when i want to see a movie again the amati girls is such a movie in old time movie theaters i would have stayed put for more showings was this story autobiographical for the writer director it has the aura of reality br br the all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness who would not want mercedes ruehl as an older sister i have loved her work since for roseanna br br with most movies one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors producers directors sound technicians etc it was hard to suspend such belief in the amati girls one feels such a part of this family how i wanted to come to the defense of dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life and wanted to cheer lee grant as she levels criticism at cloris leachman's hair color the humor throughout is not belly laugh humor but instead has a feel good quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and such br br the love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherished br br it is no coincidence that the family name amati translated from the italian means 'the loved ones'
<START> the only reason i even gave it a 1 out of 10 is because the option to give it zero out of 10 was not allowed this was the biggest waste of time i've ever endured for roughly 75 minutes you are subjected to the worst acting and i don't mean that in a good way either like as in killer nerd which had great horrible acting and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also has absolutely nothing to do with a massacre the reason i even rented this piece of crap was because it has massacre in the title that said there was only one killing in the entire movie and it was pretty lame at that you spend more time watching the kids bickering and doing yard work than anything speaking of the kids the little boy actor is probably the most irritating child actor since bob from house by the cemetery did i mention it was shot on video as well if you want to throw away money and over an hour of your life then by all means watch it but if you savor your hard earned dollars and time then stray as far away as possible
