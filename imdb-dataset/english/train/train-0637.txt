<START> after not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the 20th century in 1908 playwright d w griffith got the job that would make him a legend he was hired by the biograph company as a director of movies it wasn't really what griffith had expected when he decided to enter the movie business but he accepted the job and in less than a year he became biograph's most successful director thanks to his original approach to film making and the wild inventive of his narrative many years later he would direct the birth of a nation in 1915 the movie that would revolutionize film making and make him one of cinema's first recognized authors however a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for biograph company in the early years of his career 1909's the sealed room is one of those and also one of the few horror movies of that very first decade of the 20th century br br the sealed room is a story set in the 16th century in which a count arhtur v johnson has built a windowless room in his castle it is a small yet nice and very cozy room as it is meant to be used to enjoy the love and company of his wife the countess marion leonard in a more private way however the count doesn't know that his wife is not exactly faithful as she is infatuated with the minstrel henry b walthall at court with whom she is having an affair as soon as the count gets busy with his own business the countess calls the minstrel and both lovers go to enjoy the count's new room when the count returns he discovers she is missing and begins to suspect finally discovering the two lovers in his room but instead of making a scene he prefers to remain hidden as he decides that there is a better punishment for his unfaithful wife to seal the windowless room with the couple inside br br written by griffiths' regular collaborator frank e woods the sealed room takes elements from edgar allan poe's the cask of amontillado and mainly honorÃ© de balzac's la grande breteche to create a haunting gothic melodrama based on the themes of treachery and sadism despite having a runtime of 11 minutes woods' screenplay develops the story in a very good way and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story while a melodrama at heart woods focus on the character of the count and his sadism creates one of the best horror characters of these early era the sealed room is definitely a very simple and basic story but woods handling of the dark and morbid thematic of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most griffith's melodramas br br in the sealed room griffith uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual while he often played with editing to create thrillers that excited his audience in this movie his focus was to create desperation and horror playing with the inherent feeling of claustrophobia that the source stories had it is interesting how the story starts as another of his melodramas and slowly the pacing becomes faster as the horror themes begin to dominate the plot culminating in his great use of editing for the final scenes not being a movie where camera tricks are essential what shines the most in the sealed room is griffith's talent to direct his actors as the legendary filmmaker manages to bring the best out of his cast with his usual natural style far removed from the staginess that was the norm in his day br br as usual the cast was comprised of usual collaborators of griffith starting with arthur v johnson as the count johnson gives a great performance and truly conveys the character's transition from loving husband to sadistic monster his performance is not without a touch of overacting but actually that adds realism to the character's exaggerated personality as the countess marion leonard looks very good and is also very effective in her acting conveying a natural charm that makes hard not to sympathize with her in her treachery finally the legendary henry b walthall appears as the handsome minstrel and while far from being one of his best performances he manages to give a proficient acting that also adds a nice touch of comedy to the film while not of real importance to the plot it's nice to see other members of griffith's stock company in the background like his wife linda arvidson and a young mary pickford as nobles at court br br while not exactly a masterpiece the sealed room is a notable exercise of editing to create suspense and tension like griffith used to do in those days the movie has very good set design and while of a very low budget griffith's care for details makes it look very convincing and works perfectly along with his directing style the change of focus to horror makes it to stand out among other of his films from that era and johnson's performance as the sadistic count makes it worth a watch while griffith will always be remembered for his highly influential and controversial the birth of a nation the early short films he made before it really give a good idea of the development of the techniques and the style that would make him a legend simple yet elegant the sealed room is a fun movie to watch and one of the few horrors of the first decade of the 20th century 7 10
<START> i suppose that any novel that's as much of a downer as moby dick would not find much favor with depression era audiences who had enough of their own troubles but any resemblance to the classic herman melville novel is a pure coincidence br br in fact half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it not that too much of it was kept for the film we first meet ahab creely he's got a last name and a brother as one happy go lucky soul with two legs and intentions to marry joan bennett who is father mapple's daughter that brother derek played by lloyd hughes also wants to marry bennett br br john barrymore is ahab in an over the top performance barrymore had not quite mastered the sound cinema and he gave out with all the silent era histrionics plus a stage voice that would have shaken the rafters of any movie theater this film was playing in br br we see ahab lose his leg to the great whale moby dick and i have to say the amputation scene was pretty gruesome of course this was all before the code still i'm sure 1930 audiences shuddered br br after that the story of ahab's hunt for the whale that he thinks made him unsightly in joan bennett's eyes that is not exactly melville's motivation in fact there are no women characters in moby dick as he wrote it br br one of the things melville did was invest the crew of ahab's ship the pequod with personalities other than queequeg the cannibal harpooner the names are there but not the personalities starbuck and stubbs might as well be smith and jones br br i'd see this version of moby dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else
<START> i never understood why some people dislike bollywood films they've got charismatic actors great dance numbers and heightened emotion what's not to like what i didn't realize was that i had only seen the upper crust of bollywood then i watched garam masala i could tell from the first scene that this was not a movie i was going to like the film opens with a montage of the two leads driving around a city and apparently happening serendipitously on a series of photo setups populated with gyrating models but i kept hoping things would improve sadly they didn't the main problem is that the two protagonists mac sam are completely unsympathetic they spend the entire movie lying to women and lying brutally in order to get them into bed and the audience is supposed to find this funny and be charmed the boys are unscrupulous and inept and not in a lovable way mac even goes so far as to have one of the women drugged in order to keep her from discovering his cheating the script is extremely poor with repetitive scenes setups that never lead to anything and illogical actions and statements by the characters in fact the characters are never really developed at all the males are boorish greedy jerks and the women merely interchangeably beautiful if you go by this movie you would think that air hostesses are pretty easy to pass from man to man in reality betrayal is not so humorous br br the only bright spots i found in the movie were one dance number that had brilliant sets and a few slapsticky moments involving the french farce door slamming aspects of the story but bollywood dancing is better enjoyed in movies choreographed by farah khan and for slapstick you might as well just go straight to the silent comedies of buster keaton and harold lloyd who seem to have influenced writer director priyadarshan not a little priyadarshan also takes false credit for inventing the story the basic premise of the plot is stolen from the 1960 play boeing boeing the original author of that work marc camoletti is credited nowhere at least priyadarshan changed the title for this remake rather than brazenly using the original without giving credit as he did in his 1985 version of this same tale according to imdb's credits list
<START> i have seen this movie and even though i kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning i still liked watching it i would recommend it to other people it comes on lifetime movie network quite a lot and i am thinking since it's close to halloween they might play it more so please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it i believe that alicia silverstone played her part very well i really like her as an actress and person she seems so nice and down to earth kevin dillon he's performance was so so for me i am not trying to knock him or anything but i believe that his brother matt would have been able to pull this bad evil serial killer persona better kevin just seems too sweet for me but i think he did okay
<START> i really enjoyed the performances of the main cast emma lung is courageous and interesting the director has developed performances where the characters are not one dimensional a complex story with the changing between eras also appreciated the underlying story of the unions losing power and the effect of a large employer closing on a small town i do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive there have be many relationships with older men and younger women without the male being good looking depth of character can be appealing to the not so shallow the film has a good look and the cinematography is also good
<START> this film is scary because you can find yourself relating to ideas they have and can recall other people saying and having simialr ideas make this a haunting well done movie the camra style is not shakey to point it draws you out of film like blair witch it only adds to the raw real feeling of the film that makes it
<START> final score who cares it's a reality show it has no love for it's audience it panders to lazy tv viewers puts nothing in and gets nothing out br br joe millionaire the most blatantly phony reality show of them all is a television disaster of epic proportions it's a watershed rock bottom moment not only for fox but for the american viewing public who actually watch like and talked about this crap the next day you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves because as much as fox promotes this junk it won't make any money unless it's watch by people and boy was it the finale got nearly super bowl numbers it doesn't bother you people that there are many quality shows written directed acted and generally have effort put into them that are being cancelled while you sit back and lap up this effortless cold game show br br i used to be a staunch supporter of fox it's those of us like me who like and seek out quality tv that helped build fox back in the days of married with children and the simpsons conveniently enough now neither of those shows would make it 6 weeks with the current management the gail berman reign of terror as it's often called the network has waged war on scripted tv and strangely enough it's fans the very people who helped build them in the beginning now not only do we have to fight for good shows but we have to fight against their own network it boggles the mind nothing fox has done in the past 3 years makes any sense from canceling hits like titus futurama and john doe nbc can renew boomtown but fox can't lift it's pitiful head to give the only decent show they had this season another shot and the reason they can do all this the success of junk like joe millionaire they can now say we don't need you tv fans we have reality shows they apparently seem to have no idea that the big audience the draw with this junk is fickle and will abandon them the second the next fad comes along to alienate their base like this will eventually kill the network the way it has set back abc br br the show itself is a joke here we have a premise in the now classic fox gimmick that promises us something different and edgy but then delivers something not in any way different from the bachelor or anything on the big 3 fox has gone mainstream the finale and twist quote unquote showed they have no ideas up their sleeve now we know that all these shows no matter how different they look will all end up the same cornball fairy tale ending we got to see a bunch of lame aspiring actors that the network picked out of millions of head shots to fit their demographics parade around like high school bimbos pretending they liked this evan marriott because well because it was a competition and that's what you're supposed to do marriott himself is like a hideously disfigured chro magnum man who struggles to put together the simplest sentences but how can the women all average to ugly looking by the way an important minus is a guilty pleasure show like this not fall for joe with such charming lines like look you're not stupid br br i used to think that people who watched these reality dating game shows were just to lazy to change the channel but after joe millionaire i think they must be genuinely mentally deficient come on people have a little more pride in yourselves demand a little bit more from your entertainment then this br br boycott fox
<START> go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of andy goldsworthy's sculptures and treat yourself to a thoroughly eye opening and relaxing experience the music perfectly complements the footage but never draws attention towards itself some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot but consider this why would you expand on this in a movie if you can read andy's musings at length in his books or attend one of his excellent lectures this medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artist's works and is used expertly in this respect
<START> i really didn't expect much from this movie but it wasn't bad actually it was quite good this movie contained a couple of the funniest bits of writing i have ever seen from a motion picture now am not saying this is one of the funniest movies of all time but i laughed pretty hard at some parts the police ruled my father's death a suicide they said he fell down an elevator shaft onto some bullets now this movie is not for everybody its mostly stupid humor like zoolander or dodgeball so if you hated these movies i would probably recommend you to steer clear overall it was an enjoyable movie about a group of superhero wannabes who end up becoming real heroes in the end it's a vastly overrated comedy that many people probably haven't seen yet because like me before viewing it expected it to be utter garbage after viewing this film i finally understand why this movie was able to assemble such a superstar cast which includes ben stiller william h macy hank azaria and even that kid from good burger it's because mystery man is full of excellent comedic writing period 7 out of 10 a very big surprise
<START> my girlfriend has the habit of going to blockbuster and choosing movies no one has ever heard anything about admittedly at times it has led to some fun discoveries often times the best that can be said is they definitely run an hour and a half br br she brought home advice from a caterpillar she was excited because the box said it was funny lucky for us the propaganda on the boxes never lie br br this movie was an exercise in patience this is one of those movies where unless you are a pretentious and shallow person who likes watching movies about yourself you will hate every character in the movie until the introduction of the one nice character which the lead annoying pretentious character will fall in love with and act in such a way that in the real world would drive anyone away br br mild spoilers from here on br br so a bunch of emotionally vapid stuck up pretentious artists swear off love and find success in their careers then they meet a nice intelligent emotionally mature and loving character an almost perfect guy we then watch the woman the annoyingly pretentious artist in her 30's freak out as she falls in love so she tries to flee from the nice intelligent emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom she's been having great but empty sex she is rude to the man and does everything in her power to drive him away in the real world she would have been quite successful i certainly wanted to flee from her and i wasn't even in a relationship with her br br although its nice that the man 'fought for his love' i never wanted her to have him nor did my girlfriend she didn't deserve him and why i wonder did the director think that the 'almost perfect guy' should be punished by having to win a relationship with her when the artist was asking the 'almost perfect guy' to leave we were screaming for him to leave too there's a problem with a movie when the heroine of the film is so annoying childish and stupid that you want her to fail br br beyond that let me say that andy dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was also pretentious to the point of annoyance regarding the other characters they were well acted morally bankrupt and annoying characters br br it is a comedy and i can say i did laugh a few times in the film unfortunately not much laughing happened until the last 10 minutes or so but by the time i had those laughs i had been praying for the movie to end for far too long i needed to get these vapid characters out of my life br br if you want to watch people you hate struggle with a love for people they don't deserve then this is the movie for you
<START> hmmmm want a little romance with your mystery this has it i think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie but how could the romance be ditched when the story's borrowed from something called a harlequin romance novel whatever the heck that is had the romance been ditched the story might have been a little too weak the mystery here wasn't too bad quite interesting but nothing on the level of mission impossible international espionage oh well i thought mel harris was pretty good her short skirts i think added some sex appeal but this rob stewart guy probably could have been better cast maybe with a more well known tv movie actor the directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on both could have been a little edgier a little darker more adventurous one thing that was great about this was the use of real european locations that could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like budapest possibly a drawback was the director and or cinematographer's choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect not good had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background this was just a tv movie though so they had to add some ummmph to the picture and some of that ummmph came from the scenery overall twasn't really a bad movie i'll tell you what this was absolutely the best canadian hungarian production i have ever seen and the only that i know of i hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made for tv movie giving it a grade of c
<START> after the overrated success of amenabar and balaguero spanish horror movies spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies the result is all in films like el segundo nombre a tv like production bad written but acted and directed even worse i didn't read the ramsey campbell book but i'm sure that the author of the doll who ate its mother didn't have much in common with this terrible production avoid it at any cost unless you're searching for a quiet sleepy night in a fresh movie theater 2 10
<START> i enjoyed this film it was funny cute silly and entertaining had a fine cast and really got hammered by some critics for reasons that i truly don't understand no it wasn't the grapes of wrath or casablanca or even moonstruck but it was an enjoyable film br br julia was excellent playing the psychotic 'man behind the man' the story is a little silly to be sure but it this isn't high drama folks i happened to see a review of the film probably the only good one it got and then ran into it one night when looking for a movie i never heard it was supposed to stink until after i saw it and i'm glad i saw it eventually bought the vhs tape on the bargain pile and i watch it a couple times a year
<START> disappointing film performance of actors is weak sets are fine could have been better the story is also weak battle sequences are awful sounds and quality of film are trashy the history of kazakh people was told very poorly this film should have included more kazakh actors in leading roles and also should have been in kazakh language kuno bekker and jay hernandez are hispanic origins i don't get it since when hispanic people play turkic mongolian people this film is shame of kazakh cinema rustam ibragimbekov disappointed me he is one of the finest filmmakers in the world czekh director is excused since he is not nomadic origin he cannot know true spirit and history of nomads
<START> a spoiler br br what three words can guarantee you a terrible film cheap canadian production the brain fits those words perfectly terrible script idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make this a must for every bad movie fan the horror is hilarious the post production team looks like it gave up what makes the brain admirable is in the second half it actually tries to be good can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke br br it's around christmas time a mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever the day later a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis br br if a cop 's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it who would you believe what begins as funny turns dull and tiring toward the end when the brain tries to be serious a child cannot be frightened by the scary moments the brain is too funny a concept to try and be gritty the psychological research institute is larger than major manufacturing plants our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the worst acting i have seen viewer discretion advised heavily
<START> myself and my groovadelic 20 something pals just can't get enough of this awesome parker posey classic i tried renting this on dvd but can't seem to find it too bad as i'm sure the features would be extra special we all highly recommend this uber cool comedy flickerino for a date or even just a cozy night home alone this would also be the purr fect type of movie to watch with your cat or even throw a party based on like a party girl party just like the one in the movie that the lovable huggable squeezable parker posey goes to at the end oh and be on the lookout for a gripping and hilarious surprise ending move aside the sixth sense you've just been outdone by a way radder movie sorry no offense just calling it like it is take it from an old flick lover comedy just doesn't get better than party girl with parker p feel it yours ronald marie macdougall aka dj cyber rap
<START> this work is a bold look into the mindset of men who find themselves in wheelchairs this film never tries to tone it down cotton candy ize or soft soap the angst confusion and pain of what these guys live with that is its strength i think br br but more so the performances are fantastic with well conceived and delivered dialog which draws you in and makes you feel a part of the experience the characters never attempt to block out the audience from knowing what's on their mind what's in their hearts br br i found it plodding but enjoyable br br it rates a 6 6 10 from br br the fiend
<START> barbara stanwyck plays lily powers she's a waitress for her father's speakeasy in a little crummy mining town he also sells her to men she escapes to new york and literally sleeps her way to the top br br originally i had only seen the 71 minute version but it's pretty extreme for its time nowadays it's pretty tame the movie moves very quickly and has tons of sexual innuendo some of it comes off as pretty silly but fun today it moves so quickly you can easily ignore that most of it could never happen even in 1933 there's nothing classic or monumental about this it's just a quick gleefully dirty little film that's lots of fun it only falls apart at the end with a little moral ending that the censors demanded it comes across as unbelievable and stupid i saw it in a theatre and the audience laughed at it one guy quite rightfully said no way i just saw the uncut 75 minute version which has a different somewhat tragic and much better ending this version was thought to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake i believe this is the only one in release but be aware br br the acting is good stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it way over the top she makes you believe that she enjoys being cruel and sleeping around there are also strong supporting performances from handsome donald cook and george brent also look for a pre stardom john wayne in a hilarious bit as a meek and mild office worker fun dirty and fast i give this a 9
<START> despite loving rita hayworth finding the final few sequences of the film intriguing and being able to appreciate some of the subtler symbolic aspects of the cinematography the lady from shanghai didn't quite work for me i had a problem with most of the performances the script and the overall structure and in a film that's mostly people talking with each other in various situations that's quite a problem the lady from shanghai ended up at a very low c or a 7 for me br br the lady from shanghai is really all about orson welles' character michael o'hara o'hara sees elsa rosalie bannister rita hayworth in central park on a carriage ride and hits on her later he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him o'hara is a seaman from ireland and the globetrotting elsa happens to own a yacht with her husband arthur everett sloane a very famous and powerful california defense attorney they talk o'hara into working for them despite his initial reservations it seems to him and to the audience that elsa is just looking for someone to have an affair with and o'hara doesn't want to get involved br br shortly after going to work on their yacht a strange man george grisby glenn anders who says he's arthur's partner shows up at a port of call and begins stirring up trouble eventually grisby asks o'hara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme foolishly o'hara agrees naturally it gets him into quite a bit of trouble and eventually a number of mysteries are revealed br br maybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that so far i'm not exactly a huge fan of orson welles and here he produces writes directs and consumes most of the screen time i haven't seen anywhere near the majority of welles' work yet but i've tended to like his later films better when he became a bit more campy and performance arty i love f for fake vÃ©ritÃ©s et mensonges 1974 for example and i even kind of like his performance in casino royale 1967 when he bizarrely insisted on being allowed to do magic tricks at a baccarat table but citizen kane 1941 never did much for me despite giving it 3 or 4 chances over the years including about one year ago my rating was a low 7 the same as my current score for the lady from shanghai br br welles' performance and the dialogue he's written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me he's a bit of a motormouth a bit of a boor and a bit monotone he tends to sound like he's reading his performance reminded me of what i've seen of welles' version of moby dick listed on imdb as 1999 but completed in 1971 it can also be seen in orson welles the one man band 1995 where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that he's inherently sublimely dramatic i'm also someone who almost never complains about accents but somehow welles manages to make his irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me too br br as for the other performances i can only say i thought hayworth did an excellent job of course she's gorgeous which doesn't hurt plenty of eye candy here like welles sloane also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to me i never quite bought his character his handicap and so on and anders is simply bizarre where bizarre doesn't seem to fit welles often shoots him in close up and anders almost always has some over exaggerated manic expression on his sweaty face br br structurally the lady from shanghai is very uneven the first 50 minutes or so are extremely bland and soap operatic although the soap opera ministrations tend to be approached from a tortuous oblique once grisby introduces his scheme things pick up a bit and mostly improve as we near the end but by the time the lady from shanghai becomes a crime mystery film it's too little too late and it quickly turns into a courtroom drama before the sudden thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative excellence br br the ending is more action oriented less dialogue heavy more varied and exotic in settings and at times fairly abstract welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director if the lady from shanghai would have been a largely a combination of the crime mystery stuff and the arty ending it could have easily been at least a 9 the final scenes are easily 10s as welles shifts from a hitchcockian suspense scene in a san francisco chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a chinese amusement park the funhouse climax uses cinematography that was experimental for its time it's well integrated with the script as it allows a complex resolution and fuels a lot of symbolism br br the cinematography throughout is interesting even if it usually can't make up for the problems in the foreground welles blocks scenes with skill there are lots of attractively filmed settings from central park to acapulco to various san francisco locations welles effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his action from the emphasized heights and precipitous drops of acapulco to the maze like caribbean streets the beautifully framed and silhouetted shots of the san francisco aquarium and so on the romance material for which the aquarium serves as one backdrop is interestingly tempered with a kind of unease throughout the film but on the other hand that makes the romance never quite work as romance br br surely serious welles fans will appreciate the lady from shanghai much more than i did and of course it's worth a watch if you love rita hayworth the lady from shanghai isn't exactly a terrible film in my view but it's dangerously close to not passing proceed with caution
<START> you'd better choose paul verhoeven's even if you have watched it
