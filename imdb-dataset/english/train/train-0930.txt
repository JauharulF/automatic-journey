<START> kings and queen is a bloated french drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty two minutes to no discernible point or purpose br br the film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie the first centers around nora and her struggles with various men in her life including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live the other story involves a young man named ismael a violinist who finds himself placed unfairly he believes in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party after traveling along on separate tracks for awhile these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that ismael is a former lover of nora's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier tragic relationship br br with a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining kings and queen might have been a potent engrossing drama about modern day relationships it certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power and the performances are for the most part complex and touching but taken as a whole the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that quite frankly it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on even more distressing is the fact that even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people we really don't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over for instance nora's father on his deathbed writes a withering diatribe against his daughter's character that simply doesn't gibe with the woman we've been looking at for well over two hours nora is admittedly no mother theresa then again who is but she certainly doesn't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father nora could be accused of being confused indecisive a bit self absorbed at times but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place i don't think so br br perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that i was unable to fathom but my suspicion is that even writer roger bohbot and co writer director arnaud desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here this is a well acted pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning
<START> it's just breathtaking in it's awfulness you really must see it br br depending on your perspective dylan walsh is either the savior or the problem here since he's the only one on screen that can actually get his lines out with something akin to natural cadences and inflection he either ruins the movie by pointing up everyone else's flaws or he saves it by providing some context for their awfulness br br i'm inclined to the later view thanks to him it works as high comedy he's the 7 footer in a game of dwarf basketball his skill set just doesn't apply in this context and his discombobulation is delicious br br the real treat though is ms eastwood whose inability to speak in plain english is so pervasive i actually googled her expecting to learn that she was a russian beauty who pronounced her lines phonetically with no understanding of their meaning but no she's just a talent free american who will leave you laughing with every line she drops whether she knew what the lines meant must remain an open question
<START> i ended up watching this movie before even going through any of the reviews on the request of a female just out of curiosity i thought let me find out if there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie i am quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this website that makes me conclude that it's a scam br br as far as my opinion goes i have to ask are these filmmakers retarded or do they assume that the viewers are retarded the movie is atrocious on so many levels and i'm not even talking about the story or presentation br br so these bunch of guys plus one girl the lead actress form a music band guessing from the constant presence of guitars it is supposed to be a rock band hell when did dancers started becoming the part of a rock band anyway let me accept it as the bollywood version of a rock band but amusingly enough all the scores which actually had these two guitarists doing all kinds of cool rock gestures and i am assuming they were playing the instruments the sound of the guitar was completely missing i simply can't comprehend the magnitude of stupidity here br br i am just going to conclude here because it is absolutely not worth pointing out any further flaws in the movie bollywood directors seem to have no shame anymore
<START> the jist see something else br br this film was highly rated by gene siskel but after watching it i can't figure out why the film is definitely original and different it even has interesting dialogue at times some cool moments and a creepy noir feel but it just isn't entertaining it also doesn't make a whole lot of sense in plot but especially in character motivations i don't know anyone that behaves like these characters do br br this is a difficult movie to take on i suggest you don't accept the challenge
<START> once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent reuniting with some former co stars to clean up the town br br low key often to the point of blandness action comedy mostly just doesn't work part of the problem is the casting chris klien as a former action hero he's not bad but he's really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy as i said he's not bad he's just just miscast for what his back story is the real problem here is the combination of the script which really isn't funny and seems artificial at times and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness there is no life in the way things are set up its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list it makes for an un engaging film and yet the film occasionally springs to life such as the in the final show down that ends the film that sequence works but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power br br i can't really recommend the film its worth a shot if you're a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms but otherwise this is just a disappointment
<START> clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes salaam e ishq is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from india that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love which is at least four tales too many in my estimation br br filmed like a cross between an mtv music video and a super bowl beer commercial the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings dazzling colors sexy showgirls high stepping song and dance numbers dream and fantasy sequences winking character asides corny dialogue and way over the top comical performances all pretty much standard issue stuff when it comes to bollywood happenings these days it's an exhausting chore just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance prance and preen their way through the incomprehensible storyline br br there's plenty for the viewer to feast his eyes on here not least of all all the drop dead gorgeous women but he'll need the patience of job to get him all the way through it
<START> back in my high school days in salina kansas they filmed something called the brave young men of weinberg locally and the film crews were rather prominent for weeks eventually we learned that the film was up the academy and was a bit ummm lower brow than we had been led to believe br br i had to see it since i was there and the local audiences seemed less than pleased at the showing i was 17 and thought it was a rather artless attempt at a post animal house type of comedy right down to the fart jokes br br watched it many times since and my opinion has mellowed a bit it's dumb but at times it catches a bit of the mad magazine humor at least as well as most mad tv ron liebman might hate it but he is nearly perfect and unforgettable for me my favorite moment would have been a brief scene on santa fe avenue where i had parked my car while i was buying some guitar strings too bad my pinto's brief appearance usually seems to get cut for tv haven't seen the new dvd but if my old pinto is visible they've got a sale
<START> hands down the worst movie i have ever seen i thought nothing would ever dethrone last action hero but this does easily the movie is about 3 single guys who meet on sundays to discuss their sexual escapades from the weekend a fourth guy who is married and that used to be a part of the group shows up and talks about what he and his wife do nothing works in this movie the jokes are not funny but they are repeated throughout the movie the big kicker at the end of the movie is laughable avoid at all costs
<START> first off let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie this entire movie had to have been a dare you know like 'dude i bet you couldn't make the worst movie ever' with this movie they've made a good effort at achieving that title the effects are of course poor the plot dialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every b horror movie ever made the actors i'm assuming are supposed to be in college yet parts of it especially at the beginning make it seem like they're supposed to be in high or middle school it makes no sense the scarecrow going around killing people isn't the least bit enjoyable spoiler at the end when they chant lester's name and he reappears the black guy and scarecrow are both laughing probably out of relief they were on their last scene and at the cheesy dialogue
<START> the bourne ultimatum is the third and final outing for super spy jason bourne a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer the bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics ultimatum has an 85 100 on metacritic com meaning it's status is universal acclaim and for good reason the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing br br first i highly advise you watch the bourne identity and the bourne supremacy the two fancy titled prequels to ultimatum there may be three different movies but in reality they are all a continuance of one another missing one leaves you stranded and confused just like i was you will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of ultimatum if you missed the first two but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion br br if you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie you probably had a treat watching bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from supremacy jason bourne is played very well by mattÂdamon damon does nothing to deserve an oscar nod but his work here is good enough to hold it's own bourne's adventures take place in many different cities the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times the agency tracking bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down br br i won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies however it wouldn't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience not every viewer is a die hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development ultimatum wouldn't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front br br it seems most people agree that ultimatum was a success of a film the movie opened to 69 million and box office total now is up to 216 mil is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since august 3 it's the best action movie i've seen since live free or die hard br br good damon is solid but not spectacular very smart movie bad story is like many others
<START> its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one but for me tears of kali is one of the horror highlights of the 00's and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece an anthology horror it takes on the story of the fictional taylor eriksson group a cult of sorts based in india whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche with unpleasant results that echo down the years with bookend segments set in india the film is made chiefly of three stories set in germany illustrating the aftermath of the work of the taylor eriksson group with some pretty nasty gore at times its an interesting set up as these things go but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals dark forces unbound by time place or even personality good examples of this are found in the first story especially dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital previous to this story we have seen lars eriksson and notably his wonky lazy eye we also see him healing or at least comforting a patient the lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as eriksson healing a fellow patient also as she wraps up the canvases from the art class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen a face with lazy eye like erikssons there are also references to folk in minuscule roles extras and walk ons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and able to almost infect others there is more to the film philosophically than just evil within it is a film about death suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect at least from the research that i did on wikipedia writer director andreas marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for his skill in constructing the film as well as being thoughtful the film is pretty chilling too the soundtrack of bharti india and panama john has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances michael balaun as a sinister doctor and cora chilcot as a freaky patient especially good the third story also has a fine turn from veteran mathieu carriÃ¨re as a faith healer the biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well so the film isn't quite as gripping as it might be the acting occasionally off and the pacing too but mostly i thought it was pretty great if a shade short of its possible brilliance well worth a look for adventurous horror fans i think
<START> despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential set as a prequel to the original star trek series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer rick berman who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a star trek series could be which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint the actual show runner brannon braga didn't help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise's internal mythology it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck never have i seen a series' that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors jolene blaylock excepted last so long it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience even a trekker audience is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires unfortunately it appears as if berman and braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at paramount that enterprise suffered from franchise fatigue and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they the audience will come br br simply put in a teevee universe where we are given shows like battlestar galactica and the shield the powers that be must give the viewing public a star trek that measures up and is dramatically competitive it is just that straightforward and easy
<START> alive br br alive is a very entertaining sci fi movie from japan i have noticed a lot of disappointed film geeks who loved versus this director's debut film or his third film azumi i have heard they are blood drenched films with swords and zombies and all kinds of goodies frankly i went to the video store to get versus but i am just fine with alive br br if you are looking for beginning to end wall to wall action then alive is not your pick there is plenty of action however it comes as pay off for a whole hour of character driven build up personally i think it is well done and worth it br br of course some of the plot is silly as with many sci fi action films and i think the subtitles using the term foreign object could have replaced with parasite for greater effect this film is brutal when it needs to be so faint of heart need not apply br br they kept the budget down by for the most part confining all the action to one underground building taking a cue from the cube but the film doesn't suffer for it another bonus for this film is intense gothic imagines that are done with great artistic flair during the many flashbacks and dream sequences br br rent this
<START> witchy hildegard knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted disgusting ways i thought i'd seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire hildy is quite the prankster too she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shut then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire witchery made me sick it made my eyes hurt i was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever ever ever made by otherwise competent people until the finale i have to admit i loved the ending it involves a boy and his toy tape recorder cornered by linda blair looking fantastically possessed the scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie's over but you know that old saying if you've got a great ending people will forgive you for just about anything
<START> the minute you give an 'art film' 1 10 you have people baying for your ignorant half ass ed artistically retarded blood i won't try and justify how i am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the 'art house cinema' i have liked or mentioning how i gave some unknown 'cult classic' a 10 10 all i ask is that someone explain to me the point purpose and message of this film br br here is how i would summarize the film opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co incidence this followed by in a nutshell to save you 3 hours of pain the following a children's game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke addicted daughter who he may or may not have raped when she was a child and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues while the game show's star contestant decides that he doesn't want to be a failed child prodigy a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for 'corrective oral surgery' while the game show's producer himself dying of lung cancer asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru even as mr producer's second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man and oh eventually it rains frogs you read correctly and i am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than possibly to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a 'modern epic' br br you are probably thinking that i could have done a better job of summarizing the movie and in turn of not confusing you if i had written the damn thing a little more coherently maybe in a few sentences instead of just one well now you know how i feel
<START> this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen but i really can't recall when i've seen a worse one i thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation what it really was is a soap opera and a bad one at that they overplayed the 'conflict' card to the extreme the first hour or so seems like a shouting match with some implausible scenes thrown in br br possible spoiler br br the 40 or so minute 'memorial' scene with requisite black umbrellas and rain to fictitious crash victims was lame and i thought it would never end br br avoid this one at all costs unless you revel in 'conflict' br br
<START> i did not like chandni bar from the same director br br i did not watch his other movies they came and went br br but page 3 is nicely made seems real like satya from rgv did br br the mental sickness of the so called high society is the summary of the movie in the midst of all the sickness its difficult to lead a normal life which the protagonist konkana sen does serious movie not to be watched with children or expecting wives page 3 of newspapers is the usual place for reporting the activities going on in the parties of the rich and elite who indulge in much more filth then what is reported how this page 3 is also a business prospect is shown in the movie event management firms get paid to arrange parties and make a rich but not famous people famous overnight by clicking photographs with the celebrities invited to the party br br the western culture has crept into the high society of mumabi quite deeply the movie shows it boldly no holds barred br br madhur bhandarkar starts a new journey from here
<START> this effort was like a glitzy tv movie i don't recall this ever being released in theaters if so it must've died a quick death watching the dvd in the comfort of our bedroom it was obvious this film was meant for not much more ed lauter an art critic with a greed streak what a fun turn that must've been i haven't seen ed since the longest yard everyone else pretty much acted by the numbers led by baldwin except for pompeo she had zero charisma and seemed to be sleepwalking thru most of the picture pompeo's daughter had one dimension she played every scene like a lovable little puppy slowest line delivery of any 3 year old i've seen yet br br the chase scenes gave my wife and i headaches too much quick cutting and angle bashing if you 're going to shoot a chase scene in barcelona you might want a few wide shots to exploit the beauty of your backdrop right the whole story was pretty implausible and far fetched but hey we liked it better than the life aquatic
<START> deathtrap is not a whodunit it's a who gonna do it to who first it's so hard to describe this movie without giving anything away so i won't mention anything more about the plot as far as acting goes it is cris reeves greatest role as clifford a young playwrite you really see the range in his acting abilities in this movie from exhaling cheeseburgers to downright frightening clifford is such a hard role to play and in the stage production of this i have never seen clifford played well on both ends of the spectrum the actor plays him as a little puppy or a homicidal maniac reeves is the only person i have seen who has the character right all the way through as for michael caine he's well he's michael caine one of the best actors of the last 50 years and in this film as good as he has ever been
<START> i was given the book version of kazaam for my 8th birthday and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie but this time they were wrong at least with the movie it's over soon br br the acting in this is terrible which i expected from a film with shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor he's bullied by neighborhood kids which i don't blame them because he's a little douche bag br br the story is just plain stupid and extremely clichÃ© about a boy who's father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father br br even at 8 years old i thought this was a stupid idea it's a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it's an embarrassment and should have never been made i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks but you should already know just by reading the plot
