<START> two great comedians in a great neil simon movie based on his hit play br br great combination especially when the comedians in question are matthau and burns small wonder why burns won an oscar for this he's as sharp and as funny as ever and matthau is every bit his match if a tad more crotchety br br this is familiar simon territory two old vaudeville partners reunite for a tv special but still can't stand one another after all these years br br it's a delight to watch these two pick at each other their scenes together make this film an absolute delight myself i especially enjoyed the knock knock knock enter scene and if you're a fan of either burns or matthau you'll enjoy it too br br in fact you'll enjoy the whole movie br br ten stars put a little sunshine in your life
<START> when you look at this now and hear all the language in here it's amazing this was rated pg but that's the 1970s rating system for you peter falk spews out the lord's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie yet few people consider that offensive and certainly not the scumbags who make movies nor the people who rate them br br the cast is a clue to how profane this film can be falk peter boyle allen garfield warren oates gena rowlands and paul sorvino aren't exactly actors you wouldn't find in the sound of music br br i like heist movies and a lot of films by director william friedkin but this script doesn't deliver and it just has way too much of the sleazy '70s feel to it visually and audibly for those who loved falk in tv's columbo it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films this is far from the only case
<START> for years i thought this knockabout service comedy was a product of john ford especially with victor mclaglen as one of the leads it certainly has the same rough house humor that ford laces his films with br br to my surprise i learned it was george stevens who actually directed it still i refuse to believe that this film wasn't offered to john ford but he was probably off in monument valley making stagecoach br br victor mclaglen along with cary grant and douglas fairbanks jr play three sergeants in the indian army who have a nice buddy buddy buddy camaraderie going but the old gang is breaking up because fairbanks is engaged to marry joan fontaine not if his two pals can help it aided and abetted by regimental beastie gunga din as played by sam jaffe br br the rudyard kipling poem served as the inspiration for this rko film about barracks life in the british raj the comic playing of the leads is so good that it does overshadow the incredibly racist message of the film not that the makers were racist but this was the assumption of the british there at the time including our leads and gunga din shows this most effectively br br the british took india by increments making deals here and there with local rulers under a weak mogul emperor who was done away with in the middle of the 19th century they ruled very little of india outright that would have been impossible their rule depended on the native troops you see here note that the soldiers cannot rise above the rank of corporal and gunga din is considerably lower in status than that br br note here that the rebels in fact are hindu not moslem there are as many strains of that religion as there are christian sects and this strangling cult was quite real of course to those being strangled they might not have the same view of them as liberators but until india organized its independence movement until the congress party came into being these people were the voice of a free india br br but however you slice it strangling people isn't a nice thing to do and the british had their point here also when i watch gunga din i think of star trek and the reason the prime directive came into being br br cary grant got to play his real cockney self here instead of the urbane cary we're used to seeing fairbanks and mclaglen do very well with roles completely suited to their personalities br br best acting role in the film however is eduard ciannelli as the guru the head of the strangler cult note the fire and passion in his performance he blows everyone else off the screen when he's on br br favorite scene in gunga din is ciannelli exhorting his troops in their mountain temple note how stevens progressively darkens the background around ciannelli until all you see are eyes and teeth like a ghoulish halloween mask haunting frightening and very effective br br it was right after the action of this film in the late nineteenth century that more and more of the british public started to question the underlying assumptions justifying the raj but that's the subject of gandhi br br gunga din is still a great film entertaining and funny it should be shown with a passage to india and gandhi and you can chart how the indian independence movement evolved
<START> the director tries to be quentin tarantino the screenwriters try to be tennessee williams deborah kara unger tries to be faye dunaway the late james coburn tries to be orson welles michael rooker tries to be gene hackman mary tyler moore tries to be faye dunaway older version cameron diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can successfully don't ask about joanna going eric stoltz and james spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff it delivers endless meaningless dialog and very little action br br tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies an art deco church by bruce goff and a lovely sprawling mansion by frank lloyd wright visit tulsa don't watch this movie it doesn't do the location justice
<START> this is one of the best movies to come from bollywood in years certainly the best this year until now indian to the core the panoramic visuals the heart pleasing dialogs and the melodious and soft music make the movie an exceptional one the apt depiction of indianvalues and culture makes the viewer search for his her roots in them and invigorates the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new lease on life br br this movie is for viewers who enjoy a call to their imagination and philosophical senses if you like watching movies to get all your nerves excited through on screen action sex or terror then this movie is not for you because you will find that the movie is not full of 90 degrees twists in it it is as simple a story for a movie as it can get but that's exactly where the art of the movie lies one gets a real life experience and the best thing is this experience is one full of values and hope it is about the positive side of life about the sweet things that god has showered on humans as against the regressive movies that insist on showing dons terrorists and underworlds this is not about things and people that have gone bad it is about the goodness that still persists and that keeps the world running of course every genre of movies is respectable but it takes a lot of courage and talent to come up with a movie that swims against the current and tries to open the eyes of the public to the hidden realities and truths br br having said that here's more br br the movie is the journey of a couple from their engagement to their arranged marriage yes that's right it is an arranged marriage and the couple come to know each other only through their parents and learn to love each other the 6 month gap between engagement and marriage is a long time not full of enticing happenings but one that nurtures the growing love and devotion of the couple to each other they learn together the importance of their relationship and of this invaluable period of their lives and work to strengthen the bonds of marriage but have these been strengthened enough their relationship will face the test of not only time but also fortune will they pass this test that is what vivah is about
<START> i only rented this movie because of promises of william dafoe and robert rodriguez i assumed that upon seeing rr's name on the cover as an actor that this movie would be good it sounds like a movie that rodriguez would of made so if he's going to lend his name to it than it has to be good right wrong wrong wrong by far the worst editing since manos hands of fate the way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore i have no idea how dafoe and rodriguez got involved in this film maybe they owed somebody but they are way to good for this besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and rodriguez didn't even talk so if you wanna see a movie with poor editing poor acting and confusing storyline than be my guest but don't say you weren't warned
<START> live yes but not kicking br br true story some time ago a dutch tv station made an announcement that they were going to air a new reality show a contest rather the main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure for real br br the country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd saying it was appalling immoral what is this world coming to and the like in a way i had to agree br br as the months passed the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not instead of running the country br br the show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead and up to the last moment the country was up in arms the prime minister making speeches every newspaper writing about it everyone in the country holding their breaths and the network pushed on towards a new frontier in television and they definitely succeeded in doing just that they pushed the envelope br br the show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live whilst she would die shortly after br br and then in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax the woman was not ill but all the candidates were there was no kidney auction the whole show that with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions built up for months to a fantastic climax was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major shortages in organ donors the man who founded this particular network himself died of kidney disease br br now this is television leaving everybody far behind in amazement br br don't give me a poorly acted poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a russian roulette show on american tv br br as if br br spoiler as if i'm going to believe they would get this through the fcc as if i'm going to believe this would get through the us supreme court on the basis of free expression as if i'm gonna believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on air br br it's all been done before watch running man with arnold instead at least it had a semi good ending br br spoiler this is an appallingly bad piece of film together with a ridiculous ending so she gets shot in the end is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice don't take my word for it but i would say this leave this one alone and watch a test pattern instead you'll get more quality
<START> i find alan jacobs review very accurate concerning the movie however i had the opportunity to rent the dvd from blockbuster with a commentary from byu's curator motion picture archives james d'arc the then lds prophet heber j grant approved of the movie understanding the deviations from historic content for dramatic expression and telescoping events for example the movie showed joseph smith on trial despite brigham young's great oratory in defense of joseph smith he was convicted anyway then joseph was killed historically joseph smith was never convicted of anything brigham young was in boston when joseph smith was arrested for this particular trial joseph smith and his brother hyrum where both killed before the trial took place
<START> from the first scene you are given clues as to what may be going on here it becomes more and more obvious as the story rolls on the acting is excellent throughout and these actors touch your soul even though i knew what was going to happen i was extremely puzzled by the motive i'm still puzzled as to why ben did what he did we could see in his face second thoughts but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his emotion and feelings it was a very interesting and touching story but it left me confused maybe that was the point of the film i did like the film and wil smith can wrack up another good film choice this guy knows how to entertain an audience
<START> it's so sad that romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows as superficial and brutal as the garcea series or the vacanta mare child plays the difference is that mugur mihÃ¤escu doru octavian dumitru and other such sub artisans never presume to claim their shows as art pintilie who 40 years ago made a very good movie duminicÃ¤ la ora sase followed by another one nice enough reconstituirea tries to declare his film lenghts art works but unfortunately he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression as such niki ardelean offers again a sample of how not this being about its only merit
<START> why such a generic title santa claus so bland and unpredictable movies before that tried to cash in on the holiday spirit most notably 'santa claus conquers the martians' at least was entertaining to watch because of the campiness to it and all the stock footage being used for some reason that seemed happy to me but this movie just screws christmas in the butt and screws the joy of all the kids santa lives in space his enemy is a devil named pitch santa gets help from merlin the magician how random is this well since it was made in mexico then some of you might understand the way of how the film was made i had to admit some of the effects were just wacky for the time it was a all out cluster of madness though despite all the troubles with the movie it still feels like a christmas movie good conquers evil and christmas still plays a part of our hearts of every good girl or boy in the world or possibly universe thanks to santa claus conquers the martians apparently so i think you should give it a try even if it is one of the worst holiday movies of all time though it should put a smile on your face any day
<START> i'll be honest i got this movie so i could make fun of it i mean come on hood of the living dead what other reaction could i have the thing is though the movie and its makers decided that it wasn't going to be made fun of instead it was going to try its best to be a good movie br br and you know what it came awfully close a little less cheese in the incidental music a little more professionalism in the photography the acting the incidentals like the props love the best buy bag well it's not a classic of the zombie movie genre but it's still a pretty neat little movie on its own and the acting writing and pacing are all surprisingly better than i would have expected there's even some decent humor as two of our leads debate how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead br br if you can overlook the low budget which leaves its fingerprints in everything alas and the almost constant profanity this can be a pretty fun time at the movies no it ain't great yes it could have been better but the makers the actors the crew they all tried to make a good film instead of a camp classic and that counts for a lot the line of campy zombie films is a mile long and thank you guys for not adding to it br br kudos to the quiroz brothers i'd love to see what they do next and hey somebody give them a budget
<START> tenants two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty apartment house they at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build br br this is based upon a bernard malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel very little of the dialog is natural its purple and brimming with shades of meaning its as if a college english major with a head full of pretensions wrote the script it's awful and i found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom snoop dog on down are fine form unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premise br br i can't really recommend this movie while not really bad its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away i lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end if you're interested i'd try it on cable but i wouldn't lay out good money to see it
<START> there were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies but this film certainly isn't one of them it's a shame the child isn't better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes we have the idea of a vengeful child which worked so well in classic films such as the bad seed and then we have the central zombie theme which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie the plot is basically this young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge as you do this is all well and good except for the fact that it's boring nothing happens for most of the film and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore it's not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it the film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish there's really not much i can say about the film overall as there isn't much to it the child is a dismal seventies horror flick and i certainly don't recommend it
<START> a mess of genres but it's mainly based on stephen chow's genre mash ups for it's inspiration there's magic kung fu college romance sports gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping the production is excellent and the pacing is fast so it's easy to get past the many flaws in this film br br a baby is abandoned next to a basketball court a homeless man brings him to a shaolin monastery that's in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but can't read the old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual the school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks the new master gets mad at the now 20 year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the master's weak punches and throws him out for the night the boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangster's club to play darts this leads to a big fight the boy's expulsion from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation br br al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie the man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over the plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film i'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end the effects photography and stunt work are all top notch and make up for the uninspired plot br br stephen chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but that's not a good reason to ignore it it's quite entertaining even with a scatter shot ending recommended
<START> there's no romance or other side plot to this movie it's action and intrigue all the way making it a real man's kung fu movie br br an aging master dispatches his last disciple yan tieh to stop his five former pupils who's styles represents five venomous animals centipede snake scorpion lizard and the toad despite the word venom in the title none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents yan tieh told by his teacher that he's no match for the five former pupil must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four how yan tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story with good kung fu action spread out throughout the story br br recognized as a cult classic this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung fu action movies it's known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story br br it's no artistic masterpiece with the usual bad dubbing and corny acting but the movie is one of the best of its kind because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung fu action movie of its time and gives an extra concentrated dose of them br br one movie you must watch if you are a kung fu movie fan
<START> raising victor vargas is one of those light family movies that you can watch and do the n y times crossword puzzle at the same time and if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a corona you don't have to pause the dvd just let it roll 'cause you won't be missing anything really important no twists turns or tension it's not really an ethnic movie it's a movie about a poor struggling immigrant family that happens to be latino they could have been any ethnic group it made very little difference i've seen it all a zillion times before just plug in a jewish family an italian family a black family or an irish family just the accents and names were different if the vargas family was named bush or clinton and were presbyterians the movie would have been a total snooze br br it's funny that the critics here couldn't get the locale straight some said it was spanish harlem some the bronx and another brooklyn as a life long new yorker i vote for the lower east side and it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other latinos they lived in an insulated isolated little enclave some interaction with non latinos might have created some excitement interest or tension remember west side story br br and now for the oft criticized cinematography i don't know if it was my tv or what but all the indoor shots looked very orange to me the apt the furniture and the faces were all orange what was that supposed to mean and the apt did look pretty cramped to me somebody here mentioned that the old apt's tenements had very big rooms well maybe 50 years ago what landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them br br and another annoying thing this is the second family movie i've seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy jerking off is this private sex act necessary for us to watch please spare me what's up with these directors br br so victor vargas is a pleasant little movie it was nice for a change to see young latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents which they did but the writers let them down giving them a flat unspectacular script to work with enjoy the show but keep your fingers near the fast forward button
<START> warning possible spoilers but not really keep reading ahhh there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i won't have room to list them all the opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills an enchanting peres 'prez' prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited but his grunts are unmistakable and no one else did them and with familiar cast names including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts 1 2 plus teri hatcher from tv's superman br br every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors actresses and producers in daytime tv peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old fashioned delicious farce robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine but feels like a gift to us in the audience some of the cliched characters are a bit dim but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy especially against celeste talbert sally field who is the show's perennial award winning lead nicknamed america's sweetheart the daytime emmies like awards opening does introduce us to celeste's show the sun also sets against all vain fears to the contrary celeste wins again she is overjoyed because it's always such a genuine thrill adam did you watch i won well nguh the reason for adam's absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot and we're instantly off on a trip with celeste's neuroses she cries screeches and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser tawnee kathy najimi constantly waddling after celeste unseen through celeste's fog of paranoia indulges a taste for tammy faye baker for which tawnee had been in fact specifically hired br br rosie schwartz whoopi goldberg has seen it all before she is the head writer of the show and she and celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for 15 years so when celeste freaks rosie offers to write her off the show for six months we'll just say that maggie went to visit with the dalai lama but celeste has doubts i thought that the dalai lama moved to la well then some other lama fernando lamas come on such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor lorenzo lamas son of aforementioned fernando lamas d 1982 br br those who can remember the economics teacher ben stein in ferris bueller's day off 1986 as he deadeningly calls the roll bueller bueller bueller will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer other well hidden member of the cast include garry marshall in real life mr happy days and brother of penny who gets paid 1 2 million to make the command decisions on the sun also sets he says he definitely likes peppy and cheap and carrie fisher as betsy faye sharon who's a bitch br br geoffrey anderson kevin kline is the yummy with a spoon and he is by the way dinner theater actor now rescued from his hell by david seaton barnes robert downey jr and brought back to the same show he was canned from 20 years earlier of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character rod randall was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago somehow they work out the logical difficulties and geoffrey anderson steps off the choo choo br br celeste can now only get worse and her trick of going across the washington bridge no longer helps first her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara but she soon degenerates into a stalker unfortunately she cannot get rid of geoffrey anderson so easily geoffrey's been promised development of his one man play about hamlet and he means to hold the producer to that promise i'm not going back to florida no how argues geoffrey you try playing willie loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf and indeed seeing geoffrey's dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious back in florida in his willie loman fat suit in his room geoffrey anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as mr loman he was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his tv with a shoe and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating laurie craven the show's new ingenue so he's not leaving br br beautiful elizabeth shue as laurie rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well but of course the course to true love never did run smoothly montana moorehead cathy moriarty is getting impatient waiting for her star to rise and is getting desperate for some publicity br br will her plots finally succeed will celeste settle her nerves or will she kill tawnee first will the producer get mr fuzzy you'll just have to watch the second half of this utterly lovable farcically malicious riot br br and you'll really have to see to believe how the short sighted geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the teleprompter if you are not in stitches with stomach heaving laughter and tears pouring down your face feel free to demand your money back for the video rental soapdish 1991 is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again because it's not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines this is very well crafted humor almost all of it in the writing a draw with blazing saddles 1974 for uproarious apoplexy value although otherwise dissimilar watch it and weep a happy source for anyone's video addiction 10 out of 10
<START> the plot certainly seemed interesting enough how can a real life brutal murder be turned into a truly boring movie well you can watch wonderland and find out br br i had heard of the wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely sadistic people unfortunately there is zero character development so we never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters the pace of the direction was very tedious this all leads to an extraordinarily boring movie br br given that dawn schiller a central character as holmes's girlfriend was an associate producer and that holmes's wife was a consultant on the film we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters
<START> as a southern baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly aren't so many that i want to discourage film makers from a genre that's woefully under exploited still i must honestly say that love's abiding joy is a typically low budget low key self consciously christian film the plot is predictable the acting mediocre i'm being kind and the editing atrocious as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired keep trying guys you've got to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k chesterton or c s lewis for some inspiration
