<START> for the longest time i liked this movie better than the original care bears movie well last summer i watched them both together and decided i was wrong the first one is a better care bears movie as you may have guessed if you read my review for it this one isn't a bad movie it's just very strange br br well first of all as a few people have mentioned it completely disavows any knowledge of the first movie i can't think of another sequel that contradicts the original so blatantly especially with the genders of some characters and how they all met when i was little and watching this i was quite a bit confused and distraught i felt the same way watching it as an adult br br on to the reasons why the movie is actually pretty good if you disassociate it from the first movie i can't think of another movie for little kids with a demon as it's villan now i am not for a minute suggesting that evil demons who want to steal the souls of campers and care bears are good i just find it cool that there's a supremely evil being in a movie for little kids it's like that bizzare santa clause vs satan movie from mexico you hear about sometimes br br anyhow the demon's name is darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get the care bears in return for him giving her special powers very dark for a kiddy flick eh and did i mention that darkheart appears to the girl most often as a whiney voiced 10 year old boy freaky meanwhile some other kids are in care a lot looking after baby care bears oh man demons and baby care bears in the same movie br br needless to say everything gets cleared up in the end but not before we get to see darkheart trap the care bears' souls in this scary chandelere thing in one surprisingly deeply disturbing scene but i am left with the question of wether this movie has found the cult audience it so richly deserves i might just watch it again myself
<START> this is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made the stage version of a chorus line is wonderful this movie misses the mark in almost every way even the casting is baffling take audrey landers as val dance 10 looks 3 is val's song val's story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department yes she finds a solution but ultimately she's a great dancer what do the brilliant filmmakers do they hire an actress who can't dance and is famous for looking great way to miss the boat br br then there's the choreography i'm sure michael bennett was turning over in his grave why didn't they use his choreography it really can't be improved upon
<START> as a cinema fan white noise was an utter disappointment as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good nicely lit good camera work reasonable direction but as a film it just seamed as predictable as all the other 'so called' horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with although it did have a little bit of the 'chill factor' the whole concept of the e v o electronic voice phenomena did'not seem believable this movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them the acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion like many recent thriller horror movies br br definitely not a movie i will be buying on dvd and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it
<START> i remember devil dog playing on tbs almost 20 years ago and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day it's not that bad for a made for tv horror movie but it is derivative mostly of the exorcist and businesslike for lack of a better word it won't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting but it's not a waste of time either it's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard br br however if you go into the movie looking for some laughs you won't be disappointed the early scenes with lucky the devil dog as a cute little puppy with children of the damned eyes are hilariously non threatening and the climactic blue screen effects of a giant black dog with horns are pretty side splitting and keep an eye out for the cloaked satanist in maverick shades toward the beginning br br not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination but i wish they still made stuff like this for tv
<START> a very promising directorial debut for bill paxton a very dark thriller who really done it recommended by stephen king this is a strong well conceived horror tale about a devout but demented man in thurman texas that goes on a murdering spree after getting orders from god to eliminate demons trying to control mankind a couple of plot twists and an eerie finale makes for your moneys worth most of the violence you don't really see but still enough to double up your stomach br br director paxton plays the twisted man to be known as the hand of god killer matthew mcconaughey is equally impressive as the demented man's eldest son that ends up telling this story to a dallas fbi agent powers boothe boothe as always is solid and flawless suspenseful white knuckler highly recommended
<START> my husband rented this from a video store thinking it was suspense he never reads the synopsis br br well it would be funny if the thing was watchable it simply isn't the same thing over and over no intrigue and where did they find the leading man the leading man michael des barres is not even feasibly good looking especially for this role he is given also sexual harassment at work is something if you want to see rent michael crichton's disclosure at least michael douglas looked good in the early 90's br br alexandra paul who is usually watchable plays an embarrassing scene here there are also lighting effects cheaper than your at home web cam don't even waste time renting this 0 10
<START> i grew up with this as my all time favorite film the special effects are incredible for the era and won awards i can remember the dialogue as if i'd heard it yesterday it is simply a great timeless adventure the music is by miklos rosza who is cinema history's best sabu is the thief conrad veidt is the grand villain i have a copy within reach for the next trip down memory lane whoa there rex ingram wants out of his genii bottle
<START> preston waters is off to a bad summer besides his birthday coming up nothing else looks promising br br first he has to share his own room with his brothers who are going to run a business they can't do it in their rooms because they don't have enough space off to a birthday party he only gets 6 tokens while others get 32 35 and even 50 when one of his birthday cards comes early he only gets a check made out for 11 br br going to the bank he learns he needs 200 at least to start an account leaving the bank a bully steals the check pursuing after the kid nearly gets him run over definately his bike gets ruined by a criminal named quigley played by miguel ferrer quigley's just come from the bank too from giving the owner 1 000 000 to give to this guy tomorrow quigley starts to write a check for the damage but only succeeds in writing his name before a police car circles the area afraid he gives preston the check informs him to give it to his dad to finish out br br that evening though preston tells his dad that he doesn't want a new bike he wants his own room back better yet his own house his father confines him to his room for the rest of the evening moping in his room preston figures things can't get any worse he realizes that he forgot about the check as it's still in his shirt pocket it's blank br br using the computer and after careful consideration he makes it out for 1 000 000 the next day while trying to cash it at the bank he's taken to the owner who thinks he's the person he's supposed to give the 1 000 000 and does he's not though as the real person named juice comes in a moment later br br now the three have to track preston down br br meanwhile preston has fun buying all sorts of stuff including his own house and even going on dates with a disguised bank lady who's really and fbi agent who's trying to track the 3 bad guys down he makes this person up named mr macintosh who he works for and even plans a party for him on his birthday br br but eventually things catch up the money runs out the bad guys get him br br overall a pretty funny flick miguel ferrer plays his role very good if you enjoyed him in another stakeout you'll love him here he does all sorts of wicked crazy things br br rick ducommun the stressed out boss from ghost in the machine plays a wonderful friendly chauffeur in this movie
<START> what's with all the negative comments after having seen this film for the first time tonight i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person's day when i saw that drew ben affleck might end up spending the holidays alone i wanted to cry you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why also even though i liked tom james gandolfini and alicia christina applegate after awhile if you ask me they were real snobs however this film did make me smile and feel good inside before i wrap this up i'd like to say that mike mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit now in conclusion i highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person's day to any ben affleck or christina applegate fan who hasn't seen it
<START> this is what makes me proud to be british this is by far the funniest thing on tv the league consists of jeremy dyson steve pemberton mark gatiss and the lovely reece shearsmith totally underrated this horror comedy is perfection the characters are iconic and the catchphrases bizarre hello dave it is a comedy that everyone simply must watch br br the best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it is always fresh and always pushing the boundaries it does not need to rely on catchphrases unlike little britain for it to be funny the fact that the league are willing to kill off arguably their most famous and iconic characters shows us that they've got balls of steel
<START> i'm so confused i've been a huge seagal fan for 25 years i've seen all of his films and many of those dozens of times i can only describe this film as bizarre steven seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film but i have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines with a thin whiny imposter's voice no less what i also don't get is if they had to dub some of his lines why does his own voice appear on the rest of them i expect seagal to age like the rest of us but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger confidence bravado charm and sex appeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous movies what i found myself missing most of all was his cocky self assured attitude and his bad ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin where is that in your face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star i hope that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us if so his lifelong fans will have to concede that the seagal we all knew and loved is gone
<START> a mummy narrates vignettes about men women and the sex between them huh at the beginning the mummy randomly asks the viewer imagine having sex with this girl imagine having sex with this boy about 37 times while flashing pictures of half naked mod youths later said mods boys pelt mod girls with vegetables if you ignore or fast forward through the mummy's rambling the shorts aren't bad in their own right i found a few of them rather funny my personal favorite is one where the sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard sits on the bed this is one well bizarre movie
<START> i own almost every seagal movie yes even ones like this that are low budget and i must say this may be the worst not only of his movies but of all movies ever made the only highlight of this film and only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that a it is seagal and b seagal does have some sweet action sequences specifically in the store and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife next time give me 90 minutes of seagal killing people and don't even bother with a story line because the storyline not only stunk but so did the acting the fact that f 18's and f 14's somehow changed into f 16s and also the fact that the stealth was as fast as an f 16 also the stealth never had to refuel and since when is afghanistan considered hostile territory from an air force stand point last i checked afghanistan has no air force we usa control the skies also this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room yet the admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret also how did seagal go from the bottom of the truck to the top please tell us why they jailed him since when are air force pilots great commandos unless they are owen wilson and since when are their drunks in arab countries considering muslims don't drink alcohol also on top of that since when do arabs listen to orders from females like the 2 in charge the highlight of the film was definitely seagal killing people in the store and the other 50 people he killed with a knife as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere
<START> i suppose i always felt that hotel du nord was studio bound the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location but no problem it's still a much underrated lovely composition from marcel carne the plot seems a bit choppy at times as if they were making it up as they went along but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end the money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue but it's all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre war france or simply idiots suicide pacts are fairly common if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools br br arletty played the part of prostitute well she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway i've only seen a few films with jouvet he is the most impressive invention as pimp in hdn my trouble is shallow every time i see his face i think of sonnie hale in evergreen br br a remarkably atmospheric well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place annabella and aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple francois heurtebise perier in his 2nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man all in all wonderful
<START> well that's 90 minutes of my life i won't get back this movie makes teen tv show california dreams look like almost famous the acting was horrid and storyline unrealistic don't even get me started on the actual band at the forefront of this story lame songs look etc you had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country and there isn't enough irony in the world to accept that one the guitarist is seen to be a heroin user not that i blame him if i was around such a putrid band with stale songs and wooden acting i'd be injecting the horse too br br if you take music remotely seriously avoid this at all costs
<START> 1999 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray first they sent us to eyes wide shut then they hyped up the blair witch project and now magnolia which is by far the worst movie of the year what is it about who the heck knows its full of self indulgence and loaded with bad acting i always like to stay and watch the credits but when this thing was over i couldn't get out of the movie theatre fast enough most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at felt pretty much the same way dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers it's an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful
<START> i don't give a movie or a show ten very often but this show touched a nerve in a way no other show has i found the entire series on mysoju com and thought the premise looked interesting so i took a look see i wasn't disappointed in what i saw i was moved this story stays on the tender side as the main characters move us through the scenes sumire iwaya played thoughtfully by koyuki shows us human nature as she wants to keep troubles from being shown no one really wants to lay their soul out in front of a perspective mate so instead she substitutes a human played by an adorable matsumoto jun as a pet this pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet the difference he can retaliate in the same way after all momo is a man not a dog as he is treated like a pet he reacts to situations how a dog might react she spends time with the new boyfriend momo gets jealous it's when she realizes that her pet isn't just a pet that the sexual tension between the two starts to become thick momo is a dance prodigy her thinking slowly changes as we start to get a glance at his own thoughts matsumoto takes us from seeing a character who is very one dimensional in the beginning to two dimensional when we see he's a dancer to a three dimensional character when we see him start to fall for his master as a man not as a dog in my opinion it's worth watching this story just to see this character develop plus matsumoto plays momo with such tenderness you almost start to wish you had one too neither wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change but as momo the name she gives him as one would name their new puppy states Â we both knew this wasn't going to be able to last watch this show with a open mind it's worth it
<START> as a habit i always like to read through the 'hated it' reviews of any given movie especially one that i'd want to comment on and it's not so much a point counterpoint sorta deal i just like to see what people say on the flipside br br however i do want to address one thing many people that hated it called it to paraphrase 'beautiful but shallow ' some even going so far as to say that norm's desire yet inability to help his brother was a mundane plot at best br br i'd like to disagree br br as a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction i can relate daily you see them abuse themselves knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self destruction and it's not about the specifics of what they did when how or why paul decided to take up gambling and associating with questionable folks it's really more how they are wired on one hand they are veritable geniuses and on the other painfully self destructive it's a lot like people like howard hughes Â the same forces which drive them are the same forces which tear them apart and all the while you see this you know this and what's worse you realize you can't do a damn thing about it br br for norman maclean a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur and who was to blame in the end no one is and often there is no why but it takes a great deal of personal anguish to truly come to this realization sometimes it takes a lifetime and sometimes it never comes at all
<START> it's a genuine shame that this spin off tv series inspired by the superior made for tv pictures the night stalker and the night strangler only lasted a single season and twenty episodes because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor carl kolchak's spirited verbal sparring matches with perpetually irascible and long suffering editor tony vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear clever writing nifty supernatural menaces gotta love the offbeat and original creatures in the spanish moss murders the sentry and horror in the heights plus you can't go wrong with such tried'n'true fright favorites as zombies vampires werewolves and witches colorful characters lively acting from a raft of cool guest stars legendary biker flick icon william smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in the energy eater while other episodes featured great veteran character actors like keenan wynn john fiedler john dehner severn darden and william daniels in juicy roles effective moments of genuine suspense the sewer set climax of the spanish moss murders in particular was truly harrowing and best of all the one and only darren mcgavin in peak zesty form as the brash aggressive and excitable but basically decent brave and honest small time chicago illinois newspaper reporter carl kolchak br br kolchak was the quintessential 70's everyman protagonist a wily and quick witted fellow with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of trouble moreover the occasionally bumbling kolchak was anything but superhuman he usually either tripped or stumbled while running away from a deadly threat yet possessed a certain inner strength and courage that enabled him to save the human race time and time again from all kinds of lethal otherworldly foes kolchak was surrounded by a handful of enjoyable secondary characters simon oakland was perfect as carl's chronically ill tempered boss tony vincenzo jack grinnage as the prissy ron updyke made for an ideal comic foil ruth mcdevitt was simply delightful as the sweet miss emily cowles and carol ann susi was likewise a lot of fun as eager beaver rookie monique marmelstein who alas disappeared after popping up in only three episodes granted the show did suffer from lackluster make up and special effects the titular lycanthrope in the werewolf unfortunately resembles a yorkshire terrier and the latter episodes boasted a few laughably silly monsters the headless motorcyclist in chopper cathy lee crosby as helen of troy in the youth killer' but even the second rate shows are redeemed by the program's trademark wickedly sly sardonic wit and mcgavin's boundless vitality and engagingly scrappy presence
<START> this is the biggest load of crap that i have seen in a long time the last time i hated a movie so much was whilst watching 28 days later and magnolia there is absolutely no point to this movie except to see some really sick and twisted sex rape scenes gillian anderson relieving herself on the side of the road and every single sentence of dialog having to use the f word at least a couple of times in it it has extremely cheap acting and is very low budget my friend and i eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour we had tried to give it a chance but nothing could save this crud do not watch it
