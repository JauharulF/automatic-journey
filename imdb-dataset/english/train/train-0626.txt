<START> this thought long lost flick sometimes comes available on the web so i bought me a copy well of course the acting is terrible and the story line is childish but it does have his moments i think people who searched this one also knows the backstory of it it was made by a grindhouse cinema owner for an extreme low budget but for me he surely didn't spoiled the money on props but on the make up the make up is for that kind of flick well done the zombies are watchable and the gore is intact the only problem with that kind of movies is the quality of the pelicule it's terrible luckely no hiss on the sound but sometimes it's way too dark so you have to watch clearly to see the gore in a funny way they tried to sell this one as really not for the squeamish a voice over tells in the beginning of the movie to watch out for a sign and a man appearing with green flashes that tells you there is gore on the way of course that doesn't work made me think of cannibal girls had that annoying bell when the red stuff started to flow they had the original idea cannibal girls was made a year earlier don't go for the storyline go for the zombies and notice a continuity mistake when the girl and guy are making love first she takes of her bra then they make love and suddenly her underwear is back on try to do that or am i getting a bit offline eat it you ugly corpses
<START> i'm hearing rumors of an upcoming leonard nimoy demonstrates the blu ray disc with advances over the past 25 years ranging from steady cam to cgi it'll be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvigorated i just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left in my mouth by that whole magnavision demonstration fiasco br br and yes leonard nimoy demonstrates the betamax vcr was a brilliant milestone in entertainment history after the tentative leonard nimoy demonstrates the compact cassette and the downright tacky leonard nimoy demonstrates the 8 track tape who would have expected such a glorious piece of cinema i'm weeping right now just thinking about it
<START> we all know that countless duds have graced the 80s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust maybe that's a bit hastey but damn if slaughter high wasn't terribly unoriginal even for a slasher flick pretty much the plot involves a kid who experienced a carrie like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former bullies who all show up to reminisce as you'd expect they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on april 1st by means of electrocution burning hanging and chemically altered beer i've got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie but considering the ending i feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time ignore any thought of viewing this movie
<START> this movie was terrible the first half hour is much like a well apologies for the lack of articulation but it was simply a bad version of a clockwork orange the first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in clockwork supposedly it was a tribute as per the appearance of the clockwork poster on the protagonist's wall however ripoff is the more appropriate word the movie felt as though it was torn right from the kubrick classic only filmed through a new director's eyes a blind director unfortunately when it stops its massacre of kubrick's work the film gets even worse as another commentator said the deepness of this film is just shoved down your throat arrogant self absorbed and ultimately meaningless drivel br br perhaps the protagonists ramblings would touch a nerve if there was any actual character development in this movie i felt absolutely nothing for this guy and i'm an alcoholic so i figure that if anyone might be able to feel anything for him it would be me awful character development dialogue and plot br br the worst part about this movie is the title for a film called 16 years of alcohol the alcoholism is hardly a factor in the flick see first paragraph it was such a butchering of a clockwork orange i can't get over it a more suited title would have been 16 years of violence or even better a clockwork banana br br just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie if you disregard my advice and take it out anyway drink trust me
<START> i'm starting to write this review during a break as i watch the movie it's the first time i've tried doing that but i'm having trouble getting through this one without occasional breaks that's not because it's intense but because it's bad br br it's almost painfully tedious and unbelievable especially when the preternaturally robust dying brother ryan colm feore is on screen being tragic and bitchy self indulgent and self pitying this would have been a much better movie if they'd just left that character out of the story br br he adds nothing but mawkish maudlin very irritating melodrama maybe somebody decided that if they couldn't make ryan believable they'd just make him obnoxious the problem with that is who cares if a spoiled whining obnoxious jerk is dying not me br br the only thing this character has going for him is the fact that he's dying and sorry but that's just not enough dying doesn't make anybody special we're all dying sooner or later it doesn't give anybody the right to expect sympathy while acting like a jerk br br the other two characters and the actors playing them david cubitt as theo and chandra west as sarah are very much more interesting and their story without ryan's self pitying interruptions would have made a much better movie but it's not over yet and it's time to hit play again maybe something great happens before the end br br nope sorry this rented turkey goes back tonight
<START> not to mention easily pierce brosnon's best performance of course greg kinnear is always great really when has he really been bad i think this film is incredibly underrated the use of colors in this movie is something very different in today's film world where every other movie has the payback blue filter i also love the way they used the song by asia proving that even what was once thought of as kinda cheesy can be really cool placed correctly br br i was making my first feature when this came out being that my film was a hit man movie i had to check out anything in the genre that was released after seeing it i'm sure it had some effect on me through the process it was pretty cool when my film got on the imdb that it would recommend this film if you liked mine how any of the others relate i have no idea making an even more interesting coincidence br br http www imdb com title tt1337580
<START> i think i read this someplace joe johnston director of the film and also one of the guys who founded industrial light and magic for work on the first star wars film and one of his producers or something were racking their brains for a title for the movie rocket boys i guess was lacking something br br one day they were messing with a pc program that forms words from other words ie you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words i think the technical term is an anagram br br anyway they typed in rocket boys and sure enough what comes back is october sky they were shocked to say the least the title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around sputnik at first homer jr did not like the idea but he warmed up to it after the movie poster paperback novel came out and took off
<START> right then he's absolutely brilliant but you must be intelligent and quick to understand his humor he covers attacks all sorts of topics such as the first moon landing easter christmas transvestitism movies and herr doktor heimlich br br for those of you are averse to swearing this isn't for you while some of us punctuate with commas and periods he uses the f word also if you can't laugh at yourself never watch this you will feel the fool br br incidentally i've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live and this is by far his best work he simply shines br br what might go so far as to say he is glorious
<START> for the big thinkers among us the intruder is a maddeningly incoherent movie from france that gives so called art films a bad name the story is something about a bitter old coot louis trebor michel subor who goes searching in tahiti for a heart transplant but beyond that i have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing with no coherent storyline to boast of the movie loses us early on though i'm perfectly willing to admit that there might be somebody out there who actually gets some deep message out of this film br br this muddled snail paced drama runs a full two hours and five minutes though i seriously doubt anyone with any kind of a life will still be hanging around by the closing credits
<START> i've seen other guinea pig films like mermaid in a manhole he never dies and while they're pretty sick they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them however dark devil's experiment though is nothing more than filming a bunch of punks submitting a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and there's no plot and no redeeming values to it whatsoever it isn't remotely scary except for perhaps the mind set but it's definitely disgusting and i certainly would not call it entertainment now i'm not the paragon of good taste in films and i like my trash and sleaze but this was too much for me really i'm all for disturbing in fact i seek out things that are disturbing whenever possible but this was a bit much the young woman is kicked beaten submitted to continuous noise via headphones until she drools and then pelted with raw meat and innards and left hanging in a hammock out in the woods somewhere if you think that sounds great go for it but it certainly put me off viewing any more guinea pig stuff 1 out of 10 absolutely nauseating
<START> ok this movie had a terrible premise be serious according to the movie they had just been through an apocalyptic war yet they have money to buy huge robots and pit them against each other each country decides instead of investing into rebuilding their country they would rather fight with robots no one could afford here's a better idea lets rely on our most inept resource jocks to fight our battles br br everyone says what about the director what about him he makes a good movie he makes a bad movie there is no reason to give this movie some credit just because of the director maybe he was asleep i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it was so cheesy and ridiculous i had to laugh i actually had a good time watching it well except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be an assassin trust me no one would see this guy as an assassin so it is a surprise however lame what kind of training exercise is a jungle jim anyway i was sad to see mst3k had not done this one i am giving a two star rating however because nothing could be as bad as manos the hands of fate br br the budget does not matter either i have seen plenty of reasonable movies that had nothing for budgets like cube the storyline was not even plausible and i have seen better acting in school plays surly they could have afforded an eleven year old from any middle school play br br anyway pick it up it is a fun movie to watch
<START> except for acknowledging some nice cinematography i can hardly say anything positive about this movie the single real issue is the protagonist's dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life abundant emotionally powerful scenes do not go with this plot and because of bad acting they also fail to create the intended atmosphere the director only manages to introduce anthony's dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution the characters do not seem to evolve although it is difficult to speak of any characters perhaps except for sonny beside him actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to they come off as self indulging amateurs i wonder what ruined the movie more the superficial script throwing away all the potential of the plot or the bad acting disturbing any appeal that might be left
<START> this review may have spoilers but that determination would be negligible in such a classic and well known story br br the cinderella story ranks as my favorite fairy tale the world will never have enough of this wonderful tale br br the problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale this cannot work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and scrumptious looking production designs with poor direction and editing br br this cinderella story is more like an ugly duckling that never hatches or rather is never transformed into a swan br br all the production value that money can buy cannot purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development or good acting br br the entrance of cinderella at the ball as so poorly done there was no drama of anticipation nor excitement of discovery br br the writing made me very nervous too the prince charming was the most undesirable of memory why would any girl want to marry a boorish self absorbed prince who disliked women br br turner's turn on the stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful showing that demonstrated one liners more than acting nuance br br even the cinderella part held little interest or sympathy br br perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt so cheaply '90's br br what must be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography matte work and production design it was a pleasure to peruse the landscapes sets and settings as the story unfolded br br for some cinderella storytelling go for two gems br br 1 rodgers and hammerstein's cinderella musical with lesley ann warren even with the obvious stagey tv 60's look to the sets this is the best version on celluloid bar none an all star cast makes every effort to provide the highest entertainment engaging diverting and memorable writing and music this is the classic br br 2 ever after this drew barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective alters the story line but not enough to derail the effective development of the salient points of this classic tale the characters of the principals and of all of the supporting roles were written smartly and acted well
<START> i saw this dull waste of time on hbo's comedy channel so i quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy but there is absolutely nothing funny here a good cast is basically wasted on a script that i could have written with my left butt cheek after it had been beaten senseless by 15th century inquisition torturers the first half is particularly bad as it has some of the most dull pointless dialogue i've come across in a while and zero comma zero plot to speak of just the fact that stars such as ewan mcgregor and zeta jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site should tell you everything a couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold british coast but that's about it br br this is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections family connections preferably and or plenty of cash lying around
<START> first off to give you some idea of my taste in movies br br 2007 comedies i enjoyed superbad knocked up hot fuzz blades of glory br br 2007 comedies i hated evan almighty the brothers solomon good luck chuck br br i should have followed my first instinct and turned off hot rod after i got to about the 20 minute mark i knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once the script is absolutely brutal i have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack 6 on imdb any one older than 10 years old who enjoyed this must be some kind of mental defective br br this doesn't come close to anything with will farrell and it's clear that andy samberg can't carry anything longer than a 5 to 10 minute sketch on youtube or snl i don't know how they roped ian mcshane and isla fisher into doing this movie they must have owed favors or something i came in knowing that it would be a dumb movie but i thought it would at least be funny i didn't so much as smirk br br i don't normally comment on movies at imdb but this was so awful i just had to warn people this is only the 4th movie i've seen that i've felt compelled to rate 1 10
<START> cinema is the ultimate pervert art it doesn't give you what you desire it tells you how to desire br br so begins the pervert's guide to cinema in which slovenian philosopher and psychoanalyst slavoj zizek applies his freudian lacanian brain scalpel to world cinema this film in three parts is the second feature documentary directed by sophie fiennes yes sister of ralph and joseph and it is a notable accomplishment clocking in at 2 1 2 hours of talk from one man and yet remaining humorous and engaging throughout in essence it is an extended film lecture and one of the best you may ever get over the course of the film zizek guides us through a catalog of obsession and desire in film history he touches on more than 40 films and in particular spends a great deal of time with hitchcock lynch chaplin tarkovsky the marx brothers and eisenstein but he also takes a close look at persona the conversation three colors blue dogville fight club and the exorcist thematically zizek's inquiry into cinema ranges from thoughts on the death drive to the coordinates of desire and from gnosticism to partial objects br br the pervert's guide will be a slightly better experience if you've taken a few minutes to bone up on your basic freudian terminology however even if you're not steeped in psychoanalytic theory zizek's dynamic and hilarious personality carries the film forward with such gusto that you aren't likely to balk at the specialized lingo the film frequently cuts from movie clips to images of zizek inside the movie he is talking about that is in the original locations and sets the transitions in these sequences sustain such tension and humor that the trick never gets old and zizek himself is constantly making us laugh either from bizarre little jokes or from his enthusiastic insistence on for example a bold oedipal interpretation of the birds and this go ahead and laugh attitude on the parts of both fiennes and zizek is essential to the gonzo character of the film it is the spoonful of sugar that helps us digest zizek's weird medicine after all don't we all have a sense that past a certain point psychology theorists are just pulling our legs
<START> the wicker man i am so angry that i cannot write a proper comment about this movie br br the plot was ridiculous thinly tied together and altogether just lame nicolas cage shame on you i assumed that since you were in it that it would be at least decent it was not br br i felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor and even if it's complete the movie was just outlandish and silly br br at the end you're left mouth agape mind befuddled and good taste offended i have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred people were complaining about it in small groups in the mall four floors down from the theater near the entrance it's that bad br br i heard it compared to glitter american werewolf in paris and gigli my boyfriend was so mad he wouldn't even talk about it br br grrrr
<START> this dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent in particular dan aykroyd and howard hesseman are misused badly here i might have chuckled once or twice during this film but in general it's a boring movie with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure the premise although routine still wasn't bad but once the plot was set the film went nowhere don't waste your time with this misfire
<START> i know you've read that before on countless other films no doubt if you're reading the comments here but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film i've been able to track down no doubt the really bad ones aren't even available to buy or watch on tv but even so i feel it's fair to qualify that i'm not just some dumb renter who picked badly br br i've seen two thirds of the bottom 100 ranked films here on the imdb and i'm ticking of the remaining ones with every chance most of those stand head and shoulders above this excersize in absolute monotony br br i like to rate truly bad films as in ones with no humour even in how bad they are by how many people you need to watch it with to make it all the way through if you can watch it by yourself it isn't that bad if you can watch it with one single friend it's bad but could be a lot worse br br it took 5 of us to make it all the way through voodoo academy and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films spotting the boom mic for example 3 times in this one if i'm not mistaken could take away the dry taste in my mouth yes i'd watched it but i'd also forced 4 of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that end br br i hope and pray we saw the directors cut to think that there could be a version with 20 more minutes of big eyebrowed lugs with baby oil glands rubbing their torsos just scares the hell out of me so much of the film centers around this br br i do applaud david decoteau for managing to lens this film in two days on a short budget just as i applaud him for convincing people to pay him to make what is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes but it isn't a good film the original shop of horrors was shot in the same length of time for a comparitive amount of money considering inflation and was an utter gem it's not an excuse for how bad this baby is br br spoilers ahead br br it's not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched know it all hero characters the pacing of the film is insane nothing is interesting for the length of time decoteau dedicates to the pectoral self massaging no matter what your alignment or sex rubbing just cannot sustain that kind of screen time br br the acting is cheese but not overly amatuer i've seen a lot worse in better films but somehow it's the semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines you'll ever hear in a film that really grates br br rent this if like me you have a fascination with the worst of the worst and only if you're going to watch it with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it this is no ha ha ha the set wobbled affair it's an endurance test you probably want to skip br br i'm sure there is worse but i wouldn't be surprised if it has decoteau's name on it
<START> this movie is definately one of my favorite movies in it's kind the interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen it treats themes like duty guilt word manipulation and trust like few films have done and unfortunately none that i can recall since the death of the 'policial' in the late seventies the sequence is delicious down to the essential living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake no such scenes are present or needed the argument is sand honest to the spectator an important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience no this is not miss marble a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savor every minute not just to see
