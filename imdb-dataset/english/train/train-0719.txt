<START> oh sam mraovich we know you tried so hard this is your magnum opus a shining example to the rest of us that you are certainly worth nomination into the academy of motion picture arts and sciences as you state on your 1998 era web site alas it's better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt with ben arthur you do just that br br seemingly assembled with a lack of instruction or education the film's screenplay guides us toward the truly bizarre with each new scene it's this insane excuse of a story that may also be the film's best ally beginning tepidly the homosexually titular characters ben and arthur attempt to marry going so far as to fly across country to do so in the shade of vermont's finest palm trees but all of this posturing is merely a lead in for blood then more blood and more and more blood i mean there must be at least 20 in fake blood make up in the final third of this film br br the film in its entirety is a technical gaffe from the sound to the editing to the music which consists of a single fuzzy bass note being held on a keyboard it's a wonder that the film even holds together on whatever media you view it on it's such a shame then that some decent amateur performances are wasted here br br no matter sam i'm sure you've made five figures on this flick in rentals or whatever drives poor souls such as myself to view this film sadly we're not laughing with you
<START> first of all i'd like to say that i love the ladies' man sketch on snl i always laugh out loud at tim meadows' portrayal of leon phelps however there is a difference between an 8 minute sketch and a feature length movie watching leon doing his show and making obscene comments to his listeners and coming up with all sorts of segments for his show like the ladies man presents which is reminiscent of alfred hitchcock presents is absolutely hilarious there's a great episode where cameron diaz role plays monica lewinski and leon plays bill and they call it the oral office see that's funny br br in the movie we don't see leon on the show too often in fact he gets kicked out of almost every radio station in the country and the plot revolves around his quest for true love involving a mystery letter that got dropped off at his houseboat signed by sweet thing karyn parsons who is famous for playing hillary on fresh prince of bel air works with him on the show and has a secret crush on leon the movie just piles on one boring subplot after another and the gags are boring as well the first time we see leon mention the word wang it's pretty funny when he uses it over and over again supposedly trying to get a laugh the joke has run dry most of the jokes he uses in the film are jokes we heard before and done better on the snl sketch and played out tediously for a whole hour and twenty five minutes they even try to insert a musical number by will ferrell and his gang of ladies' man haters who all want to destroy him because their wives had an affair with him to bring some life into this witless comedy ferrell has some funny moments and tries to make the best out of an otherwise unfunny role ferrell just has that unique comic talent and he's funny at almost anything he does even julianne moore gets a cameo watching her you can't but wonder what the hell is an oscar winning actress doing in this movie her name wasn't mentioned in the opening credits probably by her consent and of course a movie of this theme has to include the master of love himself billy dee williams billy dee is charismatic as always but even he can't breathe enough life into this film i also have to add that the soundtrack is full of soft r b hits which impairs the film even more giving it a horribly downbeat tone as if the script isn't boring enough i mean this is supposed to be a comedy the soundtrack would've been appropriate for something like love jones br br the ladies man only has sporadic laughs there are exceptions in which snl can produce a great movie out of a short sketch watch both of the wayne's world movies and you'll see how it's done but this movie just like adapting mary catherine gallagher's character to screen in superstar shows the flip side some sketches are meant to be remembered on snl and not on the silver screen br br my score 3 out of 10
<START> i caught this film late on a sat night sunday morning with my brother we had been drinking this is one of the best films for ripping apart i have ever seen from the 'luxury' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on roll off' ferry complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene this film rocks the continuity is so poor you cant help but notice it it slaps you in the face with the holes in the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance cut to his son and new girlfriend the ships pr director who knows kung fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way true on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion then the dad is there hugging them how who cares its magic there is not one redeeming feature to this film the casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table when being chased by the villains there is only one place to hide you've guessed it enter the villains who instead of checking under the one table proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar a corner bar in the casino fantastic they walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our casper to get around them and 'take them out' br br get some mates over get a few drinks in put this film on and howl
<START> if you merely look at the cover of this movie it's cool don't the movie itself put me to sleep it was slow paced had minimal violence and a poor use of suspense the acting was bottom feeder material and the plot while it would've been cool for a different movie was poorly shown here they even kill the only likeable character in the whole film i give it a 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the plot twist at the end other than that you might want to save yourself from this movie trash
<START> in brooklyn a century ago the rivalry between chuck connors and steve brodie and their competing volunteer fire brigades leads to brodie's famous bet that he can jump off the brooklyn bridge this is a story which will be familiar to a lot of people through a bugs bunny spoof bowery bugs from 1949 br br this generally very enjoyable film would probably be more widely available if it were not for the notorious and unsettling scene involving some chinese tenement dwellers a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes giving the film a great deal of historical interest in my view
<START> i had high hopes for this movie because i enjoyed the book so much however i don't think i would have understood the premise of the movie if i hadn't already read the book the movie is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of overpowering government rule but the book portrays the suffering much more thoroughly the corrupt government officials have comfortable almost luxurious lives while the common people struggle to obtain the bare necessities for survival perhaps most people feel this way toward their leaders and rulers regardless of whether or not they are actually oppressed or repressed orwell's dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world it has been several years since i've read the book but one hears references to big brother the thought police and newspeak frequently in the media and casual conversation probably many people using these terms don't realize where the terms came from i strongly recommend that you read the book
<START> despite having 6 different directors this fantasy hangs together remarkably well br br it was filmed in england nowhere near morocco in studios and on a few beaches at the outbreak of war everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon br br notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song i want to be a bandit can't you understand it it remains a favourite of many people
<START> errol flynn's greatest movie not just a sports movie with a wonder last 5 minutes where ward bond shines don't miss it just because you think its an old movie its a classic that could be easily missed do yourself a favour and don't
<START> like most people i love a christmas story i had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason it is awful same locale same narrator same director but the warm fuzziness of the original was lacking charles grodin was a poor choice to replace darrin mcgavin but i cannot imagine anyone being able to replace him the story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original the interaction with the neighbors the bumpuses is ridiculous in a christmas story ralphie's obsession with the bb gun seems cute but his obsession in this movie is boring scud farkus the original neighborhood bully is replaced in this film by yet another kid with braces and a weird hat but with little of the scud farkus menacing appeal it would be pretty difficult to equal the original even if this movie had been made with the original crew
<START> this has to be the cheapest film made in 21st century it is all the way low quality but at the end it falls below everything all the cheap tricks like flashing and darkness are used to hide those crappy computer effects br br all the actors are below average especially the main character anne fletcher simmone mackinnon there is a scene where anne is asked why you seem so careless the correct answer is because she can't act no matter what happens the world is about to be destroyed her friend is dying she is fired she has the same stupid grin in her face br br it is not only the movie which is b quality it is also the back cover description at least in finland the text mentions things like lorica gray vessel capital vessel and main character garrison harper and anna not anne fletcher the description sounds like a different movie both featuring character called fletcher and sea monsters
<START> inept boring and incoherent supernatural thriller in which college student cassie melissa sagemiller is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of her boyfriend sean casey affleck br br i can't begin to tell you how bad this is nothing of any importance ever happens nor is there ever any sort of actual entertainment value i did not like this cast in this particular film they are all sadly unconvincing then again their roles are no good to promote this as a horror film is a joke where are the scares there's no sense or suspense there are a few good songs but that's about it br br how on earth did this project get the green light writer director steve carpenter has no discernible vision or talent that i can sense worst of all the conclusion really makes the whole movie pointless br br the alleged killer cut that i watched is 86 minutes of pure tedium br br 1 10
<START> this is a plain old spooky ghost story i showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club and they were kept spellbound until the ending no blood or gore just good old fashioned suspense it starts out right from the beginning and builds and builds the ending is a real twist that caught me unawares br br well directed and well acted it is also a period piece set in the 1920s which added to the atmosphere br br i was so impressed i got the book by susan hill from amazon the movie follows the book rather closely br br it's a shame it's not readily available on dvd my copy is vhs this along with haunted are probably two of the best ghost stories i've ever scene which just goes to show that a little creativity outdoes in your face gore any day
<START> what does the marquis de sade have to do with egyptian archaeology and mermaid worshipping cults tobe hooper tries to answer that question in one weird little film br br genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archaeology father in alexandria egypt genie gets caught up with a mysterious hooker and blatant lesbian who services daddy on the side daddy gets sent back to the site where he uncovers a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid on it genie meets a descendant of the marquis de sade and falls for a hunky egyptian providing the film's hottest scenes eventually genie finds out she is to be a sacrifice and the protracted and bloody climax gets going wrapped around this story is footage of the marquis de sade in prison talking to a portrait of what looks like genie br br robert englund is terrific as both the marquis and his descendant his acting abilities have always been sideswiped by his makeup requirements so he is allowed to shine here his best performance is still in killer tongue if you have not seen that yet br br the rest of the cast including young genie are pretty and average the script however is problematic you will quickly learn that the marquis scenes are completely unnecessary except maybe the film makers had access to the cool set the mermaid cult that eventually saves genie makes no sense whatsoever who the mermaid is is never explained and its link to christianity which is hyped throughout the film is nothing the film is very anti christian as the archaeologist is a bible spouting father but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute there are plenty of scenes of depravity and violence but hooper probably had little idea of what the screenwriters were trying to say i know i have no idea br br so why am i recommending this film it is weird there is an extended sex scene for the ladies hunky egyptian rides a horse completely nude englund is marvelous do you like snakes this film is full of them this is like roger corman with a bigger budget knowing hooper somehow came up with crocodile after this is rather sad night terrors is not perfect but definitely worth a winking unserious look br br this is rated r for physical violence some sexual violence gore profanity female nudity male nudity sexual content sexual references and drug abuse br br
<START> everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful i wasn't going to comment but the film just bugs me so much and the writer director in particular so i must toss in my hat to join the naysayers br br i saw the original wicker man and really loved the cornucopia of music sensuality paganism in a modern world and the clash of theological beliefs this said i am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldn't be done for example i liked the original 1950's invasion of the body snatchers but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake both films can stand on their own another example is the thing the original as campy as it looks compared to today's standards has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with kurt russell my all time favorite horror movie so that small minority of people who like the wicker man re make can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it's a re make br br this film solidified for me neil labute's sexism and misogynistic tendencies it also made me wonder how executives wanting to make a serious thriller would green light a product that is so anti female there are too many scenes of cage hitting women just because he's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects aren't forthcoming the original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a goddess based religion the threat to the main character came from everyone male and female there was no sexual hierarchy br br the metaphor of bees drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient the drone must die especially when cage's character has bee allergies i kept wondering why the men on the island didn't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts these were not women with special supernatural powers and half of them seemed to be pregnant the other half old and fat and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women physically dominate them there didn't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy but if they were content being drones why make them unable to speak they could be used as a threat to cage because they will defend the community they are drones because neil labute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated that movie was made already the stepford wives anyone classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sh t together and were truly equal citizens br br the problem with the man hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when cage starts knocking women out i belief labute should've left the society an egalitarian one kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island no one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited so how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around there would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused thus an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children labute has said he created the fiancÃ© and daughter story thread to give cage's character an incentive to search i don't think you need that any child abused will make an adult react to save them the irony of course would be that the child cage saves ultimately brings him death br br the dialogue was contrived and campy the whole third act was hilarious the audience i saw it with guffawed and later booed at the end i just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded cage is we don't need that just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child most of us in america have seen law order and other cop procedurals we come into the movie as if we are cage's partner solving a mystery br br so much potential wasted neil labute stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst ridden plays and flicks of that sort stay with your own company of men leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers here is your jar of honey i'll watch that
<START> the first ten minutes of just looking really dictates the direction most of this movie takes lenny ryan merriman is a 14 year old boy living in new york in the '50s he has a burning desire to see two people have sex who are the best people he has in mind well his own mom and stepfather of course how pleasant unfortunately for lenny he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle's wife br br lenny's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex however the wife is quite pregnant and they aren't currently sleeping together then lenny makes a new friend him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls they have a little club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex the problem is it's not done in an innocent charming 1950's sort of way i am no prude by any means but i found it rather disturbing listening to these kids talk about masturbation blowjobs and anal sex that kind of rawness may work in a movie like kids 1995 but in this film it just seems perverted br br gretchen mol is utterly wasted here as hedy a former bra model who becomes the object of lenny's carnal desires jason alexander needs to stay as far away from the director's chair as possible for better or worse 1996 was awful and now this what a waste 1 10
<START> the film maybe goes a little far but if you love the show it's what you expect it's not a bad movie it's actually pretty good if you don't like the show don't see the movie it starts off a little slow maybe but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny there are even a few heart wrenching scenes toward the end after all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you also jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his show's existience he's got a pretty good point we care so much about the private details of celebrities lives so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national tv too if they were celebrities we wouldn't mind at all we'd eat it up do we not like his guest doing this just because they're poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a leave it to beaver world
<START> this is a film about life the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human spirit i defy anyone not to shed a tear by the end of the movie this is more than just a tear jerker its an engaging thought provoking drama with excellent performances from all the cast but especially derek luke and denzel washington 7 years on i'm amazed that luke is still a virtual unknown and washington only directed one other film nevertheless apart from a slow build up the story of this foster child's trials and tribulations and how it still affects him in adulthood is the sort of movie that stays with you long after you have seen it like many fox searchlight pictures this was more of a sleeper hit and didn't get the mass critical acclaim it deserves the scene where antwone finally meets his mother summed up the movie for me there were so many ways that could have been done and it could have been all schmaltzy or it could have been unrealistic but washington struck exactly the right tone his mother never said a word and could only shed a tear while antowne asked simply why her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything what could she say to defend herself one of the most moving cinematic scenes i have seen
<START> this was god awful the story was all over the place and more often than not i was confused because of horrible editing i felt no sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough they were extremely superficial people with no dimension cheesy cheesy stereotypes with subplots that went nowhere the stripper chick was just a distraction even if she was decent looking i don't know what this was attempting to be but how shocked was i when they showed this trash on sundance i almost cancelled my subscription you'd think a channel like that would show more quality films there are much much better gay and lesbian themed films out there the celluloid closet is an excellent documentary i thoroughly enjoyed wigstock the movie i'm sure there are others that have slipped my mind at the moment but what i'm trying to say is that this just wasn't worth it if you catch it on tv ok but otherwise don't bother br br there were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice sad i can count them on one hand otherwise the cinematography was pretty crappy as well the lighting was way off in a lot of places i think some of the effects were used to try and add to something that just had practically nothing going for it br br i can't deny johnny rebel is pretty hot without the blond hair of course too bad his acting did nothing for me stick with real porn buddy br br 3 10
<START> it sounds as if it should be a biography of claude monet but it's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a french synchronized swimming team there are no parents or teachers to speak of no school and boys are represented by one peripheral figure the hunky francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused br br pauline aquart is the youngest of the three only aspiring to join the team she so much admires she's kind of odd looking she's not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long bony limbs big feet and no derriere to speak of she's prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips after a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling br br adele haenel is older more well more developed physically what a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit sauntering around teasing the boys swishing her long blond hair but she's not what she seems or is she i couldn't quite figure it out the french are long on paradoxes and short on consistency no wonder francois is always sniffing after her br br there's not so much ambiguity in louse blachere's character she's on the team too but she's dumpy and plain and sensitive about it and has an intense crush on francois blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance br br the movie deals with the relationships between these three meaning intrigues deceptions hidden feelings and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another this is of course a tricky topic it becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between pauline and adele not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie the only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on and what little sex there is under the covers sometimes literally br br i don't think i want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much partly because it's suggestive rather than expressed through action partly because it's complex and partly because i'm not sure i got it all br br let me give an example okay adele is the girl the others envy she's also quite distant and self satisfied on top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all from the handsome but dumb francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from she brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio when pauline approaches her about joining the swim team adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys a superior and self indulgent narcissist you know but then the soi disant slut takes the skinny pauline under her wing and reveals to pauline that she's still a virgin really yes really pauline begins to draw closer to adele and adele finally confesses that she'd like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like pauline to do it for her pauline now drawn sexually to adele performs the task with subdued relish now adele would really like to get it on with a man preferably older and experienced so she takes pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows pauline to the powder room the two girls stand there staring at one another neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other but adele stands so close that pauline slowly loosens her own reins reaches up and kisses adele on the lips adele steps back smiling and says there now that wasn't so bad was it and then walks back into the club br br that's a pretty close description of whatever is going on between pauline and adele but what the hell is going on initially adele treats pauline like an irrelevant child later like a close friend finally like a potential lover and the minute pauline responds adele walks off satisfied is she using pauline the way she seems to be using men does it satisfy adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude i don't know br br i've slighted louise blachere as the third member of the trio the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity but i've only skipped her for considerations of space br br should you see it by all means just compare it to the typical american movie about high school kids for men some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot
<START> i've seen this movie today for the first time and i never heard of it before probably because of it's poor message br br first of all the directing itself is quite good the actors played well and the cgi i'm not a fan of cgi is magnificent but that alone doesn't make a movie no story at all no message behind beautiful exploited talents br br or do i have to make people remember the art of a director is not only your vision but to know how to tell a story and this is what's missing the whole 7 minutes br br there for a simple 4 rating
