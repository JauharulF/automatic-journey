<START> first of all let's start out by saying that robert englund doug bradley and melinda clark should be commended for having to be associated with this piece of drivel i had to give this a 1 it wouldn't let me give it a zero wanna know how bad this movie is my mom calls me from across town and tells me son i just watched the stupidest movie ever i responded as saying the killer tongue huh she was like how did you know that that's how bad this movie is i mean it looked like a good movie at first freddy pinhead melinda okay i'll give it a chance i sat through the rest of this movie only because i wrote a column for reviews of horror movies i implore you don't waste your time money or even brain cells on this ludicrous piece of crap run away far away if you see it on the shelf at hollywood video blockbuster or even your local video store turn it around and walk away and i still want my two hours back dang it
<START> we now travel to a parallel universe where the appearance of giant prehistoric monsters flattening cities are part of the daily routine it's the world of godzilla rodan mothra ghidrah and their kind a strange world and one made even stranger by the appearance of an unidentified flying turtle called gamera br br forever in the shadow of the monolithic toho studios second rung daiei studios were more famous for samurai sagas than monster movies in the mid 60s they decided to join the giant reptile race and designed a rival monster series to toho's mammothly successful godzilla they wisely chose gamera as their flagship a giant turtle that shoots flames from between its snaggle teeth and spins through the air by shooting flames through its shell's feet holes and at one point you almost see the paper mache shell catch fire br br the first gamera film gamera the invincible as it was sold to the us is a virtual mirror of the first godzilla film only 10 years behind american fighters chase an unmarked plane over the arctic to its fiery demise the nuclear bomb on board ignites and awakens the giant gamera from its icy slumber feeding off atomic energy it immediately goes on a rampage and the world wants to destroy gamera once and for all but a little japanese boy named kenny who has a psychic connection with the giant turtle and even keeps a miniature version in an aquarium by his bedside believes gamera is essentially kind and benevolent he's like a little jewish kid with a pinup of hitler gamera is a good turtle he pleads then sulks and puts on a face like someone's pooped in his coco pops miraculously the world's leaders listen to him and so begins z plan to save the world and gamera from complete destruction br br released in 1965 gamera was a surprising hit the annoying infantile anthropomorphism actually worked on kiddie audiences in both japan and the us and the sight of gamera on two feet stomping miniatures of tokyo and the north pole is gloriously chintzy most surprising of all is the longevity of the series eight original gamera films plus a slew of recent remakes not bad for a mutant reptile whose only friend is mewing eight year old milquetoast and if i hear gamera is friends to all children one more time i'm going to crush tokyo which appears to be an easy task in the parallel universe where children are smart and turtles are bigger than a seiko billboard in the 1965 turtle fest gamera
<START> spoilers highly charge police drama about a serial killer loose in and around the small town of riverside wisconsin who's being tracked down by the local police using policewoman gina pulasky helen hunt as an undercover decoy to catch him br br nothing new in this made for tv movie that you haven't seen before but the depth of the acting and screenplay is unusually good and brings out a lot about not only the killer but the policewoman's as well as her fellow policeman lover state of mind br br having been put under psychiatric care after shooting an armed and unstable assailant who attacked her partner with a rifle officer palusky is given the task to go undercover to get close to murder suspect kayle timler steven webber after he was positively identified by the little girl sahsa kim kluznick who saw him not far from where little timmy curtis was found stabbed 18 times to death the next day br br getting a job at the mr c diner where tim works gina gets to become very friendly with him and later tells him in order to get tim to open up about him possibly being the serial murderer that she once killed in a hit and run accident a 79 year old woman br br tim who is said to have a genius iq doesn't seem to pick up on gina's attempt to trap him even when he later sees her at a bowling alley with her fellow cops spending a night out playing some weird cat and mouse game with her tim at one point get's gina at knife point to admit that she's wired but gina tells him that she was forced to do it by the police to get a break and an early release from prison besides tim's instability and criminal actions we find out that gina isn't all there as well she seems to be suffering from her being rejected by her father who left her with a drunk and abusing mother as a young girl that's effecting her work as an undercover policewoman br br there's also the fact that gina's lover policeman will mccaid jeff fahey who's estranged from his wife and two kids who's also on the serial murder case is too overprotective of her that causes gina to almost blow her cover and that has her later being taken off her assignment br br put back on undercover duty by her boss capt cheney dan conway over the objections of officer mccaid after another young boy 12 year old davy marish was found murdered gina finally get's herself together and gets tim to admit that he's the person who's responsible for the string of murders in the area gina does it by having a hidden tape recorder that she replaced the one that she gave to him to show how honest she is hidden on her br br the movie in the company of darkness wasn't really that exceptional but the acting by helen hunt jeff fahey and especially steven webber was it was these high caliber performances that lifted the film well above the average made for tv movie were used to seeing
<START> in 1692 salem a devious child's lies about a slave's involvement in witchcraft sends an entire community into an uproar costume drama starring claudette colbert and fred macmurray isn't stuffy though neither is it a vivid depiction of contagious hysteria worked on by three writers walter ferris durward grimstead and bradley king the story elements are rather interesting especially coming out of hollywood in 1937 though to anyone who has since read arthur miller's the crucible the hoked up melodrama on display here won't be tolerated for very long biggest problem with the picture may lie in the casting colbert and macmurray are an ill matched pair of lovers hindered by the witch hunt macmurray being far too contemporary a presence for these surroundings 1 2 from
<START> i rented the film i don't think it got a theatrical release here out expecting the worse the previews made the film look awful i was in fact very surprised it was well worth watching it was loosely scripted almost like an ensemble piece of film it had some very funny moments in it and although flawed is an effective satire on the show and the people on the show without being too scathing it is flawed mainly by the awful soundtrack of bludgeoning 'comedy' effects but on the whole it comes across as honest and generally true to form of the show in an altmanesque or larry sanders way br br at the moment it is the fashion to be critical of jerry springer he is also an easy target springer could have made citizen kane and it would be proclaimed 'the worst film ever made' i recommend this film for anybody interested in the show a flawed but innovative and interesting piece of film
<START> this is just one more of those hideous films that you find on lifetime tv which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner along with other such nasty films as the burning bed enough or monster this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she's not such a bad person after all give us a break here's my question to the filmmakers if letourneau were a man and vili were a 12 year old girl would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person answer hell no br br imagine switching the genders in this film and then you'll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage were the genders switched there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal instead we'd likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl his lascivious behavior landing him in prison and his brainwashed victim suffering from stockholm syndrome the only reason letourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex br br let's call a spade a spade letourneau is a pedophile plain and simple no ifs ands or buts she's a criminal who belongs in prison and deserves our derision and contempt but certainly not our pity or empathy
<START> bizarre trippy forget about a story and full steam ahead low budget sci fi about the williams family living in the california desert they become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness apparently they've been caught in a time space warp where past present and future collide br br this is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects a constant light and sound show dinosaur like creatures that have at each other a friendly and tiny little e t who enchants the granddaughter and so on this picture does show off a little imagination if nothing else br br very nice music by richard band engaging special effects work from the likes of david allen randall william cook and peter kuran and importantly a likable family are key assets it generates a sense of child like amazement it may very well be that it's more of a romp for kids or the kids inside many of us who are able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation br br i found it hard to resist it's a short and sweet 80 minutes diversion and a decent credit for director john bud cardos of kingdom of the spiders fame and executive producer charles band br br 7 10
<START> what happened 'doubt' had so much potential to be a brilliant film but instead it faltered with a dragging simplistic plot line which made me want to stop watching the only thing the film had going for it was the brilliance of meryl streep who no doubt deserved the oscar nomination though it was not one of her best performances she still gave a solid and truthful character to us which blossomed through the screen br br however not even the brilliance of a screen legend could save this film from going down hill from the boring start which had no power or punch to the less than convincing ending the film was truly a disappointment especially since it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers it was obvious the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film which dragged on for too long with too much talk and not enough action br br furthermore the other oscar nominations were less than convincing though philip seymour hoffman gave a decent performance it was by no means oscar worthy especially since they completely left out performances such as will smith in seven pounds amy adams did not deserve the nomination watching amy adams was like watching a cardboard box as it was one sided and plain it would have made more sense to nominate her for a razzie as i am sure she would have walked away victorious viola davis gave a short but truthful performance but the length of her performance made me question whether the academy really should have given her the nomination br br overall i consider doubt to be one of the most disappointing films of 2008 it was a mess of a film with so much potential and i do not recommend it the only shining light in the film is meryl streep who though gives a stunning solid performance doesn't even do enough to save this film 10
<START> anna ursula andress is brought in as an official r n by ex lover benito varotto duilio del prete ostensibly to nurse an aging widower count leonida bottacin mario piso back to health after a heart attack but benito is actually leading a group of heirs and businessmen including american entrepreneur mr kitch jack palance with ulterior motives reflected by what anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the count he has a history of well liking women and would be actually a bit more vulnerable as he is cured the bad guys get derailed as anna does not go along and grows closer to the count the ending might be said to be ironic but it is probably better described as predictable br br but so much for plot this film is totally an erotic comedy from start to finish and oh how good there are many nude scenes including ones of anna and jole one of the malevolent heiresses played by luciana paluzzi both ursula and luciana are noteworthy continental ex bond women and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers as she did in thunderball remember fiona volpe luciana plays a femme fatale sort of although less elegantly br br perhaps the best scene is anna's slow complete strip and jump in bed with the young adone the other patient who incredibly is resisting in an attempt to find out what he knows about the plot but even at this point she is already two faced for the better for she has decided not to go along however benito is more than a two timer with women having had lengthy flings in the past with both anna and jole and the rival best erotic scene follows an invective filled to put it mildly argument between him and jole this is a standing up encounter in which luciana is down to black panties only another nice one is ursula swimming fully naked in the estate's pool the count is free as the client to put his hands wherever he wants to on ursula and he takes advantage hey somehow i've gone back to the actresses' names in my descriptions erotic scenes involving other women include an amusing naked wine cellar chase the sensuous nurse is compact 77 minutes but it doesn't need to be it is enjoyable without interruption start to finish definitely recommended br br
<START> a pointless movie with nothing but gratuitous violence the only fun i had was playing spot the location as much of it was filmed in my home town of regina saskatchewan i like to support locally produced films but this one was a major disappointment
<START> it's very hard to say just what was going on with the lady from shanghai and what the film could have been without studio interference orson welles' prime interest in film at this point was to raise money for his theater indeed funding his own projects is what drove him to seek out acting jobs he made lady from shanghai for his soon to be ex wife rita hayworth harry cohn was fearful for rita's image and held back the release of this movie for one year br br the plot concerns an irish sailor michael o'hara who falls in love with else hayworth stunning with short blond hair her husband is a well known criminal attorney arthur bannister everett sloane who is as crippled on the inside as he is out he hires o'hara to work on his yacht and there o'hara is drawn deeper and deeper into a web of murder and deceit br br the lady from shanghai moves at a snail's pace though i agree with one of the posters that films today are criticized for taking time to build a plot still this movie drags the scene in the fun house is fantastic welles wanted it without music though and i believe the studio cut it down it's a shame the photography throughout is stunning atmospheric bold and very stylish br br welles was an excellent actor handsome in his youth charismatic and possessing a magnificent voice and technique but in many films it's almost as if he doesn't trust himself or doesn't take the time to develop a character instead he relies on externals such as accents and fake noses one of the only times he didn't do this was tomorrow is forever where the director gets an excellent deeply felt performance out of him contrast that with compulsion where he shows he is a master of pure technical acting as he phones in his performance here welles is doing quadruple duty as director star co writer and narrator sporting a completely unnecessary accent and looking intense was a fast way to a characterization nevertheless he is always compelling br br the supporting players are excellent including sloan and glenn anders hayworth gorgeous and soft voiced her singing was again dubbed by anita ellis is as usual a complete goddess and one of the great screen presences what a sad life for such a vibrant beauty br br any film that orson welles directed is worth seeing and the lady from shanghai is no exception but this one leaves the viewer frustrated as does the magnificent ambersons as does any work that welles did within the studio system he was a great artist who should have been given a freer reign he wasn't he was a strange dichotomy he needed more freedom but as is evidenced by some of his later work he needed the structure of the studio alas he couldn't have both
<START> the definition of an abomination as defined by webster's dictioary is a cause of abhorrence or disgust if someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for alone in the dark please let me know because this is the best i can come up with however i do no feel that in anyway this word describes how truly awful this film is br br i went to see this film with two of my roommates one has very similar tastes to me the other is an action adventure flick guru this latter guy usually doesn't care about the size of the plot holes as long as the movie contains lots of explosions he will walk away satisfied br br that being said we entered the theater for the friday viewing of alone in the dark little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater when it started i knew why immediately br br it begins with the worst opening scene of any movie and unfortunately i have to admit it only gets worse from there the opening scene is a 5 minute scroll text that is narrated yet i understand why it was narrated the director must have understood that only illiterate people would even ascertain the thought of paying to see this movie yet not only is this first scene the longest scroll text in the history of cinema but it also makes no sense it seems as if in the same sequence we are hearing about to completely separate movies one is about an ancient civilization and its tampering with a portal the other is about a crazy scientist and his experiments on orphans if you are reading this and are confused you are not alone br br then the awful storyline acting effects and camera work begin tara reid is horrendous as an actress she does nothing to even for one second make you think that she is a museum curator slater is just bad not convincing and has no chemistry with reid br br the plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man the entire time myself and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like what is this and what is going on other than this scrolling garbage we have a few narrated sequences by slater himself are they good no do they explain anything no do we at any point as an audience have the slightest inkling as to why we should care what happens once again no br br then we have a random sex scene we are told that slater and reid are together yet at no time do they act as though they even care about on another but then bam sex scene once again i don't know br br a good oh i don't know 30 seconds after that woeful scene ends we have a gunfight with 20 or so military and a similar number of alien things this is set to a heavy metal track and causes more brain hemorrhaging than one ever thought possible br br and if that wasn't enough br br there exists no main villain there is the scientist and there are the alien things at one point the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military outpost why how did he become the supreme commander of these things why do they listen to him once again i have no idea br br the movie ends with slater and reid walking in an evacuated city why was the city evacuated did the alien things break through did the military tell them who knows and by this point who cares i didn't and you won't br br but to top it off slater and reid are attacked by an alien thing even though it was stated that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight and thats right you guessed it it the middle of the ing day and it's bright as can be maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses i don't know and i don't care br br now after the movie ended i ran outside the theater all 6 foot 6 inches of me waving my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to go see this movie even my gung ho action adventure roommate who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted 2 hours of explosion into 1 film to be the greatest thing ever created admitted that plot holes were very evident in this film br br to sum up this crap fest i give it a 0 0 10 and would give it lower if i could br br unequivocally the worst movie ever made i wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy
<START> truly amazing film the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening a world vastly overpopulated unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer and all our natural resources spent in this nightmarish degenerate society we have the great charlton heston as a likable film noirish style detective trying to fathom the truth behind a murder opposite the film noir legend edward g robinson turning in a fine last performance br br one of the images that will always stay with me from this film is the masses of people that populate the stairwells and the way in which thorne heston has to hop through them every time he uses them br br the movie's use of music is note worthy too although it contains no score in the usual sense the opening theme is good and the subsequent snatches of music we here in simonson's apartment and especially the beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic are outstandingly atmospheric
<START> warning contains a spoiler corny plot and in many cases terrible acting fontaine is great but some others particularly richard ney ivy's husband are exceedingly wooden ney lies in bed dying of arsenical poisoning with every hair in place yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful more faithful to the book than most movies of its era casting joan fontaine as a poisoner and an adulteress which was just as shocking then i'm not kidding kids was a masterful stroke she's just her usual joan fontainey self as murderers were supposed to she dies by falling feet foremost through the floor into an empty space
<START> if you're one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as 'book of the dead' 'book of eibon' or 'necronomicon' then you should feel right at home with malefique a film which also features an occult tome one with the power to change the destinies of all involved discovered by four french prisoners sharing a cell the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by danvers a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished finders of the book are carrÃ¨re gÃ©rald laroche a company embezzler shopped by his wife lassalle philippe laudenbach who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body builds to execute an escape plan the halfwit pÃ¢querette dimitri rataud who once ate his baby sister and the 'librarian' marcus clovis cornillac supposedly driven mad by reading who murdered his wife reminding the viewer of meat loaf's equally bizarre bosomy male in fight club 1999 lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet one who is especially protective of the infantile pÃ¢querette with the coming of the book however and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents marcus assumes greater and greater significance at first assured of an early bail meanwhile carrÃ¨re takes little more than academic interest in events suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and as the prisoners experiment danvers' book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers br br staged for the most part within a prison cell and between four or five characters malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed closed in nature of proceedings elsewhere more than anything this is a film about being trapped either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding i'm going to escape says carrÃ¨re at the start of the film wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an 'escape' may not be one a man might imagine br br with all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first time feature director eric vallette's credit that his film succeeds as well as it does as critics have noticed it is a film with strong freudian overtones lassalle's distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus danvers' original placenta fetish the dark cell as a primitive womb from which 'delivery' is awaited etc with so many interesting aspects to the script vallette hardly puts a foot wrong and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what when one comes down to it is just a matter of four guys four bunks one folding table and a book there's a genuine growing lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages while one or two moments the aforementioned blinking vagina or what ultimately happens to pÃ¢querette are unsettlingly memorable the pacing of many of the dark events in malefique is deliberate rejecting the rapid cutting of many hollywood productions a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick fix action and gore perhaps this is a particularly european manner as one recalls a similar measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as verhoeven's the fourth man 1983 a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye br br lensed well in 1 85 1 malefique benefits from excellent performances and if for this viewer at least the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been the journey to the final shot was worth taking coming so soon after the release of the similarly well received haute tension aka switchblade romance 2003 this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the french industry this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from asia
<START> this had to be one of the most god awful wrestlemanias ever and is only saved by 2 matches the hardcore match between edge and mick foley also vince mcmahon against shaun michaels the main event between cena and triple h was a complete washout and to be honest i nearly fell asleep it was so actionless the casket match was not worthy of having the undertaker appear in it and the match between the boogie man and booker t was a complete joke if you are really a big fan of the wwe and have missed the early days of the wwf and the wrestlemanias 17 and 19 you'll probably love this but i found that this wrestlemania left a lot to be desired
<START> walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema how do you get laughs out of other people's misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too long br br well this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs beautiful scenery and quite a good buzz as well i particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white europeans liked it and marijuana illegal since 'those other races' used it undoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the world br br an extraordinary dvd extra commentary two of them in fact run thru the whole movie with both the actors and then again with the writers i kept seeing things i was sure were not in the first movie but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take what a hoot don't miss it 9 10 stars
<START> the tortuous emotional impact is degrading whether adult or adolescent the personal values shown in this movie belong in a bad psychodrama if anywhere at all this movie has a plot but it is all evil from start to end this is no way for people to act and degrades both sexes all the way through the movie teen killing bad preteen sex bad emotional battering bad animal cruelty bad psychological torture bad parental neglect bad the only merit if any is the excellent color shots of contrasting red blond and green leaves a bad feeling for anyone that respects life and peace what a bad mistake to make or to watch it is ugly
<START> robert culp they call his character doctor i think he's a vet or something and family move to an affluent low tax zero law enforcement suburb lantern jawed culp and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbor kids get drunk and go cruising through his front yard at 60mph he presses charges which arouses the kids' ire and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign br br marilyn manson er marlyn mason rather plays his fretful boiled celery wife who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services but the system is getting culp nowhere and he's not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music and we all know what movie people do when the system fails but this is based on a true story which makes it even better br br it should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient '70s funk o matic teenage theme music that warns us when they're up to no good this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even handedly really it doesn't make a big generational thing out of it kudos for that br br anyway if you like dogs or at least believe in protecting their civil rights like me and you like justice and you like fire and you like justice for dogs by way of fire and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are too damn soft then this flick's ethos is up your alley no it's not really good at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word there's nothing subtle or understated or clever about it it's just sort of a feature length psa for vigilantism it does however capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other beloved works remember in frank miller's the dark knight returns when batman leads the mutants on horseback to reclaim gotham city remember that scene in a christmas story where the kid pounds the bully's face in remember how cool that was or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors yeah mon br br unfortunately this was a 1973 made for tv movie that i just happened to catch at 4am on my local wb affiliate and it's probably not destined for dvd release but after being inspired by this film do you think i'm gonna just sit here and take it
<START> aldolpho steve buscemi an aspiring film maker lives in a battered nyc apartment and relies on his mother to help make the rent he has a beautiful neighbor named angelica jennifer beals who may or may not be married but who aldolpho would love to star in his movie when al unexpectedly gets a financial promise of funding for his film from a strange man named joe he thinks he's got it made that is until joe takes al along on an adventure to steal a porsche for part of the financial backing will the film be made before aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone and will angelica star in the film this is in this viewer's opinion an awful movie the script is abysmal with a plot that wanders willy nilly beals practically snarls all of her lines and buscemi though likable is nondescript there is a good deal of distasteful material and unsavory characters to boot finally the production values are very poor too making the film look second rate at all times if you have time on your hands it is still a good idea not to take a chance with this movie but if you are the proverbial glutton for punishment go ahead and watch the darn thing beals does look beautiful after all
