<START> the gangster genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody in retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clichÃ©s that have been utilized in it's genre thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it the sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it's content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance humor and unvarnished violence the key protagonist tony soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew however tony is of two persona's one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent with out any inhibitions or contradictions i still adamantly believe that the sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory all things considered i could make an elaborate statement on the series but i won't if ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism search for these definitions vital ambiguous unrelenting epic uncompromising and the sopranos shattered visage will be smiling right back at you
<START> sadly this is not 'the best british gore film since hellraiser' though the dvd cover claims this which is what tricked me into buying it it is however an homage to many of the great horrors of old films from most notably the amicus stable br br cradle is shot on mini dv which though we all know has more of a tv feel than a movie can be done so much better every scene set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way standard key fill rear setup which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece the gore content is quite frankly laughable from the opening shots where we see a man's obviously foam rubber head torn apart through to tacky cheap prop hammers the creature effects and the terrible cg there was nothing in there that impressed me at all br br the acting is abominable from the near comatose detective to the brummie dwarf via dani filth the least convincing horror movie bad guy i have ever witnessed each of the substories is more formulaic than the last and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs look out for the 'mental asylum' a georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside and the most bizarre and not in a good way padded cell i have seen br br it took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering nay running away at any available opportunity i actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running br br it does however mark one of the last known appearances of emily booth's breasts which i guess is one um two things it has going for it once that's out of the way though it is all downhill br br i've heard people say good things about alex chandon and i would love to believe them but on this evidence i'm not likely to if you want a decent homage to amicus avoid this and go for the league of gentlemen christmas special instead br br currently battling it out with blair witch 2 book of shadows for the title of worst film i have ever seen
<START> this movie is unworthy of the omen title it is so bad that it has actually damaged the classic nature of the first three it never should have been made they ought to change the title br br they don't even spell damien thorn's name correctly and there are no daggers the most important element of all the omen films pull it from the shelves and burn it
<START> visual creative epic of inimitable style br br this film may neither have the most alternative dramaturgy nor the most artistic acting but who dares to say this film is no art i'm not a supporter of the idea that an important film must be serious non commercial or bothering me with questions even there are a lot of films apposite to this attributes that i like br br bogus journey for sure is not one of this films what you get is pure excessive creativity with a very positive charged childlike energy this film doesn't reflect reality its friendly naive and utopian imagine the world of the future described by rufus for me it would be a pretty nice time place combination to live in except of that music br br technically bogus jorney is very well made i always liked the cinematography and the sceneries of this movie especially in this point bogus journey tops its prequel by far also the effects are good and i think most of them very made without cgi i generally prefer the good old effects in big budget movies sure its 'just another hollywood movie' out of some peoples view but i think it is this in a very charismatic way br br a short word to the soundtrack all the band and orchestral music fits very well into the film also the sound design has no lack i am not a big fan of rock music but i had to get this track by winger from the scene 'station' builds the bill and ted robots in the van i love the unorthodox camera work at its beginning br br let me conclude saying this br br this film is very naive and very imaginative it is way better than panzerkreuzer potemkin the godfather eraserhead or aguirre the wrath of god it is absolutely superior to citizen kane apocalypse now or chris markers sans soleil it is even better than total recall no way yes way br br bill and ted's bogus journey is simply the best movie ever made br br who dares to disagree makes himself guilty of artsie fartsy behavior or likes terminator salvation what is the bigger self defamation br br ps part 1 is not the better movie so bogus jorney is a superior sequel not even terminator 2 is a superior sequel its not
<START> years ago a movie going friend and i went to see a horror film that we thought would be good because it starred john cassavetes for the uninitiated john cassavettes was an actor screen writer and director married to actress gena rowlands nominated for oscars three times who wrote and directed a variety of good low budget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat up until seeing the incubus we did not understand that john cassavetes income was made from any movie that was offered to him had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether but we did not walk out at the time my friend and i jokingly indicated it was the worst movie ever made now frankly this is not true i have seen many poorly made films on friday nights on cinemax did i just say that out loud that are far worse than the incubus almost any movie starring brian bosworth is by definition a worse movie than the incubus certainly santa claus conquers the martians is a worse movie than the incubus however i have since consistently used the incubus as a threshold below which i do not want to fall when talking to this friend about a movie i may have seen i will always remark that it was better or worse than the incubus br br http thevillagevideot blogspot com
<START> narratives Â whether written visual or poetic epics Â generally try to avoid too may characters readers and viewers after all can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who this is especially true in film i think simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema viewers like myself however don't have that problem because we see all our films on dvd or vhs br br a year ago i was introduced to audrey tautou a french actress whom i first saw in the fabulous destiny of amelie poulain 2001 and later in a very long engagement 2004 both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters this earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways more characters and more complexity br br now other directors have used those techniques before robert altman with the player 1992 short cuts 1993 gosford park 2001 and others paul thomas anderson did the same with magnolia 1999 stanley kramer did it with a mad mad mad mad world in 1963 a comedy of almost epic proportions the difference with this film is first the director lets us 'see' inside the head of some of the characters and second some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewer's memory as the story flip flops between different time periods br br the basic Â the core so to speak Â story concerns a young woman irene tautou who is told by a fellow commuter on a train that she will meet her true love on that day this occurs in the first few minutes of the film the clever irony at this point is that irene doesn't realize that the young man opposite gilbert robin may be that 'one true love' and nor does he br br they go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter however chaos results throughout the rest of the day not only for the two young people but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere and yet br br if the story were simply that it could tend to be boring and even quite predictable not so the script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace but which are turned into believable extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again for example the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours consider your alternatives two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before irene and her man of destiny meet again or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen consider again what would happen br br all of that is interesting enough what was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was the one for irene or whether it was in fact the young man on the train that kept me guessing for a while br br i'll let you think about that should you see this delightful romp br br recommended for all
<START> that's right you heard me this movie is a freaking' abomination first off the band who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called the naked brothers band not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians they can't even play anything also the lead singer sounds more girly than geddy lee and even more his voice is horrible not only are they terrible musicians but they're terrible actors led by a crappy director and thin plot this has got to be the dumbest movie ever i wish this website would let you use a vote of zero or below out of 10 because giving this filth a 1 10 is being way too generous br br i'm not sure that you can call this a comedy film if you're looking for comedy with music go to that weird al yankovic guy 'cause he does it a whole lot better than these untalented tweens
<START> i have been waiting for this movie a long time especially because juhi chawla is in this she's a great actress br br this movie contains six stories it's a new concept flew over from hollywood so it's not a new item br br 1 khamini priyanka chopra is a dancer she wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her but then rahul salman khan appears and he claims to be her boyfriend br br priyanka chopra is still not a good actress when she yells i get annoyed salman khan cannot play comic roles but in his serious parts he is marvelous br br 2 vinay anil kapoor is married to seema juhi chawla he gets in a midlife crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman with forgetting what he really has in life his wife and kids br br anil kapoor en juhi are natural born actors actresses they are great but this story is to thin for them br br 3 shiven akshaye khanna is going to get married to gia ayesha takia but he gets cold feet and blows the wedding off br br 4 ashutosh joh abraham is married to tehzeeb vidya balan she gets an accident and suffers a memory loss now she doesn't know that she loves her husband anymore br br 5 raju govinda is a cab driver he meets stephani shannon esrechowitz who is a white woman who is in love with an indian male but he is about to get married with an indian woman raju has to bring staphani to that man but falls in love with her br br i never liked govinda's movies he is very annoying not funny but in this movie i liked him very much like he has been growing up the last years br br 6 oh yes there is sohail khan he plays ram dayal who is just married to phoolwati isha koppikar he want to get some serious action with her but every time her family comes in between br br sohail khan is not a handsome actor but he is funny i like his movies br br now here's the problem all these stories aren't interesting to make one story from six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting here and there the stories touch each other but is not significant for the characters br br my conclusion priyanka cannot act loose that woman in the bollywood industry sohail khan should make more movies this role for him was too small salman khan cannot act comic roles but real serious movies that's written on his life as an actor this movie sucks and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like anil kapoor juhi chawla akshaya khanna and john abraham br br it's just like you have the ability to make a movie with amitabh bachchan and you only let him sing a lullaby
<START> wow this was a great italian zombie movie by two great director's luci fulci zombie and bruno mattie hell of the living dead lucio started this movie and was ill so the great bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than i expected it to turn out so if you have seen hell of the living dead directed by bruno mattie and if you saw zombie directed by lucio fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great zombie make up witch equals great looking zombies has a funny zombie flying head and zombie birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a zombie that only happed to two people but they are mainly just the great toxic zombies like in bruno matties hell of the living dead so if you like italian zombie movies or just zombie movie's in general than check this one out its a great italian zombie movie
<START> it was a decent movie i actually kind of enjoyed it but the ending is so abrupt there is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends what happens after the concert what happens with her boyfriend does she hook up with grant does she come beck in the next semester and what about angela obviously holly's performance would knock angela down a few pegs but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts there is so much left up in the air and it's very unsatisfying i don't know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something but it is a terrible ending and i think that it really makes the movie a joke i was very disappointed
<START> this movie is an embarrassment to film making i can't believe it was even listed as a comedy not funny not only was the script atrocious but the casting people should be shot gail o'grady is just a great actress but beyond that 99 of the rest of the cast ouch pretty much everyone else wow it is hard to even wow here is the number one rule about comedy don't try to be funny there are a lot of very talented actors in canada who can do drama and comedy none of them were used in this film canadian nepotism and casting directors are helping to perpetuate bad film making in canada i realize this is technically a us film but look at the director actors location etc i just saw this on bravo they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this film again there are a lot of great films out there that can't get airtime and they show this crap
<START> after the initial shock of realizing the guts of mr branagh to film this i was literally shaking with the excitement of having this epic just ahead of me i was not disappointed so true to shakespeare and yet so accessible it blew my mind i always enjoy seeing or rather listening to branagh and it made me wonder is this movie dubbed in other countries that would be like painting a moustache on the mona lisa
<START> you may say to yourself don johnson as elvis can that work is it possible seems like an terrible choice to me but perhaps i should have an open mind maybe i'll be surprised maybe he can pull it off br br not br br don johnson is not a bad actor but he is an awful elvis he's too short too weak voiced too sharply featured well you've already imagined how bad he would be add to that a hokey black wig and heavy handed eye liner and mascara and it's a big fat embarrassing mess br br the best i can say is that since johnson's acting is decent and since his impersonation is so far off after a while you don't even think of him as elvis anymore you see him as some other crazed pop star instead then on that level the movie becomes watchable br br stephanie zimbalist is also not ideally cast as the tall beauty queen linda thompson but she is attractive in her own right and plays the part with the honesty elegance and intelligence we've come to expect from all her roles there may be too much intelligence in her performance you have to be kind of a dope to stick with a dope abusing dope br br there's nothing new to this story we've heard it many times before if you've looking for new info or insight you won't find it it's told as a love story an unrequited one linda for elvis and elvis for drugs
<START> i remember a certain tuesday the morning of 18 6 02 to be exact i was dozed off trying to convince myself to get out of bed when a horrific explosion was heard i went to the kitchen where i have a view of several neighborhoods in the southern jerusalem and saw a pillar of smoke rising from a distant point the sight of the smoke was followed a minute later by the waling of sirens i remember rushing to my bedroom taking out my binoculars racing back to the kitchen and spotting the image of a glass shattered bus the bus was still near the pick up station where a terrorist boarded on it and with a single click on a tnt device murdered 25 passengers many of whom were on their way to school the wife of a good friend of mine sat on the bus at the back row a seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life br br i'm sure that every israeli has at least one terror related memory he wishes he never would have had and it was only a matter of time before someone made a film about it as it turned out the movie was about to become a repressed memory of its own br br the film is about a play write on a dry run haim buzaglo portrayed by hmmm haim buzaglo who also wrote and directed the film that spends the better part of his day conducting staring contests with his blank word processor page in the meantime his girlfriend a field reporter for the israeli commercial channel decides to make a piece about a debt ridden ex army officer buzaglo bored and a bit paranoid due what is medically known as the what on earth this hot babe is dating me syndrome asks a private eye to conduct a stakeout on his girlfriend br br as the detective progresses in his investigation his observations are permeating into the play and later on to the lives of its actors in the meantime the play metamorphoses from a comic play into an indictment against the aloofness of the israeli society as for the movie well the movie becomes an exercise in frenzy editing ensconced in its petty cardboard characters and unreliable dialogs while drifting miles away from the subject it was supposed to deal with in the first place br br when i say cardboard characters i refer to the characters that under the writer director's obsession for a meaningful film were devoid of any genuine dialogs and any shred of reliability i won't elaborate too much about it suffice to say that i'm sure that homeless barefoot male prostitutes rarely go the theater with the intention to see a play that is br br this movie according to haim buzaglo himself is the first part of a current agenda trilogy i sincerely hope that the other two films will be derived from the experiences like the one i wrote about in the beginning of my review as opposed to the secluded world of characters that are anything but existent and a plot that is anything but compelling br br 4 out of 10 in my filmometer br br p s this movie was a landmark in austerity it was shot in ten days all the cast worked for free and the entire cost of the film was about 12 000 no i didn't omit a zero or two twelve thousand dollars makes you wonder why it took 34 000 to complete blair witch project
<START> darkwolf tells the tale of a young waitress named josie samaire armstrong who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend mary tippi hedren is killed by a werewolf you see werewolves actually exist in modern day america there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the werewolf threat headed up by detective steve turley ryan olosio who has the difficult task of telling josie that she is in fact a pure blooded werewolf herself that a so called 'dark prince' werewolf kane hodder wants to mate with her create a new breed of pure blood werewolves that will take over the entire world or something like that understandably josie has a hard time believing it that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes it's up to werewolf cop steve to save josie the day the world br br co executive produced directed richard friedman i thought darkwolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didn't really do anything for me the script by geoffrey alan holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show then there's a werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it's pretty much down hill all the way i'm afraid for a start it's slow going it's dull it's predictable it's populated with highly annoying character's who come out with lots of bad dialogue do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the werewolf they don't i have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead the script is dumb doesn't explain itself why has josie never turned into a werewolf before is she really the only one why can't this 'dark prince' find another female werewolf there are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about half way through but you get the idea anyway as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the least br br director friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original doesn't really improve the film as a spectacle now let's talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in darkwolf are far from special the werewolf transformation is achieved using cgi it's among the worst looking cgi i've ever seen seriously a playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics it's easily the worst werewolf transformation i've ever seen an american werewolf in london 1981 was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally light years ahead of the ones seen in darkwolf who says special effects have improved over the years the animatronic puppet effects aren't much better either although at least there's something psychical on screen the gore isn't up to much after a gory opening kill there's some blood splatter plenty of dead bodies but not much else thre's a fair amount of female nudity if that's your thing but don't get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it is it really worth it br br technically darkwolf is alright apart from possibly the worst cgi effect ever it's reasonably well made it at least seems to have production values the acting is what you'd expect really br br darkwolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves clutter the schedules of obscure cable tv stations i didn't think it was as bad as some but it's like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said done they're both horrible still
<START> the brothers quay are directors judging by conventional thought should have stuck to making short films i myself actually really liked their first feature institute benjamenta but judging by their sophomore effort the piano tuner of earthquakes i'm willing to agree they don't come close to equaling their past genius at feature length piano tuner is without a doubt a gorgeous film to look at and often to listen to unfortunately it's borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace reading the plot synopsis it sounds like a pretty good story but the brothers fail miserably to bring it to life one thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future dialogue my god it's awful here a huge bust
<START> this would be the worst film i'd ever seen hmmm ok maybe tied with boogeyman then awful truly awful br br i had low expectations and it failed to meet them i honestly cant think of one good thing so here are the worst points br br 1 the acting 2 the plot 3 the cgi xbox 360 has better graphics seriously 4 the plot 5 the dialogue and finally 6 the plot br br there are so many unanswered questions did they make a 2 32 hour long movie then realize they hadn't put lex luthor and superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than superman's son and the henchman he kills br br was half the budget spent on persuading kevin spacey to do it br br when superman goes to hospital why don't the doctors ask what the f do you want us to do he's a f ing alien we don't know jack about his anatomy br br what happened in the 5 years superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years br br where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie br br and finally why just why br br btw for those of you wondering how come superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite i think i've figured it out br br since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks it is clearly all in his head therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock br br either that or the writers are slack jawed half wits who didn't think that was a fairly obvious mistake
<START> as a popular sport surfing was liked by many people just after watched the documentary i realized how dangerous it could be in fact the surfers also scared of big waves even somebody got killed by it but they still kept on surfing and enjoyed themselves only brave people can do it br br according to what the surfers said we can clearly knew what they felt when the big wave came at them you have to adjust to your best and avoid direct strike from the big wave when you win it that will obviously bring you huge satisfaction br br the amazing cinematography cannot be overlooked that is absolutely visual enjoyment br br an excellent sports documentary 8 10
<START> wow this movie was so horrible i'm so glad i didn't have to pay money to see this horrible movie it was like a history nut went on a coke binge the previews of it made it look decent but it was really bad i will say the idea sounded decent but come on it was really really bad if u sat down and thought about it you would also realize it was unrealistic come on back in the day u think they had all that stuff to work with it wasn't like ben franklin sat down one day and made a damn riddle it was completely ridiculous and it you want to see a bad movie then by all means go see this one all and all horrible movie it might actually be on my top 10 worst films i've ever seen
<START> i am so glad that i got a chance to see this rare little gem of a movie i saw it at an independent film festival so don't expect it to come to your town anytime soon during the film i noticed about 10 people get up and walk out too bad for them down here in the south folks don't like having to read subtitles the movie starts out slow but is so rich in dialogue that i never felt bored when the action finally arrives i found myself glued to the screen as if i were riding a roller coaster br br i also got a big kick of the chapter titles appearing before the chapters especially the ones that introduce the characters as they appear on screen it reminded me of zelda ocarina of time when you face level bosses br br if this is the future of video game comic book movies then i welcome it
