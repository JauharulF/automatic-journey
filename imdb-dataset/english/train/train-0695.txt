<START> had some lovely poetic bits but is really just an artsy fartsy toss together with no direction or resolution how do these people get through film school who gives them money to make this crap could have been so much more fine lead actor and i always like fairuza balk but come on the alt rock metaphor of just staring vacantly unable to find anything compelling is just so tired and it sure doesn't make for good films the director needs to go away and live life for a good long while and not come back to the camera until they really have something to say this is like the throw spaghetti at the wall school of art making just juxtapose a bunch of earnest imagery and hope hope hope like hell that poetry emerges that can work if the director actually has any kind of vision or has a brain that knows when it's in the presence of potential but here it's just space filler of no consequence i felt the lazy ending coming moments before it hit and was yelling you lazy bastard at the screen when the credits popped up
<START> i watched this film a long time ago aprox 10 years or so and liked it then i remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again the second time around was not pleasant the acting is 'so so' the plot is illogical unreasonable and predictable br br the acting i'm sure it wasn't a stretch for those actresses to play those characters the plot there's no way in hell those women would have gotten away with the first robbery much less the 2nd side note why did tt not realise that even if she came up with a load of money for her court date they would ask where she got it and she would have no logical answer ding ding we have a crook it horribly stereotyped black women in saying basically that the only way black women can 'beat the system' or obtain a large amount of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources it plays too much on sympathy b c all of them die in the end bar jada but it's not sad you're thinking 'they were so stupid they deserve to die you just don't really care about the characters unless you're a shallow person br br i can't believe this film rates over a 5
<START> i have always had the philosophy that every single human being has different tastes i found this movie to be awesome and i think every college student out there might agree with me notwithstanding this is not a movie with a plot its about real guys and some of the problems that they face i found the movie hilarious especially the parts that they played the practical jokes on each other simply put if you are in the same wave length as these people you will find this movie amazing i don't think that this is going win any golden globes or oscars or that the people in this movie will become future hollywood stars but its a kind of cult classic among young people who could relate to their experience for me the guy that stands out the most is hans the scandinavian guy who according to him isnt a looker but gets all or some of the chicks the little people also play a big part in the movie especially when they are drunk if i keep going i might provide a spoiler and i don't want to do that just go and get the movie and you will not regret i give it a 8 10
<START> i liked it just that i liked it not like the animated series i love it the fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate but this cartoon was awesome but it really didn't like it that much there's too much people talking about bruce being so cold but if this is around 5 years later anybody in a crime fighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude so to me it isn't a flaw batgirl was awesome she really fit there as there isn't more dick grayson as a robin batman needed a good teammate not like the new robin he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child but heres what didn't work the new artwork it isn't horrible but to me it does'nt work in a series like batman this is a dark character with a maniac killer like the joker so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon the joker isn't a bad design but i still like the past joker but to me the best joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyond return of the joker so this joker isn't near as good the good thing about the joker is that it still mark hamil voice my favorite character harley quinn im in love for her they put an awesome episode for her mad love to me the best episode of this series here we finally know how she turned harley quinn and how the joker twisted her mind and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series darker no happy ending brutal fight with the joker but too short this is how it was to be all the series but in general i didn't like how she made harley in this series in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way she get punched she say nonsenses she make flaws c'mon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her not from her and here they put ridiculous like i said the only episode where i don't think that its in mad love and beware of the creeper so in general its a good series it has it upsides and downs the drawn could be better my good kill that catwoman nice sound effects nice music nice voices and nice episodes my favorites mad love jokers millions old wounds sins of the father and cold comfort if you enjoyed batman tas you can watch this but don't spec too much in the other hand if you didn't watched tas watch this first and then watch tas in that way you're really gonna love tas d
<START> i saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless an ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas the victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man they drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or duh burn him quentin alias mr fabersham of the honeymooners is married to diane brewster alias miss canfield of leave it to beaver fame who is unhappy in marriage wow love plot the rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid the egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film where is the mummy really just a curse unleashed this does not hold a torch to universal mummy films in the least watch this movie if you need sleep because you will dose off
<START> american icon henry fonda portrays elegant john howard an aging trucker who has had his beloved big rig eleanor repossessed after a lengthy hospital stay has forced him to miss his payments deciding that he would like to make just one more perfect run he breaks out of the hospital steals back eleanor and hooks up with old friend penelope pearson eileen brennan who is in need of relocating her troupe of prostitutes br br fondas' wonderful performance is a natural anchor for a film that tugs at the heartstrings as effectively as it tickles the funny bone in the more comedic scenes a superb cast including robert englund as a reluctant young sidekick susan sarandon who also gets co producer credit and dub taylor a delightful ham as always in the most blatantly comedic portion of the picture helps immeasurably br br the ultimately life affirming nature of the picture and the poignancy of the journey carry incredible weight this is a picture that provided you get into it you can remember long after it's over br br the promise of the open road is vividly displayed here the countryside just looks beautiful set to craig safans' wonderful music score it's a remarkable picture in terms of aesthetics br br it loses a little something in its final act the characters played by john byner and austin pendleton are little more than intrusions but it still maintains its good vibes thanks to the appeal of its central characters br br not at all the exploitation drive in schlock picture one might expect from the title especially its alternate title the great smokey roadblock it's a rewarding movie experience that i can recommend without qualms br br 9 10
<START> i got lured by the title i was expecting an insightful and intriguing journey into alcoholism instead i got a rather boring and uninspiring story about a rowdy scot br br the leading character isn't given much psychological depth unless you are willing to classify cheesy teen like poetry as psychology br br it was a shame because the core of the story could have been good with a better effort to depict the inner feelings of a man who had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth br br sadly the general idea seems to be more like i'm the way i am because that's the way i am and the laughingly bad attempt at giving some sort of poetic edge to a lower class man makes things even worse resorting to the overused clichÃ© of the poÃ¨te maudit reeks of a quick fix a cheap way to make a dull movie seem smart artsy and meaningful br br but 16 years of alcohol isn't much smart artsy or meaningful the leading character doesn't evolve at all and the feeble attempt of changing fails without a good explanation just like the initial attempt happened rather out of the blue br br the movie borrows heavily from classics such as a clockwork orange and trainspotting but it ultimately fails to recapture their greatness not even for a few seconds br br jobson put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story and neglected the rest giving us a movie which is pleasant to the eye but insipid to the brain
<START> i suggested renting this movie to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the film and he said it was okay i thought the title was a bit campy since the version at our store was called the fear halloween night i expected this movie to be somewhat of a halloween rip off with a killer wooden guy but it opened with a good scene and the killer murdered two victims immediately and flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two people including his mother and he even witnessed his fathers suicide is going to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his fathers spirit pretty good for a sequel and i never even seen the first
<START> hey guys i'm actually in this movie i didn't even know it was on this site until i looked a few years ago and i was so surprised i played pete the main characters son it was a great experience and i loved every minute of it while filming they needed me to be in two places at once so they used my twin sister as a body double the finger that pushes the radio button in the car is hers not mine i still act and do some tv but not as much oh and if you want proof my name is the first one at the top of the scroll br br review i thought the movie was okay but if i wasn't in it it wouldn't be one of my favorites i thought the acting was really good but the story line was only so so
<START> merry madcaps in london stage a treasure hunt with one young woman inadvertently fixing up her married politician father with a strong independent lady flier who's never been in love intriguing early vehicle for katharine hepburn playing an amelia earhart like aviatrix who's been too self involved to give herself over to any man the director dorothy arzner and the screenwriter zoe akins who adapted gilbert frankau's book were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view but why are all the old clichÃ©s kept intact like frozen artifacts billie burke plays the type of simpering weepy wife who takes to her bed when thing go wrong and hepburn's final scene is another bummer a curious artifact but not a classic for kate watchers from
<START> the first home alone was a decent enough film the sequel was pretty much the same at a new setting this one tries to be original and succeeds to some degree of course the formula is basically the same so it's like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot the new score is quite bad though the new setting traps piece was if nothing else interesting and different especially compared to the grand score of the first and the almost but not quite as good score of the second it almost makes up for it by using some pretty good non original music but it's just not the same the plot is fair and somewhat original to the franchise but it's still basically the same movie as the first two with worse acting and a less impressive example of the 'scary character turning out to be good' the acting is mostly unimpressive the characters are mostly caricatures the new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones and they make fun of spy stuff which is almost criminal given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are and how precious few of them are cool the fact that there are more of them and thereby more traps is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films and it doesn't work the idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too adult and serious for a children's film and there was a sexual joke or two though that isn't the first time in the series it's also unnecessarily complex as is the plot in general i could follow it but i doubt a kid could some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid the animal stuff is generally not amusing there are fewer siblings which should mean that those there are get developed more but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films all in all just not particularly good or worth watching unless you really love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon y violence i recommend this to huge fans of the series only 3 10
<START> before i begin you need to know that i am a huge fan of many of sonny chiba's films his biographical series of the life of his master mas oyama were amazing and among the best martial arts films ever made as were most of his street fighter films the action was practically non stop and with the possible exception of bruce lee depending on who you ask he was the greatest martial arts practitioner on film during the 1970s because they are so good i've seen at least 15 of his films and recently bought some more which i am in the process of watching br br unfortunately despite my love of these films i am not a mind numbed zombie who worships the man to such a degree that i rate every film a 10 there are a few reviews like this here on imdb and i truly think that anyone giving this film a 10 should be ignored because this is such a bad film from a technical standpoint and isn't even close to the being chiba's best work a score of 10 isn't a real rating it's some zombie fan trying to make a statement about chiba not this film as i said technically this film is awful some of this was the result of my seeing the american dubbed version with its irrelevant prologue and bad dubbing but most of the problem would still exist with the original japanese print the camera work is simply atrocious like it was done by chimps smart chimps but still chimps nonetheless often much of the fast martial arts action is missed because the camera is so slow or the tops of the actors heads are clipped off due to the shoddiness of production and again and again the camera pans in and out like it is a new toy being used by an idiot plus the editing is beyond wretched with cuts being done haphazardly and confusingly br br i don't know whether the musical score is original or not but it was also very very bad sort of like acid rock of 1970 blended poorly with ennio morricone's spaghetti western music it was annoying distracting and just plain silly br br as for the martial arts action i think that having chimps do the choreography would have improved things a bit instead of the great fight scenes you'd look forward to in a chiba film the fights are too brief and often missed by the camera so what you are left with is the story and this might just be the worst part of the film it's supposed to be an anti drug film starring sonny chiba as sonny chiba and when the film begins he vows to destroy the drug trade in japan but the mafia complete with not a single member who looks italian but who are all japanese vows to stop chiba and when a lady comes to chiba with promises to give him information about how to destroy the drug trade he agrees to help her and risk his life with no conditions even though she's never forthright about telling him what she knows in fact later it turns out she is just trying to use chiba to protect her while she herself sells a huge briefcase full of cocaine and he continues trying to protect her this makes no sense at all and throughout much of the film it looks as if they just shot the film without a script such as when they went into the bars and brothels and had chiba walking about as if he was drunk br br so if it was that bad why still does it merit a 3 well first there are many more horrid marital arts films such as many of those from hong kong in the 1970s including one with guys dressed up in gorilla suits doing kung fu and their handlers with 3 foot long tongues they used for fighting now that's bad second while the action is very bad compared to other sonny chiba films compared to its contemporaries it's not that bad still you could easily do a lot better than this horrid little film br br by the way if you are wondering if this is the worst sonny chiba film it certainly is not in one of his first films invasion of the neptune men chiba plays a leotard wearing super hero who battles pointy headed invaders from the planet neptune it's so bad that it rivals plan 9 from outer space and they saved hitler's brain for awfulness br br a final note to parents like most of sonny chiba's films this one is very violent and has its share of boobies don't let little kids watch this no matter how much they beg make them wait until they are older before you let them watch wretched rated r martial arts films
<START> this movie has no story it's only about a bunch of guys who tortures an innocent young girl to death br br spoilers br br this is what they do they beat her put her in a net and let her hang inside like birdfood spin her around on a chair until she pukes expose her to loud noise pour boiling oil on her put worms in her sores crush her hand with a sledge hammer and finally pokes a needle through her eye br br this movie was so realistic that if i didn't know it was fake i would have thought it was a snuff movie although i was disgusted by this movie i really liked it it scared me i guess it fills some kind of purpose i give it a 10 10
<START> this is simply one of the finest renditions of dicken's classic tale the script very accurately follows the story originally penned by dickens and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choice br br george c scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of scrooge and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts i found that he was able to win me over to the point where i sympathized with the old miser something rarely done in other versions the superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production which is simply the most enjoyable of all the christmas carol versions i have seen
<START> this film was the first british teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society rather than being a lucid parody of 1950s teenage life in an attempt to celebrate the work of liverpool's junior liaison officers the opening title points out that 92 of potential delinquents who have been dealt with under this scheme have not committed a second crime however this becomes merely a pretext to the following teen drama until the film's epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldn't feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixed up they might seem br br stanley baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of juvenile liaison officer this hard boiled character is a role typical of baker having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer however as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events back to his original investigation br br his first case leads him to the home of two young children mary and patrick murphy played by real life brother and sister duo who have committed a petty theft here he meets cathie satisfyingly portrayed by anne heywood their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with it quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such inner city estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency br br the elder brother of the murphy family johnny is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums mccallum does an eye catching turn as the americanized mixed up kid who owes more to the likes of marlon brando than any previous british star one is reminded of brando's character johnny from 'the wild one' who led a leather clad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this film's 'johnny' leads his gang br br thankfully the preachiness of earlier dearden crime dramas such as 'the blue lamp' is not so apparent instead we are presented with several well drawn out characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between heywood and baker takes the forefront br br the plot whilst at times predictable does deliver some memorable scenes the disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where johnny abandons himself to the music leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant the most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children including mary and patrick are held hostage at gunpoint by johnny obviously in the light of the real life dumblaine massacre this scene seems all the horrifying understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences
<START> trigger man is definitely the most boring and silliest movie i've ever seen in my life my aunt's holiday videos are more fascinating br br the actors seem to be recruited at uglypeople com they do not have any talent to act in a convincing manner br br they walk and walk and walk through the forest there's more walking around than in all three parts of the lord of the rings together after the first hour i began to read a porsche brochure while watching trigger man along the way awful br br a total waste of time and money i'd give that movie 0 stars out of 10 since this is not possible i have to give 1 star
<START> it would require the beauty and eloquence of shakespeare to do justice to this outstanding cinematic feat nevertheless i'll give it a go br br as far as adaptations of hamlet go this one is already at a better starting point than all other versions since it encompasses the entire play still this is no guarantee for a first rate movie or even a good one usually i'm not much for movies that are overlong and the trend that seems to be prevalent in hollywood today namely that movies should be at least two hours long preferably three is one that hopefully won't last long few stories are strong enough to withstand such extensive exploration and could do with some cutting making a four hour long movie and keeping it interesting is no small undertaking but kenneth branagh pulls it off with flying colours he has managed to make a very long movie seem no more than any average movie i was completely engrossed from start to finish br br the cast is excellent with kenneth branagh himself as the tormented prince giving a strong and memorable performance he manages to convey his feelings admirably through his voice and one does not have to be an expert on shakespearean verse to catch the myriad of emotions that are waging inside him kate winslet was a positive surprise i must say i didn't know what to expect really i've always liked her well enough as an actor but wasn't sure she could pull off playing shakespeare well she certainly eradicated all doubts with her performance she is the best ophelia i have seen and lent such depth to the character and was simply wonderful other brilliant performances are derek jacobi as claudius richard briers as polonius and nicholas farrell as horatio to name but a few i liked the fact that branagh used some internationally more famous stars to play in some of the minor roles i especially enjoyed the sparring between hamlet and the gravedigger played by billy crystal br br the setting of the play in the 19th century gives a welcome change to the usually gloomier gothic settings it is overall much lighter than other versions i've seen more colourful and lavish but this does not distract from the tragedy of the play it is exceptional stylish and aesthetically pleasing a definite delight to the eye and other senses as well the music by patrick doyle is as always magical and thoroughly in tune with the movie one can only feel a deep sense of satisfaction after having seen this i am shocked and appalled that this exquisite work of art did not win an academy award for best picture even more so that it wasn't even nominated there is no way there was a better movie made that year or any other year for that matter this is as close to perfection as you can hope to get br br to sum up a stunning work of pure genius and i cannot see how anyone could top this my hat's off to you mr branagh
<START> a huge hit upon release with australian audiences it can still be funny today but its over the top political incorrectness and blunt unsubtle humour can make it a bit of a cringer it goes on far too long some of br br the content could have been saved for the sequel barry mckenzie holds his own which desperately needed some new stuff anyway granted his ocker aussie attitude is funny but also becomes annoying as the film drags on some say crocker's songs are the best bits and they are certainly original but hilarious the adventures of barry mckenzie will go down as a landmark in australian cinema but we should do everything in our power to make sure that overseas audiences do not see the majority of australians as barry mckenzies or for that matter mick dundees rating 5 10
<START> i never actually thought that a film could be so atrocious but alas i was wrong terrible acting terrible plot terrible effects the crocodile was awful and as for the stupid sex killing scene all in one that was a bad move from the word go it was truly shocking and that is not a compliment how can someone make this film watch it back and then actually say yeah thats a good movie people will watch that if you haven't seen it i beg you don't bother
<START> this is not an entirely bad movie the plot new house built next door seems to be haunted is not bad the mood is creepy enough and the acting is okay the big problem i had is that being familiar with lara flynn boyle from twin peaks and other shows i couldn't get over how different she looks with her apparently new big lips i kept staring at them they look so out of place on her face they make her look completely different and not better br br mark paul gosselaar the actor who plays kim the architect who designs and pours his heart and soul into the house does a fine job and lara as col is also quite good but those lips as the owner of the house next door her husband walker colin ferguson is appropriately wooden the various characters who live in the house were also fine i particularly liked pie charlotte sullivan and her husband buddy stephen amell the first people to move into the house the attempt to involve us in the overall neighborhood vibe fails unfortunately as the other neighbors are not particularly likable br br for some reason the director was unable to make the haunted house particularly ominous other movies such as amityville horror the legend of hell house manage to achieve that spooky feel but it just doesn't happen here the closest is when col paints a depiction of the house br br another thing that didn't work for me is the plot twist that occurs with kim the architect initially he appears to be a victim of the house like the others it has sucked him dry of inspiration but later he seems to have joined forces with it in evil br br overall not a bad movie for horror fans if you can take your eyes off those big lips
