<START> the movie is pretty funny and involving for about four dates then it becomes a blatant commercial for some guy you and even his friends really can't stand it is a pretty interesting concept film dates on a quest to find true love in modern la the problem is that it feels incredibly and badly scripted at times and blatantly self promoting it is difficult to care about and be drawn into any of the characters because the writer actor is so egotistical uncool untrue and simply unlikeable you end up feeling sorry for his dates
<START> i recently watched the first guinea pig film the devil's experiment and i must admit to being disappointed br br this film is invariably included in any list of the nastiest films and maybe i was expecting more because of the hype the truth is though i don't rate it br br if i'd been watching it believing the opening text to be true i found this tape i might have been a bit disturbed by it thinking it was real even without the benefit of knowing it not to be real though i think i'd have worked out that it indeed wasn't br br throughout the film the girl's reactions to what is being done to her just aren't what they should be she should be screaming like a banshee in pain the fact that she isn't means that it's obviously not real i wouldn't want to watch it if it were real but if she were to be more convincing in her acting the film would be more disturbing br br and then there are the notorious scenes nothing affected me at all up until the scalpel in the hand the hot oil maggots and innards just didn't bother me i'm not saying i'm hard just that i wasn't able to suspend my disbelief partly because of the girl's inaction br br the scalpel made me wince a little but the hammer to the hand just made the hand look rubber and the final scene with the eye was again a little wincing but nothing more i didn't want to look away and neither did i feel nauseous br br perhaps it's because the film is twenty odd years old or perhaps i'm just jaded the truth is i didn't find this film at all disturbing br br it's the kind of thing you might expect to see playing on a loop as a modern art installation and as an exercise in stripping away characters story etc and just leaving the torture it works on some levels as a disturbing piece of film though it didn't work for me at least br br i watched guinea pig with my wife who is of the it's just a film bent and she wondered what all the fuss was about we got to discussing why i watch these films and my reasons are many but include a desire to be affected by a film she said that she didn't think any film could be so convincing as to disturb her and challenged me to do exactly that i played her the fire extinguisher scene from irreversible and she was indeed disturbed br br i'm not sure i have a point other than that both of us were more disturbed by a scene in a non horror genre film than any film thus far which sets out to disturb
<START> some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not a bad film but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title liam neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more
<START> i watched this movie last night and was a bit disappointed a lot of the time facts were off at the beginning of the movie the grandfather made a comment to this grandson and his friends about how they felt when 9 11 hit this movie was supposed to be taking place in 1994 also one of the grandsons friends was wearing an eagles donovan mcnabb jersey he hadn't even been drafted as of yet the story line was good but the facts and actuality of the time frame was so far off base that it made the movie seem cheesy my boyfriend is an avid reader of wwii books and memorabilia i rented this movie hoping that it would be good the acting was so so the dog was cute but the way that this movie was carried out made me glad that i only paid 4 dollars to rent it as opposed to the 50 it would have taken me to watch it in a theater i hope that who ever reads this understands that i mean no discontent to those who fought the war but the facts and time frame should have been a little more closely monitored
<START> first of all i would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called the flying dutchman in this film you will not see a single sailing boat you will not see sailors ghosts or anything remotely exciting it is not the story of the ghost ship and i wish they had notified it in the main credits or i wouldn't have watched it because i really thought it was the film about the legend it seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship since the film is listed on the wikipedia page for the flying dutchman legend i don't understand why it is maybe based on the resembling legend called the wandering jew or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend the film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes unfortunately it is the only battle scene of the film then you see daniel emilfork who was krank in city of lost children for about two seconds and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting unfortunately he is very bad in the film the same thing can be said about italian actor nino manfredi who was one of italia's best actors ever and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the wise man of the film and boy does that film need wiseness every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement yelling torturing others in excrement fornicating in excrement or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it it seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another coming from a dutch director you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece elements which contributed to make dutch filmmaker paul verhoeven's film flesh blood such a great film the thought of flesh blood would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight forward would be good unfortunately and unlike flesh blood there is no dramatic progression no fights no good acting and put simply no flesh and blood the photography as the opening sequence unfolds is well done and enticing this too stops very early in the film the music from nicola piovani of la vitÃ  e bella fame is repetitive and annoying when not irrelevant it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung throughout the first act of the film which lasts nothing less than an hour the film takes place within the same perimeter which is around the farm where the main characters live the characters play with excrement a lot drown in it play in it a long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character a young boy who loves to play in excrement to become older and play in excrement some more the bird man talks a lot to say foolish things in italian spanish conquistadors speak french nothing makes sense everything is confused and takes hours to happen then there is a second act called the ship in which we see what might have been a ship a long time ago but which is now remains of a ship covered with excrement did i mention the main character while walking a bit further away from the farm just happens to run into it and decides it's really cool so let's live in it the hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him but he doesn't really mind because did i mention he's not very bright he thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it until more conquistadors show up at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the don quixote style hats but as i've said it's really confused who's who make the dutchman a prisoner along with the retarded hunchback and they burn the ship to the ground the last part of the film which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle age peasants fighting in it takes place in a mad asylum yet more torture and drowning each other with feces yet more loitering for the director who seems to have definitely given up on his job or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job in the end a lot of the mentally challenged new friends that the dutchman made die the woman he had sex with who was his brother's wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son the dutchman and his son talk the film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they don't have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses
<START> in conception a splendid film investigating the tensions that occur in family life in the idyllic setting of galiano island off the coast of british columbia the lotus eaters is marred by the fact that it has been packaged as a made for tv movie diminishing itself throughout by the addition of chirpy music over potentially powerful scenes as if to get ready for the interruption of commercials a pity really
<START> is this the movie is this what indians are trying to show i think this is one more effort from a sick minded director to turn down pakistani soldiers and in fact country but what we pakistani's know that we are always ahead of india in every part of our lives not only in armed counters br br well this is bad filmed as that of border in early 1997 and director and writer just tried to overcome a shame of defeat in kargil by pakistani armed forces by creating films like these br br one thing is very clear whenever there will be an encounter between pakistan and india we will win so mr dutta try to make some good movies instead of nonsense movies like this
<START> i read thru most of the comments posted here all i can say it that most of these posters have major problems in life this show unlike most game show was fun mr shatner whose brill in all that he does was again the hit of the show he's genuinely bubbly personality shines like a beacon where ever he goes he's fun makes you smile that's exactly what the show does also the dancers questions the round about fashion they're presented only add to the shows appeal and even though there's a great deal of money at stake it's fun the pressure stress that exists in most game shows does not exist here several people who posted messages complained how much time is waisted with the dancers choosing questions c like millionaire doesn't have similar time wasters all i can say is most of you have missed the whole concept the idea here is to have fun enjoy yourself there's something for everyone qustions to test your knowledge eye candy the dancers suspense mr shatner's wonderful fun filled personality well if that doesn't perk up guys up then i feel bad for you and if that's not enough you can get rich i really miss the show out of all the games shows that have ever been on to be quite frank i hate game shows this is the one i really liked truly miss the only other game show i ever liked was match game
<START> if you have any clue about jane austenÂ´s production youÂ´ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels marriage marriage and marriage in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring but i like austenÂ´s characters because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in emma the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow sheÂ´s very good in her leading role also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie donÂ´t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious
<START> ok i have watched the original french version but i can't imagine this being better with subtitles br br all i have to say that this is the most boring movie i have seen in a long time there are almost no redeeming qualities to this film that's why i can't understand all the positive reviews it might be realistic in a sense but some real stories are best left untold br br i usually like slow paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie tarkovsky's solaris is extremely slow paced but it allows introspection and sets the mood of the film for example but in this case the movie is just filed with mindless dialog that manage to tell us little about the characters none of which i could identify with or care for in a lot of the scenes i found myself thinking when are they going to shut up the acting was pretty bad not in an overacting obvious kind of way but it seems none of the actors cared about their characters and they all looked like they wanted to be elsewhere in most of the scenes this might be due to the uninspired dialog they were given also the whole flow of the movie felt quite mechanical going from one scene to the next it seems this movie was just written badly but never directed br br this is one of the few films that i can say generated no emotional response from any of the scenes no suspense no fear no anticipation no sorrow no introspection no intellectual stimulation no interest what so ever br br a perfect example of what i call an anti movie
<START> like most of the festivals entries hamiltons makes for an interesting watch a film thats all ideas and little execution although impressive for it's obvious low budget the film falters in it's final twist and becomes dreadfully long during it's drawn out and obvious conclusion the film is about a family of murderous outcasts trying to survive after there parents have died they kidnap people drain the blood from them and feed something locked away in their basement there's some nice darkly humorous performances from mckellhar and firgens and the rest are just so so the film never feels realistic or very disturbing for that matter but for the first half taps into an oddly humorous and dark mixture which is a surprising accomplishment the next half isn't so successful as it receeds into film oblivion with unrealistic twists into a ridiculously cocky finale that turns the entire film into utter crap it's a shame though there is no doubt that some talent was involved with this production and although deeply flawed it remains original and creative too bad that when it comes to the delivery it completely fails on every level br br 5
<START> midnight cowboy is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason it really is one of the finest films ever made in america its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial no wonder it was a huge success when initially released but be warned its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made the characters are memorable well developed and ultimately tragic the filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the hollywood ending something which was basically mandatory by the 80s still this is why i treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for american film its a time when well made innovative and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that hollywood could offer all this was over by the time star wars was released br br the direction by john schlesinger makes the material work it combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects midnight cowboy has aged quite well its still as powerful now as it was when initially released the acting however is what makes this a masterpiece the characters' backgrounds are never fully explained but the performances make them completely developed both jon voight and dustin hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic despite their sometimes reprehensible actions plus being a fan of vintage exploitation films i loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street midnight cowboy is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made 10 10
<START> this has to be hands down hats off one of the most uproarious comedies ever made starting with the animated blowing popping bubbles the entrance to the daytime awards the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech the venomous comments uttered by the actor's jealous co stars and producer under phony smiles now that is only in the first few minutes then all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous ridiculous in a good way no make that a great way this was the first time i'd seen the always charming teri hatcher while i may not be a follower of desperate housewives she herself is always watchable same goes for lois clark not a huge follower but if i run across an episode i'd watch it robert downey jr does a great turn as slimy smarmy snaky sycophantic david seaton barnes the producer who'd give his right eye to see sally field's celeste talbert leave the show if only to finally get to get it on with cathy moriarty's montana moorehead br br moriarty absolutely shines in this movie just as she had everywhere else she's appeared here all she has to do is scream i hate you i hate you you creep or give one of her anti celeste co conspirators an evil grin and she has me rolling in the aisles yes cathy moriarty is a very gifted actress and one hell of a comedienne sally field gratefully departs from the usual 70 mm sized lifetime tragedy of the week movies and we're all reminded why she is who she is today having started off in comedy afraid of nothing her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor but like a caterpillar in a cocoon the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was the thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy serious roles that you associate them with their character and you can't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen br br how lucky were the producers to land carrie fisher if only for a glorified cameo she doesn't realize what a presence she bears on screen she takes a role which in the hands of a lesser actress could easily have been forgotten but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself br br how lucky was elisabeth shue to get thrown in the middle of all this at the time she wasn't really known for much adventures in babysitting was kind of cute yes i was dragged to an evening show for which i had to pay full price but she didn't hold my attention much but here she makes the most of her character star's niece who falls in love with the star's ex co star and lover who of course turns out to be the niece's father and the star turns out to be the poor girl's mother br br i'll stop there i feel i practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy or at least a novela if you've seen it then reminisce if you haven't you've missed a real classic but not really the dvd's are made of a material that'll last for at least 25 years and this movie is timeless so what the hell
<START> i love this movie but can't get what is in this movie tht is not to like people who don't like this movie must be richard roeper and roger ebert but i can't believe that is mr carrey behind all that makeup and i am sure that most of the actors and actresses in the movie has made film before this and there is a new face in the movie taylor momsen who plays cindy lou who as the opens the grinch jim carrey comes out of hiding and causes some mean fun to the whos in whoville sicne we know that the whos love christmas while the grinch does not like christmas and even makes fun of little cindy lou who taylor momsen who is the daughter of the town's postmaster bill irwin the movie was directed by ron howard and the narrtor's voice is done by anthony hopkins and jeffrey tambor muppets from space is cast as the mayor of whoville who doesn't like talking about the grinch close to christmas time
<START> this night listener is better than people are generally saying it has weaknesses and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis no doubt but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this the whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of plods alongÂno so there are no flashy endings or earth shattering revelations no showdown scenes thank heaven you have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionally good movie williams isn't terrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic no one as he is the everyman the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story toni collette's performance should be nominated for an oscar even if she maybe shouldn't win it give it a shot for quality and content alone the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days
<START> one of my favourite films it has everything rocking soundtrack courtesy of eddie clark ex motorhead loads of action loads of laughs totally ridiculous plot and the most wonderful '80's stereotypes as characters eddie the put upon nice guy who just wants to be left alone to be different leslie about as wet as they come nuke the rock burn out eddie's mom pathetic roger the geek and ozzy as the preacher surely he exists in america then there are the boys rich vicious and stupid and the girls vacant vain and stupid what more could you ask for br br well first of all there's sammi curr the rock star an amalgam of every '80's badass rocker you can think of what about that rocket firing guitar then there's the scene where sammi pulls the old lady through the tv screen and smashes her up and what does roger do why hoover her up just like a good geek would my favourite scene is where tim hainey gets his long overdue reward from sammi via the wet finger in the plug magic br br if you were into rock in the '80's or just love ridiculous films like i do then check this one out it's available on dvd and very cheap so trick or treat yourself
<START> this filmfour funded sci fi movie is most definitely a must see while it takes huge influence from the manchurian candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise it's handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive despite it being basically a re run of an earlier film it's good to know that films like this are still being made even if they aren't getting wide releases and cypher is refreshing for that reason the plot twists and turns which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of cypher's mystery the plot follows morgan sullivan a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons to him unknown however his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita br br this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it's apocalyptic imaging of the future this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type with it's only real close affiliate being kubrick's a clockwork orange the plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish and more thrilling plot developing you never quite know where you are with the plot which serves in making it all the more intriguing the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars jeremy northam and lucy lui northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale and does well with his role lucy lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn't quite fit her talent but she has a look about her that just fits this movie br br cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent but on the whole if you want an inventive recent sci fi film cypher is the way to go
<START> this a fascinatingly awful movie it make so little sense that it starts to make a kind of weird internal logic of its own well it would if it didn't keep darting off up side alleys until eventually floundering under the weight of its own indecisiveness the movie can't make up its mind whether it is a straight forward 'man turns into monster' flick like all those 1950s 'the incredible insert verb ing man' movies or a ghastly big business conspiracy theory movie or a mystical afterlife contact story or or what take your pick it's just a mess grotesquely over the top and firing off in all directions leaving loose ends flapping all over the place it was as if tobe hooper had been taking david lynch pills unfortunately he didn't take enough
<START> diane keaton gave an outstanding performance in this rather sad but funny story which involved quite a few young people and their deep dark secrets diane keaton natalie the family stone '05 who had an only daughter and loved her beyond words can describe she always called her and told her surrender dorothy which was an expression used in the 'wizard of oz' 1939 a sudden car accident occurs and natalie gets herself deeply involved with her daughter's friends and lovers as natalie investigates the more truths she finds out about herself and her real relationship with her daughter great film to view and enjoy especially all the good acting from all the supporting actors
<START> i voted excellent for how well the acting was not for the content it still gives me chills after reading the book then watching the movie two ex cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison during the ride the tension begins to mount as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation after the killers are done with their work at the farm the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend the blood curdling scream as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord really made my blood run cold and gave me chills that the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family robert blake was excellent in his portrayal of perry smith the book was also excellently written by truman capote
