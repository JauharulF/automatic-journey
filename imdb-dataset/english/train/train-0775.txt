<START> as a casual listener of the rolling stones i thought this might be interesting not so as this film is very 'of its age' in the 1960's to me someone born in the 1980's this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap but i am sure this film was not made for me but people who were active during th '60's i expected drugs galore with th stones i was disappointed it actually showed real life hard work in the studio so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film i have not seen any of the directors other films but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing sort of 'amatuerish' which gave a feeling like the tv show eurotrash badly directed tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value my only good opinion of this is that i didn't waste money on it it came free with a sunday paper
<START> no not really but this is a very good film indeed and is sadly a forgotten gem black and white suits the film br br straight forward formula a guy had the plague and the authorities have to track down everyone he came in contact with before they die br br very well directed and the acting is great richard widmark as the male lead is good but is completely over shadowed in the acting stakes by paul douglas as the police captain and jack palance never better than this and zero mostel as the baddies sadly palance went on to play similar characters in some really second rate gangster or war movies
<START> a terrible amateur movie director no not todd sheets his new friend and sister explore a cave the friend and sister fall in and get rescued meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their 'turf' whatever the heck that means this film and i use the term very loosely is so bad that it's well bad the humor is painfully unfunny the action merely sad now i've seen some atrociously awful 'horror' films in my time failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low budget films yet i still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this only for the most hardened maschocists amongst you but the rest run away fast br br my grade f
<START> in the bygone days of the catholic church a sin eater was an individual that through ritual would take the sins of a dying person upon themselves often these people were excommunicate or similar individuals who the church would not absolve thereby denying them entrance into heaven the sin eaters were seen as blasphemous circumventing the chruch's monopoly on redemption sex this up a bit with some overt supernatural mojo let the concept wander where it may and you have the order a movie that combines stigmata 's religious anti authoritarianism the x files ' paranormal investigation and the thorn birds ' sexual spirituality into an odd melange that sometimes works br br alex heath ledger is a rogue priest one of the last members of the order of the carolingians a semi heretical order of knowledge seeking demon fighting priests when alex's mentor is found dead under bizarre circumstances bishop driscoll peter weller sends alex to investigate tagging along are fellow carolingian thomas mark addy and mara shannyn sossman who was subject to one of alex's exorcisms a year prior the three go to rome to investigate and are drawn into a dark underworld of bizarre catholic heresy ominous prophecies demonic intrusions and a man claiming to be the last surviving sin eater benno furmann br br written and directed by brian helgeland who worked with the same principals on the scattershot and half hearted a knight's tale the film is an odd one and difficult to classify it wants to be several things at once supernatural thriller religious intrigue dramatic television pilot and only sometimes succeeds at any of them this isn't helped by the slow pace or the fact that most of the actors seem to be sleepwalking through their performances with occasional bursts of brilliance ledger in particular has a particularly stunning scene of despair in an otherwise monochromatic performance sossman however displayed the same disconnected performance that she's given in all of her films most notably in the rules of attraction br br the plot itself meanders back and forth between several different story arcs leading you to wonder which is the main one with each arc containing its share of red herrings large gaps of narrative appear to be lost between scenes at times which can be confusing for many but this is also one of the film's saving graces the structure of the film coupled by the fact that there is never a truly clear antagonist until the very end of the film forces the viewer to analyze and reason in a time when most films are blatantly obvious about everything the exception to this is historical background on the carolingians and the practice of sin eating both of which are explained in dry exposition even at the beginning of the film character relationships and history are inferred instead of explained combine this with the on location shooting and judicious use of special effects and you have a very old world supernatural thriller with even the opening credits reminiscent of something from the late 70's early 80's br br a brief mention here as well for the subtle and organic score by david torn a combination of minimalist orchestration and lisa gerrard style exotic vocals a very nice score that is evocative without being bombastic and exists in a very deceptive simplicity br br a confusing plot a lack of purpose and sometimes sleepy performances would often damn a movie but for some reason the order remains watchable many people will be very turned off by the movie for its odd sensibilities and some may even become angry that they are forced to engage the higher functions of their brain to understand it still the film's sheer intangibility will prevent it from being either a critical or commercial success until the dvd which i'm sure will be stocked with copious amounts of deleted scenes a recommended film only for people who like to think while they watch 6 out of 10
<START> i remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 loved it then about 4 years later i had the privilege of seeing luciano pavarotti sing at the metropolitan opera house in new york in tosca so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night what's not to like about this film the music is brilliant and pavarotti fini was at his best and still looked great the story is actually very funny in parts the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest i have ever seen the hot air balloon flight over the napa valley was beautiful so was the song he sang if we were in love one of the few times pavarotti sang in english and hearing the duet of santa lucia gorgeous get real folks this was a film about an opera singer called georgio fini who just happened to be played by pavarotti kathryn harrold eddie albert were excellent in their supporting roles br br i am very glad that i still have this almost worn out vhs tape of this movie but i would love this to be released on dvd especially now that pavarotti is no longer with us because i think this includes the best performance of nessun dorma sung by him still on film today
<START> the pallbearer is a disappointment and at times extremely boring with a love story that just doesn't work partly with the casting of gwyneth paltrow julie gwyneth paltrow walks through the entire film with a confused look on her face and its hard to tell what david schwimmer even sees in her br br however the pallbearer at times is funny particularly the church scene and the group scenes with his friends are a laugh but that's basically it watch the pallbearer for those scenes only and fast forward the rest trust me you aren't missing much
<START> after a few lean years 1968 was a pretty swell time for elvis not only did he make that celebrated comeback tv special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well Â speedway and live a little love a little therefore personally i can forgive him for the misstep that was stay away joe which at best emerges as an interesting misfire and is not all that bad considering sure burgess meredith and joan blondell are indeed embarrassing Â as respectively a dopey indian father to elvis' character and a bawdy bartender who has her eye on mr presley too but one is glad to see elvis surrounded by top veteran hollywood talent like katy jurado as meredith's mexican wife the two jones Â henry and l q and thomas gomez who is particularly amusing as sarcastic chief thundercloud who is meredith's stubborn father still donning his old chieftain clothes in the present day br br while there is a surprising if not unwelcome given their usual blandness lack of songs there seems to be no shortage of free for all parties were the male indians hit the bottle steadily while presley practices his womanizing skills behind their backs as can be expected the typically 'western' arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy snoring bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point on the other hand the climactic 'destruction of the house' episode is one we've seen too often since and doesn't work too well here
<START> they should have named this movie blonde women that needed to get their roots colored also the main character geeze the too tight sweaters the giggling thought the guy did a good job though i keep hoping we'll find a good 8 star christmas movie to watch this week the dart throwing had to laugh at that too we've still got 3 more on the dvr to watch maybe we'll get lucky oh yeah i figured the guy out pretty quickly and nailed it when he picked up the flowers and then drove out with his cousin i told my daughter they were on their way to the cemetery and how stupid was it that the two gals followed them there spying on them creepy
<START> beyond the fact crazy people exist and there are religious nuts out there br br the characters basically make no sense most of the time br br the film has no real beginning middle or ending nor is anything ever explained much br br the film opens with a young man with the unlikely name of hazel motes apparently returning from a stint in the army br br he hitches a ride to a two story house that is in extreme disrepair windows boarded over he goes in the house walks around and finally writes a note that he leaves there this scene comes to nothing and we learn nothing further about the house or its history br br it is never explained exactly whose house this is or where the people have gone but we are given the impression hazel has probably lived there at one time br br hazel decides to go to a city why we don't know once he arrives in this city he writes down a name address that he sees on a bathroom wall and goes to visit this woman who is a surprisingly fat hooker he sees her for awhile and then he apparently isn't seeing her anymore like everything else in this movie it comes to nothing and serves no purpose br br a young man named enoch tries to befriend him but hazel really isn't interested although they keep crossing paths br br enoch is about as crazy as you can get one of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimps are and talk at them insultingly br br we never really know why enoch behaves as he does or why hazel behaves as he does beyond the fact hazel had an overdose of old time scary fundamentalist religion via his grandfather br br enoch later becomes enthralled with a man who dresses in a gorilla suit and manages to get the gorilla suit from him and then runs around in it br br hazel who is wound rather tight and seems to be in a constant borderline rage does a bit of street preaching i got the impression he was trying to free himself from the untruths of the religion that had been drilled into him br br he has several encounters with a preacher and his daughter although their interactions never really make any particular point and there is no plot line br br eventually hazel succumbs to complete religious fervor and begins self harming br br it is a very odd film interesting in it's oddness but other than that it has absolutely nothing going for it br br the cast does an outstanding job but this film completely fails to deliver either a point of view or a storyline br br the film also has the characters tossing around the n word from time to time with no connection to the rest of the dialog br br 2 stars
<START> this movie was like a bad train wreck as horrible as it was you still had to continue to watch my boyfriend and i rented it and wasted two hours of our day now don't get me wrong the acting is good just the movie as a whole just enraged both of us there wasn't anything positive or good about this scenario after this movie i had to go rent something else that was a little lighter jennifer tilly is as usual a very dramatic actress her character seems manic and not all there darryl hannah though over played she does a wonderful job playing out the situation she is in more than once i found myself yelling at the tv telling her to fight back or to get violent all in all very violent movie not for the faint of heart
<START> beautifully filmed well acted tightly scripted suspense movie had me on the edge of my seat i liked the lead actress very much and thought the villain was very well done not much to chew on here in the way of a theme but if you just get in your seat turn your brain off watch the fancy camera work and enjoy the plot you will have a great time the plot is well worn and regular movie goers will probably know more or less what to expect by about ten minutes in but that didn't bother me as i enjoyed watching it unfold in the old days they might not have focused so tightly on just two characters and there were some enticing moments when i hoped they were going to let some other people have a few lines but these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused the plot got me by the throat fairly early on and never let go it's not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie as i'm not sure it makes a great deal of sense just sit back and enjoy
<START> this is absurd aside from the fellow australian who has reviewed this flick i can't help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of elektra considering how generous they were with their praise br br admittedly i'm not really a fan of comic book to movie conversions so i didn't go in with many expectations yet still i found elektra to be incredibly underwhelming the thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was so much in this film which went by unexplained that left you thinking huh what relevance does that have to the plot or so how did that aspect of the character come about i can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in daredevil which i have no intention of seeing br br furthermore the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an about face at random moments to suit the storyline and don't even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub plot i'm also still scratching my head over the fate of cary hiroyuki tagawa's character which seems to have gone by unexplained br br if i can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot but otherwise i gained little enjoyment from elektra i know we're supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy action films but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing even by action film standards that it simply frustrated me br br well hell at least jennifer garner looks damn good
<START> contains some spoilers this movie is cheesy 80s horror in all its awfulness the plot takes way too long to get off the ground never steadies itself and then just plain crashes about 40 minutes into the film there are a few gem moments for zombie fans but not nearly enough zombies to create a real sense of terror br br the zombies also take a long time to make their appearance first there's a whole half of a movie about mobs and prison gangs the hero of the movie is an ex vietnam vet who gets caught up in the mob the main mob boss sets him up and he goes to jail in this jail they are experimenting on the prisoners to find a way to cure them of homicidal tendencies and criminal behavior but the badie psychotic head scientist military guy has other plans in mind he wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make da da da super soldiers after some infected prisoners kill a few guards and most of the prison has a round of infected communion wine the military crazy scientist guy goes hey this might be a problem and gives a call to the genius scientist turned investigative journalist hot babe ultra empowered independent woman character who of course invented the original serum she goes to the prison to see what's going down the military guy calls in a few swat teams from his secure position outside the prison and the hero guy takes charge of the few prisoners with a heart of gold when a riot breaks out the hero guy and the scientist journalist lady team up to find a cure save the warden's kids and deal with some irate prisoners both infected and not meanwhile the mob boss guy has made a deal to get into the prison so that he can save his imprisoned brother the military gets ready to blow the place up and everyone inside scrambles to find a way out br br there are a lot of gory scenes where people are killed by being pressed or pulled through prison bars there's also a creepy decapitation scene and electrocution scene involving the same infected rasta prisoner still the most disturbing scene is in the early part of the film when a gross corrupt guard rapes a prisoner br br the main highlight of this film is one scene towards the end the hero woman and kids are trying to make their way to the only escape route their path leads them to a long hallway on one side there is a wall and on the other are prison bars hundreds of bloody zombie hands reach through gracing their hair and faces as they pass by there's also a few good scenes of the classic couple of zombies munching on freshly dead bodies and many zombies ripping one guy to shreds bits br br overall worth watching if you're researching the zombie genre as it has so many zombie clichÃ©s worth noting it's practically an instruction manual on what not to do when making a zombie movie but if you're new to zombie flicks and want a real scare you should look elsewhere
<START> what this movie fails from answering is how wrong this war is and most us wars recently made only to get some oil br br how many innocent civilian casualties there has been how many lives perished and how blatantly stupid the perpetrators are br br so let me ask you if american soldier kills women and children apart from enemy its ok but if government accidentally kills their own forces by deadly chemicals while killing many civilians as well it is not your logic fails gentleman br br i'll give it 5 for the solid performance and 1 to everything else 3 in total
<START> the master of movie spectacle cecil b de mille goes west using three legends of the old west as its protagonists they probably never met gary cooper is portraying wild bill hickock james ellison as buffalo bill and jean arthur does make a nice calamity jane the story serves only for de mille to hang some marvelous action sequences on like the big indian attack scenes like that are extremely well done if you don't mind the somewhat over the top performances of the cast this is an very entertaining western look out for a very young anthony quinn essaying the role of an indian brave who participated at the battle of little big horn this part got him at least noticed in hollywood
<START> it may be the remake of 1987 autumn's tale after eleven years as the director mabel cheung claimed mabel employs rock music as the medium in this movie to express her personal attitude to life in which love desire and the consequential frustration play significantly crucial roles rock music may not be the best vehicle to convey the profound sentiment and yet it is not too inappropriate to utilize it as the life of underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than an ordinary one the director focuses on the depiction of subtle affection and ultimate vanity of life rather than mere rock music the love between father and son lovers and friends is delicately and touchingly delivered through the fine performance mabel does not attempt to beautify rock musicians as artists at all instead she tries to reproduce a true life on screen making huge efforts of years' working on this project and gathering information in beijing underground pubs br br daniel has given probably the best performance in all his movies made so far his innate dispiritedness and reticence fit the blue mood of the film perfectly
<START> although not one of vonnegut's better known works it is a definite must see interestingly thought out i especially like how the director filmed the couple in love
<START> saw a screener of this before last year's award season didn't really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended but whatever maybe for exposure at the least but the movie was a convoluted mess sure some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way but none of the characters felt very real to me at all there was not one person that i could connect with and i think that is where it failed for me sure the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards scientology wow what a grand idea let's see if that already hasn't been mined to the point of futility the whole ordeal feels fake from the lighting the casting the screenplay to the horrible visual effects which is supposed to be intentional i can tell and so can everyone else no one is laughing with you though anyways i hope it makes it out for sale on dvd at least i wouldn't want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed but it's tripe either way boring tripe at that
<START> i wished i'd taped men in white so i could watch it again br br what you mean you really enjoyed it theo br br no i mean i could watch it again to see if it was as retarded stupid and as embarrassingly unfunny as i can remember it br br a lot of people have claimed it was made for children may i suggest it was also made by children because the whole structure of the script lacks any type of discipline on the part of the producers and writers and much of set pieces seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time br br the cast don't help but i genuinely started to feel sorry for them honestly you can believe that during filming the cast had to lie to their families that they were filming a hard core porn film such was their embarrassment at having to appear in something as dismal as this to give you an idea of how bad the acting is every time baywatch babe donna d'ericco disappeared from the narrative i waited patiently for her to reappear then seconds later i forgot she was in the movie got that a star from baywatch appears and seconds later you forget they're in the movie this tells you all you need to know about the standard of men in white br br fair enough it's trying to be a live action cartoon similar to the goodies although the dismals would be a better adjective for this movie though perhaps the movie deserves some credit for never descending to toilet humour but considering this is a kids movie this didn't stop itv broadcasting it at 11 pm then there should be no near the knuckle humour in it anyway
<START> first of all let me say that i had to think a lot about writing a comment for this movie the best review for this kind of cinema can be just the silence movie addressed to housewives and to grandmothers this movie tries to look genuine and the characters should be supposed real people an italian could never think that the characters might be real they are just low profile stereotypes it gives a very misguised vision of what life is in the italian countryside the plot is weak plot which plot and the humour does not make laugh anyone older than 12
