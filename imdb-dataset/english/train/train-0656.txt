<START> i was surprised at how fascinating this movie was the performances were extremely good especially by rea as the compassionate no nonsense detective br br despite a low budget no big fx or flashy camerawork citizen x somehow manages to surpass the majority of similar big hollywood films by just telling the story br br true stories tend to end with a whimper rather than a bang and that's the case here but apart from that this is a highly recommended detective yarn
<START> just read the original story which is written by pu in 18th century strikingly the movie despict the original spirit very well though the plot was modified tremendously the film language the rhythm the special effect are all from hollywood but still there is a chinese core it is amazing how hark tsui managed to combine them together the result is pure beauty
<START> all the elements for a bad night at the movies are in place dialog riddled with biological techno babble chintzy sets balsa wood acting a horrific late '80s casio score and an overall look that suggests anything on the sci fi channel's programming schedule circa 1993 though metamorphosis starts off with a lot of promise the film unravels into bland idiocy and mst3k style cheese as clark kent wannabe 'doctor' peter houseman gene lebrock is pressured into releasing information on his secretive projects but when he tests his vague experiment on himself he transforms into a vaguely defined creature that bears more than a passing resemblance to 'dr freudstein' from house by the cemetery the fx work is fairly good for such an obviously low budget production though i suspect most of it is kept in shadow for a reason but overall metamorphosis leaves a bad retro aftertaste in your guts in spite of its hopes to sway us otherwise i can't help but agree with one character's closing remark it was a nightmare from the past
<START> i don't have much to add to what has been said before but it's very much a film of it's time and the first and likely only time that the studio hung the film totally on the dead end kids br br the warner's gave the boys plenty of help from director ray enright and an 'a' budget to an almost magical cast of supporting actors at every turn we get one of those gem performances from real pros they are too many to list but it seems like just about everybody on the warner's lot sans the very biggest stars walk through this picture see if you can spot john ridgely br br the only over the top performance is from the always reliable eduardo cianelli as a mob boss with a messianistic complex he plays this character almost exactly like that of the thuggie leader in gunga din he's something to watch and marjorie main is excellent and gets her best role since dead end br br my bid for this one is a second feature on a double bill with something like city for conquest br br hooray for warners
<START> john waters most accessible film to date is one of his better ones considering it cut down on all of the campiness and outright vulgarity which seem to litter most of his previous work sure the nudity and the sexual references are still there at least it is presented in a fashion br br that cannot be deemed too foul or disgusting due to some great casting choices this film really brought out the silliness associated with modern art and the subjective nature of your modern artist funny and somewhat lighthearted if that is possible for waters this is one of those films i would watch on a rainy day
<START> just what we need another remake of vintage hollywood cinema with eddie murphy miscast again in his second time around after the nutty professor 1996 this shows why we're running out of special ideas in making a quality movie ladies and gentlemen it has some signs of hope for its likeable and delightful imagery of animals who can act and speak with humans things can only get more worse unfortunately bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this piece of family funfare instantly even parents and children saw the trailer ad on the family channel which was followed by utter angst and disgust in the movie theater sad to say this is the more progressive pre millennium era but enjoy it while it lasts 'cause things can only get worse with time more went wrong with the all new dr dolittle it is absolutely plotless feeling too flat i also hate that irritating voice of chris rock we need more talented voice overs than a bunch of overpaid celebs who don't want to declare bankruptcy i'll have to agree on my local newspaper giving this among the top five worst movies of 1998 then again the original version wasn't any good either murphy's next project could be patton if he's not careful
<START> when the grinch came out i was excited though i thought it was going to be a happy go lucky film and it was though it did have a little nightmare before christmas touch to it you know kind of dark and spooky i loved this film because it helped fill people with the christmas spirit so mostly the grinch saved christmas and what happened then well in whoville they say that the grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day merry grinchmas
<START> sensual and tough maria braun hanna schygula marries a soldier in the middle of world war ii and spends a half of day and the whole night with him that's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison she carries on with her life becomes a successful businesswoman being not only sensual but intelligent ambitious and willing to use sex whenever or wherever necessary i don't know a thing about business but i do know what german women want you might even say i'm an expert on it while climbing up to the success she always remembers her husband hermann her man and convinces herself that whatever she does Â is for him for their future happy life together maria braun 's style reminds much of melodramas by fassbinder's favorite hollywood director douglas sirk and offers a glimpse of the loss and survival in postwar germany hanna schygula literally shines in every scene of the movie and she is fantastic br br 8 5 10
<START> i went to see this movie with the most positive expectations i had seen jacquet's previous movie march of the penguins and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio however i was severely disappointed most of all this movie is terribly boring literally nothing happens i tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend and we both ended up laughing because i could only stammer things like well then the winter comes and then spring and then there's an eagle and a river and one time it is dark and the girl goes into a cave and another time the fox has babies and so on after about half an hour i began sighing yawning rolling my eyes cursing the reviewer at the radio station and hoping that it would be over soon but the movie went on and on when it finally ended i had sunken so deep into my chair that i must have looked somewhat similar to stephen hawking the most annoying parts of the movie are a the girl who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with she wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie one year and shows exactly two facial expressions joy and seriousness she is cute no question about that however a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all too human presence i found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear drown in the river or something similarly terrible b the commentary by the girl's adult voice which tells us nothing but negligible obvious boring redundant things c the music which is desperately lacking subtlety when the girl is happily jumping around the music jumps around too when the fox is threatened by an eagle the music becomes threatening too it reminded me of the very early days of film making and was just too predictable to enjoy admittedly many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it at least they got somehow involved thus my warning concerns adults only if you are over ten years old avoid this movie you can get a better and cheaper sleep in most other places
<START> watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue it initially looks great but ultimately provides no satisfaction none br br the plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil so how is it possible that with this basic plot and robin williams that the movie still turns out so badly it's because the picture is all appearance with no substance whatsoever much like the terrible popeye picture williams did at the beginning of his film career the film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there wasn't enough money left over to hire writers who had graduated grade school br br the film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on i really am unsure why it was made in the first place it certainly wasn't made to provide any sort of entertainment
<START> the basic plot in this movie isn't bad a lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored but despite good acting by robert young and eve arden the movie is a mess the blame for this i place on either joan crawford or the director or both as her performance is just awful instead of being a real person she does a wonderful impersonation of a deer caught in the headlights in other words she stares off into space and has a golly i am soooo stunned expression after just a few minutes it really became annoying for me now this is certainly not the only crawford film i dislike for her performance as she had done more than her share of overacting in films such as johnny guitar or many of her later films such as berserk my advice is to try a different crawford film there certainly were better
<START> i was skimming over the list of films of richard burton when i came to this title that i recall vividly from when i first saw it on cable in 1982 i remember dialogue from tatum o'neal that was just amazingly bad i remember richard burton's character looking so hopelessly lost and then remembering how his motivations didn't translate to me in short i remember circle of two because it was so phenomenally awful br br this movie came out at a time when america was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality recall the blue lagoon and other brooke shields annoyances lipstick little darlings beau pere and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex particularly with adults as a teenager during this time i found the obsession combined with the sexual excesses of the 70's and 80's made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out so to speak br br circle of two is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient like blue lagoon in fact it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave if totally failed way but honestly it is one of those films you will never see if you didn't see it on its first run because it was so truly awful no one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again
<START> first off i want to say thanks disney for finally releasing the cinderella movie on dvd now you have all the disney animated films on dvd including the 1999 limited editions what are you going to do next you're going to disney world well technically i mean look at the castle br br anyways disney remains magical in his 1950 animated classic film cinderella the movie that put fairy tale movies on the map we are all familiar with the story of cinderella her stepsisters her date the glass slipper the pumpkin that turns into a carriage just for saying bippity boppity boo and of course trying to head home by midnight br br what i like about this film it's a grand old fairy tale that children like now in a movie form as well as on dvd as well br br cinderella thank you disney 10 stars
<START> this had to be one of the worst films ever when kate shows up and jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start clapping so hollywood another bad scene was when kate was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement andie's acting is so bad in this film i could not connect with them or feel there love for each other the other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed andie anyway this was such a campy movie i usually like these type of films but i just couldn't get into this film too many unlikely situations and again andie's acting didn't help the film also she is all gums lancome must put her makeup on with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in the commericals
<START> i love korean films because they have the ability to really quiet eerily really capture real life i tend to watch korean movies just for that reason alone i've seen this directors other movies before the one that comes closest to the feelings i got from this is oasis and another awesome film called this charming girl br br however my title summary is supposed to be from a chrstian perspective so i'll just start doing that instead of just showering it with praise br br for a non christian perspective director chang dong lee has captured an unbiased and almost eerily real portrayal of a modern protestant church regardless of denomination warts and all i've always been waiting for a christian film that truly portrays the darker recesses of church life because christian films tend to speak in a language that is different to those they want to share their faith to many films with religious undertones though having good motives tend to just have the resonance of a disney film or after school special they need to show life as it is real people curse real people lust real people fall and though christians believe that salvation is available to those that seek it we are still challenged by the everyday horrors of this life and do yeon jeon's character is a totally honest and almost brutal portrayal of a woman that found god but because of life's bitter realities loses that love for him she once had she doesn't deny god exists it is just that she refuses to accept to live with the idea that he is an all loving and forgiving god br br in her decent to the edges of morality and madness her character asks questions that are in the mind of every one religious or not br br if god is love why does he allow such terrible things to happen this film doesn't answer that rightly so and i believe the last 10 minutes of the film though open to interpretation leaves us with a hopeful future for our main character and brings the idea of secret sunshine full circle br br i don't believe for a second that this film tried to be religious or had in any way tried and set out to be that there in lies the reason why it worked even more it's real it's honest and because of that it is by far the best summation of a real christian life i have seen on film
<START> i grew up on scooby doo where are you and i still love it it is one of my favourite cartoons along with darkwing duck talespin peter pan and the pirates and tom and jerry this show though is good for kids the voices are good don messick and casey kasem are perfect as scooby and shaggy the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation however it is rather disappointing i normally don't mind scrappy but when he appears to be like the main character it gets annoying fast complete with the catchphrase puppy power scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual also half the gang are missing after the first year somehow it didn't feel like scooby doo and the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies all in all not as bad as shaggy and scooby doo get a clue but this show is disappointing 4 10 for the animation voices theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids bethany cox
<START> edwin porter's 1903 short film entitled the great train robbery bursts onto the screen with so much excitement and ingenuity that one prepares to be blown away by another pioneering early film just like melies' a trip to the moon critics have hailed this as being the film that introduced the western genre into modern cinema in my eyes they were right it had everything from the planning the actual heist of the train the murder of an unwanted civilian and that looming final scene that makes you realize that these villains mean business Â it was all monumental for its time from here to eastwood every western filmmaker has used porter's image in some form or another to create their own story one cannot say that this film didn't open the door but the struggle comes from the story itself the genre was defined by porter but outside of its initial excitement Â there really isn't anything to grapple onto perhaps i am jaded by the clichÃ© modern westerns and their haphazard messages but how can something be clichÃ© before being clichÃ© to me the great train robbery seemed forced untraceable and unsurprising br br unlike melies porter tells a very linear story robbers change the course of a train rob it then shoot at random people just to prove they are the true villains and the final scene ends like any predestined film without any surprises or glitches and that looming man with a gun to your proverbial face it is bland porter's film is boring in the edition i watched there was an addition of color near to the end to emphasize emotion which felt cheap and was not encouraging to the filmmaker or to the viewer the issue remains that while it is important porter's film has been borrowed time and time again it has in effect become diluted the story itself does not carry the emotional powerhouse it once has unlike melies early film i cannot watch this again i know what has happened i know there is very little missing from behind the scenes and that finally it is just what it has set out to be Â a simple story leading from point a to point b to point c this issue is not only my gripe with this film but also the strongest element to see in such an early film while it was dull the fact that it told such a strong narrative Â that our characters were characters with motives and drives was outstanding to see in an era where nonfiction films seemed mainstream this broke the mold again not that i am jumping on the prophetic bandwagon about this film Â it is an important film Â it just isn't a great film br br overall i was eager to jump into this film to see where the roots of the western genre were planted but i was equally as happy to leave this film behind porter is a talented director and g m anderson obviously went on to be very successful in the created field but i just wasn't in awe of the film i wasn't expecting big budget effects like melies work nor was i expecting a duplicate of a trip to the moon but i did want to see the same creativity exploration and originality i felt porter played it safe if that can be said with such an early film but i couldn't feel the excitement as our villains did their evil deeds i wasn't rooting for anyone and the final conclusion proved that the kitschy ness of it had worn off minutes after the film started it was pioneering but not monumental the great train robbery has lost its space in the time capsule of cinema br br grade out of
<START> this is one of my all time favorite films and while it may move too slowly for some it's well worth seeing a corporate lawyer richard chamberlain is dragged into a case involving city aborigines and this is no ordinary case ok a man has died but it wasn't exactly a normal killing there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic oppressive the aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans this has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about city vs tribal aborigines and of course no abo in the big city would practice tribal ways uh huh chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what's happening although no matter how many times i've seen this i can't quite grasp the exact connection this is a very eerie and creepy film and is a fine example of peter weir's ability to create tension out of nothing the ending is a little ambiguous but i take it literally it's the easiest way out and the scariest 10 out of 10 and highly recommended
<START> bruce almighty is the best jim carrey work since the truman show and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent hey hollywood look how good i can act box office disappointments it's great to see jim recognizing and embracing his strengths he won't get an academy award but the film itself will last longer than many of the awarded films of the academy he is at the top of his form in this most recent film it's like the return of an old friend br br carrey freeman and aniston all do a great job together comfortable in their comedy roles superb comic timing and obviously having fun together but without the hey mom look how funny i am type of comedy a real surprise was steven carrell as carrey's nemesis carrell of the daily show fame who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three years br br i can foresee the religious nuts in the us will be up in arms over the treatment of god but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will without married with children t o complain about this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities who know the types men adorned in gold watches on sunday morning and late nigh television selling prayers to god and again about 0 5 of the country will care and 80 of the media will report it br br the bottom line this a purely entertaining film each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do and a feel good feeling at the movie conclusion a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carry br br thanks again jim it's great to have you back
<START> i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst the gorilla looks just terrific and the eyes were especially lifelike it's even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla it's an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans how they feel the same emotions we do and yet how we really can't treat them just like people because they aren't not many films venture into this territory and it's worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human animal similarity
