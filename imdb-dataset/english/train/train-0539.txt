<START> i have begun to melt so i will make this review as short and sweet as possible br br there's this astronaut and he goes up in a spacecraft with two other guys ya know except something happens that exposes him to radiation and then when they come back well never mind what happened to the other guys but our astronaut has begun to melt no not just burn up but melt like an ice cream cone in july well ok maybe not that fast but ya know what i mean br br anyway he gets all red gooey and the fact that he's melting makes him really mad i guess he also checked out the melting man handbook because suddenly he knows that in order to keep from totally melting away he has to eat human flesh so he starts ripping people apart br br there are other characters but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts and melts do you really need any others what's important is who will he munch next and what will be left of them how long will it take for him to just melt away to nothing why was this movie made in the first place where did they get the money when will you fall asleep while watching it br br i've very nearly melted but i still have enough time left to tell you that this movie is dreadfully boring even though the idea is really cool and kind of gross the makeup is neat but everything else is splat
<START> first i liked that movie it seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments the costume designer albert wolsky did his best the same as wonderful set decorator robert r benton this man really had a very good taste but the script writers disappointed me extremely the best ending would be the scene on the ladder but instead of it they decided that the father and his daughter should be together don't like the ending the father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex wife knows about it and finds it alright it would be ok if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body but they did not they only deprived him of memories the actors were good they were really funny cybill shepherd was charming robert downey jr was very funny in the dancing scene but some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting for example corinne jeffries played by cybill shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years it's a long time she was true to him she loved nobody but him and when she met him and was just about making love to him after a scene with her friend philip train ryan o'neal she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years it would be a good movie if not the ending and some missed human psychology
<START> dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial brain dead and pointless the film is excellent the acting by both denzel and dakota she will go sky high trust me on that are just fabulous and the plot is mind blowing actually fabulous is a small word to use for such talented actors the film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film if you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films you still haven't watched your favorite one yet trust me in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling the film is awesome see it rent it buy it or whatever just don't miss it
<START> still the definitive program about the second world war the world at war isn't just long but also very informative the series contains 26 episodes each episode lasts for about 45 min and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war most episodes are about the war in europe and there are several episodes about the war in the pacific other episodes include information about the wars in africa burma the atlantic and the home fronts of germany great britain united states and soviet union there is one episode that's dedicated to the holocaust the series starts off with the episode a new germany 1933 1939 and tells about the rise of the nazis in germany and german territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war the series ends with the episode remember the war's influence in a post war world remember is a fitting episode to end this great program every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits the credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme there are many fitting music pieces throughout the series each episode is like a mini film the footage is fantastic and so is the way it was put together in addition some of the footage is in color the information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining br br the series was produced by jeremy isaacs for thames television uk commissioned in 1969 it took four years to produce such was the depth of its research the series was narrated by laurence olivier one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century the series interviewed leading members of the allied and axis campaigns including eyewitness accounts by civilians enlisted men officers and politicians amongst them albert speer karl donitz jimmy stewart bill mauldin curtis lemay lord mountbatten alger hiss toshikazu kase arthur harris charles sweeney paul tibbets traudl junge and historian stephen ambrose jeremy isaacs says in the making of the world at war that he sought to interview not necessarily the surviving big names but their aides and assistants the most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed according to isaacs was heinrich himmler's adjutant karl wolff the latter admitted to witnessing a large scale execution in himmler's presence br br the world at war is often considered to be the definitive television history of the second world war some consider it the finest example of the documentary form in a list of the 100 greatest british television programmes drawn up by the british film institute in 2000 voted for by industry professionals the world at war ranked 19th the program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war after watching a few episodes i liked the series so much that i tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other i've seen some of them several times there are two other great documentary series that i know of that may be of interest to the viewer one is called the great war 1964 that's about world war i the other is called cold war 1998 that's about the cold war obviously
<START> elvira mistress of the dark 1988 br br directed by james signorelli br br starring cassandra peterson w morgan sheppard daniel greene and edie mcclurg br br plot elvira cassandra peterson quits her tv show and heads to the small christian town fallwell massachusettes to collect on her dead aunt's inheritance hoping to make big bucks to open up a show in vegas unfortunately for her all she gets is a creepy old house a poodle and a magic cookbook while in fallwell elvira tries to make money breathe some life into the teenagers win the heart of a stud daniel greene avoid being burned at the stake and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle w morgan sheppard who is planning to use the book to end the world br br my thoughts i love both cassandra peterson and her alter ego elvira she is a very successful beautiful and funny woman and as elvira she's all that plus morbid and hilariously naive not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers in this movie her charms are put to good use br br i loved the whole 'fish out of water' feel to the film you got elvira with her low cut black dress her big black hair and her enormous 'twins' and she's in a christian town where most of the girls aren't even allowed to wear makeup this also makes her love story with bob daniel greene a lot more entertaining br br w morgan sheppard is equally great as elvira's uncle nemesis vincent out to steal the book to use it for evil he has a lot of presence but still doesn't get in the way and steal scenes from elvira br br what really makes the film is not the plot but the many jokes everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a scary movie sequel i hear there are about 56 boob jokes in this film and any fan of roger corman b horror flicks will love the spoofing in this film br br if you love elvira you will love this flick also check out elvira's haunted hills
<START> in an apparent attempt to avoid remaking the original movie an excellent cast that should have made this inherently funny classic neil simon material better than the original failed on every level br br the chemistry between goldie hawn and steve martin that was magic in housesitter' was nonexistent in this effort
<START> no one better spoil this piece of work awesome movie written expertly by the likes of ira levin and depicted with the best performance of christopher reeve's career and one of caine's very best this is simply excellent i wish i could catch a staged version somewhere maybe someday i will i hope this grossly underrated overlooked film has not become too difficult to locate because it a 'must' for any hitchcockian agatha phile or lover of great film one of very few movies i couldn't instantly solve or predict and worth a second or even third viewing deathtrap gets a 9 10 and earns every iota of it we need and deserve more movies like this
<START> i did not set very high expectations for this movie which left me pleasantly surprised the story is a little strange sometimes but overall i think it has an acceptable credibility the action scenes are rather nice and the accompanying music is used to induce a a bit of patriotic feelings common to us movies this may not be the best movie ever but it's uncommon for sweden and i hope to see more similar ones in the future
<START> i think this is probably one of the worst movies i've watched in a long time br br trying to get the 'same characters' with different people is such a bad idea if they couldn't get sara michelle g and ryan p in this one they should have just cut their losses and said to heck with it instead they get new actors that are horrible at what they did i seriously felt like i was at a high school or bad college play with the lever of acting these people put forth br br where do they get some of these people was this their first movie it sure seemed like it br br this movie also parallels the original in a few lines of speech i had just got done watching the first one and popped 2 in i was all excited to get to watch the second one and it ended up being the worst show i've seen in a while i don't hardly ever ever turn off a movie but this one definitely went off after about 30 40 min
<START> really bad why anyone thinks this is a good film let alone funny is a true mystery i like comedies as much as the next man and i loved a christmas story the fact that it has the same director and was based on the same writer's memoirs has me completely puzzled as to why this film is such a complete failure on every level charles grodin is woefully miscast as the father for starters for another it does not seem to have the same pacing it just doesn't flow well everything seems tired and forced the joy of life that permeated the first film is completely absent here you just want the movie to end i wouldn't even recommend this movie for curiosity seekers who enjoyed a christmas story it's that bad 1 10
<START> when i first watched robotboy i found it fresh and interesting but then i noticed that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself what is good bad episodes became predictable and main characters are not interesting again we see a hyper smart boy beaten by his older brother parents who don't understand their kid and his friends girl and fat boy also this show has no logic a super modern robot who works on two aa size batteries and can use a lot of weapons but the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super activated modes we see two different robots and it declines main idea of the show robot must learn how to behave himself in human society
<START> i'm 60 years old a guitarist lead rhythm and over the last forty years i've been in four bands it's all there the fights the foul ups the rotten food the worse accommodation always travelling little or no money and every one was drunk or high but the clubs the fans and the music made it all worth it just like strange fruit i'm too damn old for it now and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking but for the length of that video it all came back and it was all there the birds the brawls and the booze and i was young again it's just like billy connolly's voice over god likes that 70's stuff rock on forever
<START> what a bad bad film i can't believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious amateurish excuse for a real movie i left the theater before the end stunned by how bad the direction and camera work of that movie were and to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and tawdry br br at least this film showed me once and for all that the sundance festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film making than anything else br br avoid at all costs you'll want your time back i know i did
<START> this is a japanese film but there is quite a bit of english also spoken in here it's a pretty film with nice visuals featuring the scenic beauty of hawaii br br however that was the only redeeming quality for me the story was generally boring who wants to watch a young woman sulk for 90 percent of the film because her picture husband is a lot older than he advertised he was granted that could be a bummer but get over it br br only in the last 10 minutes does she do an about face and become fond of him by then for most viewers it was too little too late we'd fallen asleep by then
<START> a shift in outlook is neccesary to enjoy modern british films one that somehow allows them to be seen in their own right and for their own qualities rather than by the criteria that american films are judged britfilm has to try hard to be gritty and finds it hard to make it but at warmth british films can lord it over their otherwise overwhelming competitor br br this film fails not in its content but only in attaching itself to the predeccesor so allowing it to be all to easily seen as the work of star and director somewhere near the end of their tethers it's a couple of decades later gregory teaching and this time with two girls on his mind he teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses when students he's fired up find abuses in their midst he must face whether he's just all talk br br this is a subversive film in that there's not the usual worldly character of any american movie that you expect to do whatever he does but a naive man boy who may still put everything on the line for principles maybe it's certainly no protest by numbers though being too warm where u s film may seem realistic because they're urban and gritty this and other british films of recent years those that don't try to match america for visceral thrills are real because british humour reveals truths
<START> adrianne should really get a life without mr brady she nauseates me and has been one of the main reasons why i know longer tune in to the show it's pretty brainless show and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analyzed to death this makes them look sound they are anything but ready for marriage and yet i know these disagreements are all part of life i guess to some people this is entertainment if this happens to fall into next season i will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash though i would not be terribly surprised can't even stand the commercials for this show anymore i hope they're getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week however the a girl has one heck of great butt
<START> after having seen the canadian icelandic british 2004 production of beowulf grendel which i thought brilliant and stunning i approached this the first of 3 newer beowulf movies due out this year with trepidation as soon as i heard viking and saw the horned helmets i groaned these were migration era swedes and danes not vikings they came later and even the vikings never wore horns on their helmets horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you then there's hrolfgar's palace which looks like a set for a movie about greece or rome not 6th century denmark the swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods i spotted weapons that might have been used by crusaders in kingdom of heaven and one character was even wielding a windlass steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from beowulf grendel beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing the biggest yuk was a secret weapon crossbow complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles that looked like something bought from iraqi insurgents the special effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that beowulf could never have torn off an arm as he did in the poem thank the gods for bazooka crossbows i could go on but i won't
<START> caught this by accident on a t v showing and could hardly believe how utterly awful the whole experience was by comparison the original a man called horse was spell binding because it held one's interest throughout but this piece of nonsense words fail me it was bad enough to have some kind of a story presented with all the impact of a wet loaf of bread but that error was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles throughout whenever the so called sioux spoke for goodness sake couldn't the film makers have found enough north american indians who were also actors and near actors to perform as indians in this farrago instead of the imposters they actually used i also found it quite embarrassing watching richard harris cavorting all around the countryside at the obvious behest of the director standing just behind camera telling him to run and jump from pointless point a to pointless point b just to make up film footage and minutes absolutely terrible in all respects
<START> to make a good movie you either need excellent actors or an excellent director you need at least one of the two in this eye of the needle we have none br br i don't even remember the name of the director he mustn't have done much in his career i like very much donald sutherland but he absolutely cannot be the main actor in a movie he falls short sutherland is excellent in a movie when he appears for not more than 15 minutes i would say for instance that sutherland was excellent in jfk of oliver stone when he talked to kevin costner on the bench of a park for 10 minutes non stop without even taking a breath wonderful but sutherland being the principal actor in a movie is no good br br kate nelligan she is probably good for tv series the dvd is awful terrible colors terrible light i couldn't even appreciate the scenery of storm island for how lousy the photography was br br this ken follett story was good but it's a pity they turned it into an uninteresting movie
<START> the only redeeming quality of this overlong miscast melodrama is the scenery of southern france and the voice of nana mascouri singing the theme song stephanie powers is miscast and betrayed by a phony accent as has been pointed out she is too old to play an 18 year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age granddaughter lee remick is good although she also is ageless in her later years the talented joanna lumley is under utilized and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son robert urich finally marries grandma stephanie powers stacey keach's ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him don't know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal the most credible performance is given by ian richardson who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs it strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them can anybody believe that handsome robert urich would remain single for decades waiting for stephanie powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals the ww2 engagement between the wehrmacht and the marquis is laughable to begin with the germans did not occupy the provence section of france until late in the war it was controlled by the vichy french puppet government we see the french resistance staging a daylight raid on mistral's villa to steal sheets after which they all lounge under a bridge waiting for a lumbering truckload of nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them if you want to see a well acted mini series set in a foreign country don't watch mistral's daughter a far better alternative would be the thorn birds
