<START> i had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in vietnam because of mental problems he experienced after coming back so when i saw part of this movie one night on a pay for view channel i was intrigued i wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt as he got ready for vietnam i went out and rented this movie and i have to say it is the most heart wrenching film i have ever seen i bought the dvd immediately after renting it the way it pulls you in so many different directions emotionally is something i've never experienced with any other film as far as vietnam subject films go i think it is the best one although platoon runs a close second besides all of that i think it is also colin farrell's best performance as an actor i like him in most of his movies but in this one he was incredible i gave this a 10 rating because it is one of my top five favorite movies
<START> even this early in his career capra was quite accomplished with his camera work and his timing this is a thin story and quite predictable at times but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately the first part looks like a cinderella story though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that the rich 'prince' will lose his fortune br br nonetheless because of his good cast and fast pace it's easy to get caught up in the clichÃ©s then the movie does become more original as the married couple have to find a way to make a living the ending is very predictable but satisfying i also want to compliment the title writing very witty and fun
<START> the word 1st in the title has more ominous meaning for the viewers of this film than for its crime victims at least they don't have to stick around and watch this interminable film reach its own demise br br 1st should refer to 1st draft of a script 1st takes used in each performance in the final film 1st edit in post production etcetera etcetera br br the movie is not cast too badly it's just that everything about the film come off as worse than third rate from the goofy script to the wooden performances and while suffering through this cobbled together film by the 2 hour mark you want to be put out of your misery at 160 minutes long it is readily apparent that it should have been edited to under 2 hours br br going into details concerning the lame script and acting serves little purposes even in the equally awful lake placid at least the performances bill pullman and bridget fonda constructed out of an extremely weak script were nuanced enough to make you laugh at the movie in 1st to die one ends up grieving only for the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the opening scene of the preparation of the female lead's suicide br br the editing is so bad one is never introduced to one of the main characters who i think were never quite told is a d a she just appears in one scene in the middle of a conversation obviously the scene where she is introduced to the viewer was dropped on the editor's floor and no one realized that a character appearing out of nowhere was an unusual film ploy br br in a word don't waste your time with this one my wife and i wish we didn't but at least we created our own diversions by commenting in various places in the film like it was mystery science theater meanwhile in cleveland
<START> this movie is a waste of film stock do you believe that the map of a plan of a military mission would be placed on an easel on a patio in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see it happened in this film do you believe that a deaf person would actually be enlisted in the active duty army in europe during wwii to serve in a negro unit cooking supply services burial detail etc it happened in this film do you believe that a black and supposedly intelligent officer would select this same deaf k p to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the germans before the allies arrived it happened in this film would you be surprised that the deaf soldier didn't realize that a german plane was approaching from behind and would strafe and kill him it happened in this film would you be surprised that a group of american soldiers hold up in a barn at a farmhouse that the germans happened upon would shout out their emotions at the sight of the german soldiers who were just 50' away they did it in this film and left any possible entrances to the barn the germans might check totally unprotected would you believe that over the airwaves and in clear english the captain mentioned the general's rank if not his name as the person he was speaking with and that the general in plain english over open airwaves said that the dam had to be protected the next day maybe they should have just sent in an emissary to tell which direction the american attack would be coming from just to make it a little easier on the germans this so called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 worst films if it were i'm sure it would do well watch it at your own risk
<START> despite its interesting premise 'sniper' is quite tedious with a tighter script and sharper directing it could have been electrifying instead it plods along with little tension
<START> what would you expect from a film titled 'surviving christmas'and presented as 'festive fun' something like ghandi or english patient there are lots of things i love about this film it's funny it is very well cast and it is superbly written i came to the film as a kaplan elfort fan but was dubious when i read the plot it sounded ridiculous but the film doesn't come across like that because affleck as drew latham plays his part perfectly one minute a child like adult the next a mature man who realises he has gained everything in life apart from what he really wants in fact we see latham grow up in this film when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realises that their lives are not so good he sees that his own lot is not so bad br br this film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies i have seen comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama it either works or it doesn't and very few comedy writers get it correct every time i particularly loved the drama scene where the family take to reading parts written by latham the pleasure is in the reaction of tom valco james gandolfini and the comments of brian valco josh zuckerman it is the dilemma of the greedy tom valco who has to bite his tongue wear silly hats or sing to the christmas tree in order to earn the prize money that keeps the film moving along well br br the addition of daughter alicia christina applegate into the story brings a delightful romantic angle and why not in a christmas film of course its corny and contrived he's rich and handsome she's beautiful and single and so inevitably her and afflect end up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face great one thing i would have liked was more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but i can't really complain i got what i wanted
<START> i am not going to lie this is a great movie i saw it about 4 months ago at my local theatre i saw it a second time and i was somewhat bored in the slow scenes sid the sloth is not all that flattering but diego a mountain lion i think is really good in the movie the animation is outstanding and the story has a touching ending it is worth taking kids 10 and under to but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring also the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting like i said it is a pretty good movie but i would rate toy story 2 or shrek higher 8 10
<START> why did i waste 1 5 hours of my life watching this why was this film even made why am i even commenting on this film br br one reviewer said this film took patience to watch and it was n't for everybody i cannot figure out who this movie is for maybe after dropping a hit of acid somebody somewhere could watch this and make some sense out of it it is incoherent it isn't experimental it's plain and simple garbage the film follows no plot line whatsoever just when you think you have something well you don't br br i think the ending brought some finality to the film no pun intended the viewer gets a glimpse of what might have been going on i don't think i put a spoiler in here not that it would matter this film is another must miss in the world of filmdom
<START> the worst kind of film basically the us declaration of independence was replaced with a plasma screen and this fooled the museum's security for several days eh br br the plasma screen that would theoretically run for less than 2 seconds off that watch battery assuming it had a low enough internal resistance to deliver the required current which it wouldn't br br it would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter but that system wouldn't fit into the case sorry to be anal but this isn't even close to being plausible the rest of the film wasn't a great deal better and i'm left wondering why the budget couldn't have been donated to charity or me
<START> five across the eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew they stop off at a store accidentally hit another car decide to just drive off leave it soon after the other car forces them to stop a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out shouts at them makes them take their clothes off makes them pee on them then randomly drives off shaken shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost are low on gas br br produced directed by greg swinson ryan theissen with swinson writing the thing theissen responsible for the cinematography editing i have to say that five across the eyes is easily one of the worst films i have ever seen if not the worst i mean i'm struggling to think of a film i have seen that's worse now let me start off by saying that i am sure a lot of the film making decision taken here were deliberate to try provoke atmosphere tension realism suspense but there is not one aspect of five across the eyes that i didn't hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on youtube even then it's still slightly embarrassing a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that i could have been doing something more entertaining fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers the reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the imdb the amount of 1 star comments is revealing they can't all be wrong right it's message board which i think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks it's absolutely trashed by just about everyone the phrase 'the worst film i have ever seen' is used a few times to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things i have to agree with them the story is terrible alright i suspect it's meant to be minimalistic but this minimal there's never any reason or explanation for the events that happen it just feels totally random it goes on for ages the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature the dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who don't seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff screaming a lot oh god the screaming there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates annoys prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly then there's the real killer the entire film is set shot within the confines of a mini van seriously the camera never leaves this car as you can imagine it gets really boring add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen five across the eyes is a film that i hated with a passion br br on a technical level again i can see that the film making style here was a deliberate choice but i have to be honest again say five across the eyes is the worst looking film i have ever seen as a fan of film i like my films to look like proper films as it's a visual medium i definitely don't want them to look worse than the average youtube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while i was drunk it really does look that amateurish that bad it's a complete eyesore i hated every moment of every second of it just think the blair witch project 1999 only ten times worse looking sounding you will be almost there there are times during five across the eyes when you literally can't tell what's going on or happening because of the camera work the almost pitch black grainy contrast levels the violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood a stabbing at the end br br low budget doesn't even begin to describe five across the eyes with a supposed budget of about 4 000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release the two vans in the film were owned by members of the production that's basically pretty much the entire budget right there the locations the acting is pretty bad by the main cast i just hated all the fake put on crying screaming that didn't convince at all but did irritate immensely br br five across the eyes will go down as one of the worst films i have ever seen i have seen a few films whenever anyone now ask's me what's the worst film i have ever seen five across the eyes will definitely get a mention i hated it every single aspect wretched moment of it
<START> first of all i saw this movie without knowing anything about it i just knew that joel schumacher did it and that was enough for me a friend and i went to see it at a danish film festival called the night film festival which is a lot of different movies shown after hours the festival pretty much specializes in showing movies that wouldn't otherwise be shown in danish theaters br br anyway my friend and i went to see it and we were astonished at how real it seemed and that it really struck a cord with our feelings we really got caught up in the plot without being able to figure out the ending which is a great plus in our book br br the film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the danish initiative dogma 95 which was started by 4 danish directors including lars von trier dancer in the dark br br in conclusion the movie is really worth seeing it gives a different perspective on how things were for the american g i joe coming out of school being expected to serve their country in battle a long way from home br br also colin farrell is exceptional in this movie i haven't seen him before but i can't wait to see more of him br br lars p helvard
<START> robert taylor and stewart granger switch the goodie baddie roles they held in all the brothers were valiant taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his bad guy role but granger plays his part perfectly however the real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest the film is perfectly made with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given the direction is taut and although the film is no light hearted entertainment it is to my way of thinking a major film unjustly ignored by the cognoscenti
<START> in what could have been an otherwise run of the mill mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties the subtle free love period the creators of this film pile on ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario and top it all off with a trite little cherry on top happily ever after ending at no time did i ever feel sympathy for diane lane or anna paquin in their troublesome middle class care free life nor did i feel for the emasculated liev shrieber the story line plods along slowly to its predictable pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and watchable about this film is the stunning diane lane topless here's a hint it occurs about 30 minutes into the film fast forward to that part and skip the rest
<START> would probably be the best word to describe this film in my opinion besides one great heck of a fan service for fan girls well that was redundant it was the story that blew me away hurray for takahisa zeze and gackt and i know some people will disagree with me on this one but it wasn't any of the big three actors the guys that played sho son and kei that gave the best performance for me anyway it was taro yamamoto boy 5 from battle royale br br don't get me wrong i like hyde i worship his voice but the problem was that some of his scenes came a little bit 'off' but i loved that scene where he danced with the dead guy's body killing the other guys and gackt wasn't at all that bad too i preferred how his character was kind of aloof from the start nothing much i can say about my background on lee hom wang i won't pretend to know him but he carried his own weight with the star studded cast br br this movie paved the way for one of the best collaborations i've ever heard orenji no taiyou forgive my spelling if it's wrong while the complete song lasts about nine minutes you wouldn't notice the length because you'd be enjoying hearing gackt and hyde together br br anyway this movie is a must see not only for the fans huge fan base but for those who enjoy sci fi futuristic movies asian style
<START> former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy rob lowe stars in a film set in a high security american prison i had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like tobias in the first series of oz but proximity isn t that kind of film it s more like a man on the run film like the fugitive it also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with james coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases
<START> on paper this looked like a great concept average guy on the rebound dates up tight bookish museum curator who is really a hot superhero who saves the world on a regular basis however director ivan reitman and writer don payne of the simpson's almost fatally miscalculate in having their hero g girl played by striking uma thurman come off as a total nut job as both superhero and secret identity persona jenny johnson the movie even cops to this in a conversation between jenny and matt saunders luke wilson following his rescue by g girl from the statue of liberty jenny curiously asks matt what was g girl like matt replies she's kind of nuttyÂ i think the intent was to have jenny thurman be this lonely young woman who has no one in her life isolated by her great physical powers thurman does the best she can but her jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of prozac luke wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend br br my super ex girlfriend is also a victim of bad timing coming on the tail end of superman returns which plays superhero straight up so to speak with all its quirks and inconsistent writing i still thought my super ex girlfriend was funny and enjoyed the movie given that this is an ivan reitman movie this could have been a lot better reitman starts with a great premise and really squanders it first off we all love the hero here neither jenny nor g girl is really all that likable this is surprising for uma thurman who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence in the beginning her jenny g girl is just plain weird shocking because if there is a woman who can play a superhero she is thurmanÂshe looks great only toward the end does her jenny become more sympathetic instead of caricature although my super ex is not a straight superhero story rather a romantic comedy of sorts it does not provide what every superhero mythology requiresÂa great super villain here we have professor bedlam aka barry eddie izzard who really is evil lite he is no lex luthor no plans for global domination bedlam rather barry does hold a grudge against g girl and expectedly it has to do with their shared past what is bizarre you don't know who you would rather spend time withÂbedlam or g girl luke wilson's matt is just some dude who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero one of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend vaughn rainn wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense and this dilutes his likable charm this does however work in the comic sex scene with jenny matt while dating jenny g girl realizes that he is in love with his co worker hannah perky anna faris so how does matt break up with g girl well it's not pretty and for the most part hilarious br br dramatic superhero movies work romantic comedies with chemistry work what may be inherently difficult are superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies everyone loves the hero however hero nut job maybe not with all uma thurman's talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly and she does not get sufficient support from reitman and payne thurman and wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings my super ex girlfriend is fun and funny though given all involved the movie could have been super
<START> hey babu riba is a film about a young woman mariana nicknamed esther after a famous american movie star and four young men glenn sacha kicha and pop all perhaps 15 17 years old in 1953 belgrade yugoslavia the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz blue jeans or anything american it seems br br the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties in the wake of changing communist politics they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 the year before the film was made br br i enjoyed the film with some reservations the subtitles for one thing were difficult especially in the beginning there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all perhaps the conversational pace required it but i couldn't always both read the text and absorb the scene which caused me to not always understand which character was involved i watched the movie a video from our public library with a friend and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative br br this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability idealism and strong and loyal bonds to each other there is a main flashforward and it was intriguing keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis a vis the 1953 cast and what had actually happened br br i would rate it 7 out of 10 and would like to see other films by the director jovan acin 1941 1991
<START> the first war to be 100 outsourced dan ackroyd's line says it all this is a hard to describe film comedy satire action screwball it reminded once or twice of dr strangelove especially so in the scenes featuring ben kingsley who did a remarkable job i think i had no particular expectations of this film though i am a big john cusack fan so i just let the movie wash over me and as a result i was quite entertained the political satire is painfully accurate and quite damning of the us military business complex the sub plots were somewhat predictable but the final interweaving of story lines made them all worthwhile i can understand why this film was not terribly popular in the us but for the rest of the world it is a timely tale
<START> the name of nick stahl the young cast and the attractive cover of the vhs made me buy and watch this flick expecting to see a good teen slash movie what a crap the full of clichÃ©s screenplay the dialogs and the performances are awful dreadful very bad terrible horrendous Â summarizing a complete waste of time there is no horror black humor only an absolutely boring story with shameful plot points the film begins with six characters indeed three couples together like a group of friends but indeed very nasty persons that seems to be enemies playing a ridiculous senseless game called taboo and with each one of them writing yes or no for certain taboo issues that is it no previous development of the characters the viewer does not know who they are their motives and relationship then there is an ellipsis to one year later and the same group is gathered together in a new years eve party insulting each other in a very sordid way but the plot and the twists are so ridiculous predictable mediocre and unbelievable that do not deserve any additional line in my review one advice only do not waste your time or money on this garbage you will certainly regret my vote is one awful br br title brazil taboo Â jogando com o assassino taboo Â playing with the killer
<START> as a rule a full moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a film but because i've enjoyed jeffrey combs in other films i gave it a shot br br it's not bad not great but that's something else the film involves a struggle with a mystic evil brother who wants to dominate the worlds and the title character dr mordrid also has to deal with people and authorities in the mundane world which he does successfully br br possible spoilers follow br br dr mordrid can travel between dimensions and does so to find a companion guarding a fortress however the guard has been blinded his eyes are ruined pits so the wizard passes his hands across the other's eyes and hey presto his eyes have been restored this sort of healing apparently only works with eyes br br later mordred and his brother animate a couple of animal skeletons in a museum to fight guess which one wins br br however side from that the picture isn't at all bad though much like a comic book dr mordred's more human adventures are okay and combs plays the role convincingly br br i've seen lots worse
