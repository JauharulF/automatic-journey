<START> i think this is one of the weakest of the kenneth branagh shakespearian works after such great efforts as much ado about nothing etc i thought this was poor the cast was weaker alicia silverstone nivoli mcelhone but my biggest gripe was that they messed with the bard's work and cut out some of the play to put in the musical dance sequences br br you just don't do shakespeare and then mess with the play sorry but that is just wrong i love some cole porter just like the next person but jeez don't mess with the shakespeare skip this and watch prospero's books if you want to see a brilliant shakespearean adaptation of the tempest
<START> this movie was lame lame lame what a build up what a let down all form no substance a terrible waste of talent and time would not recommend it to my husband's dog who will watch anything
<START> first off i would like to point out that while i am not an expert the way the trial was handled will insult your intelligence firstly the prosecution never proved that 'facilitated learning' actually works irresponsible for both the prosecution because they can get an appeal and the defense for not acting on this as another commenter said facilitated learning was proved untrue secondly they used terry as the translator who has personal interest and even will testify in the trial which is just stupid if the court had allowed him to testify that way they would have brought in someone neutral otherwise they would be just asking for an appeal thirdly this child was never asked specific questions about the defendant by the prosecution birthmarks details of the event etc and even when asked by the defense specific questions like when it started he could not answer if that isn't reasonable doubt i don't know what is and a competent lawyer would have gotten an acquittal br br bottom line it starts off well with the pressures of being the parent of a child with autism but the trial makes this movie wholly unbelievable
<START> this isn't one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology or being dated issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with but rather a review on the story telling which most of us are truly interested in br br the plot is about a combination of wwii allied and german navy members and two civilians the hero and heroine who are thrust together on a german u boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs br br the manipulations aren't so bad by film standards and we know from the plot that realism isn't going to be high what films like this need are credible and likable characters along with some semblance of reason in the actions br br this film lacks both for a full length film only 6 characters are given any time and 3 of them are barely looked into mcclure's hero is beyond routine and doesn't make much sense in any era br br the female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered but the riddle is not much of a riddle and we could care less br br a lot of failure in a film that should have been better even for its time
<START> i had never heard of this adam sandler movie until i saw it on the wall at blockbuster being an adam sandler fan at the time i rented it honestly i could only watch about 30 mins of it it was terrible do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public i honestly hope this movie goes oop soon and i hope it stays that way
<START> growing up with the beast wars transformers i wasn't very familiar with the original transformers and now that i have seen the awesome movie and now that i have seen the older cartoon on which it's based i have to say i like the original cartoon and the live action movie more than beast wars br br not that i don't like the bw characters i just think that characters like optimus prime are better than optimus primal br br i mean autobots transform and roll out sounds a lot better than maximals maximize the voice of the original optimus prime still makes me a strong believer that he's a real commander more so than optimus primal br br besides powermaster optimus prime is a lot more powerful than optimal optimus just look on the web br br megatron in the bw character seemed more like a humorous version of the more evil version of him in the original series br br besides what's cooler robots changing into animals or robots changing into vehicles and spaceships gimme the original transformers any day over beast wars
<START> this show is about three little girls d j stephanie and michelle their mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father danny invites his brother in law jesse and his old friend joey so the whole show is about living life the girls go through life's troubles and have life lessons they develop crushes boyfriends and many more the whole show is basically about to go with the flow you do not have to hold grudges you just have to let it go i think this show is really good and fun to watch i grew up watching this show and still watch it today i am glad they still air this show on television i watch it almost every day i rate it 10 10
<START> caution may contain spoilers br br i've seen this movie 3 times i've liked it every time upon seeing it again i'm always reminded of how good it is an hbo tv movie very well done like most of their movies are this would've gotten oscars for it's performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for tv br br as i'm sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here this is the story of serial murderer andrei chikatilo he murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former soviet union 3 victims were buried couldn't be found so he was only convicted of 52 out of 53 of his murders the story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst victor burakov played to perfection by stephen rea a man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks his part is essential to be sure there is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in america investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain frustration according to this acct burakov worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it he followed the case to its conclusion 3 years later in this scene his superior general fetisov played by donald sutherland actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he should've given him a break sooner br br rea's performance is so well done he doesn't overact chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer he is a man with passion but doesn't show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies he only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances rea does so much with his face his eyes he doesn't need to overact he just is his character so frustrated after so long at one point driven to frustration he actually says he'd rather find 3 at one time than none in a year of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die he just wants some clues to catch this man rea makes us feel for this man he makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility br br a mutant to be sure chikatilo's childhood was one which produces such monsters the character of chikatilo is very well done by jeffrey demunn he somehow impossible though it may seem elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong either way his performance is very well done br br donald sutherland as colonel fetisov later promoted to general also does a great job he starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that doesn't seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking burakov but he eventually becomes more than just an assistant he actually actively participates in helping burakov there is also a very nice turn by max von sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for br br although this movie deals with a morbid grotesque and violent story it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself all around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay the screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does give factual events place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people behind the facts br br 9 out of 10 stars
<START> the remake of h b halicki's classic seventies chase film is simply horrible along with vanishing point gone in 60 seconds represent the quintessential car chase films the remake takes the original and stands it on its head whereas halicki gave us 75 car chase and 25 supporting drama in giss 2000 we get 25 car chase and 75 supporting drama cage as super man saves his brother kisses the girl mtv edits tits and ass save your money rent the original at least halicki didn't live to see his baby he wrote produced directed and starred in the '74' film degraded in this manner
<START> carlo verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism br br then something happened and he turned into just another dull holier than thou director br br il mio miglior nemico can more or less be summarized in one line working class kind and warm while upper class snob and devious but love wins in the end br br such a trite clichÃ¨ for such a smart director br br there isn't really too much to talk about in the movie every character is a walking stereotype the self made man who forgets his roots but who'll become good again the scorned wife the rebellious rich girl who falls for the honest but poor guy acting is barely average br br severely disappointing under every aspect
<START> was there a single positive to this film critics who knew nothing of video games could spot the gaming errors made no damage taken with damage clearly visible towards the beginning being a primary example br br and i may have missed something but wasn't super mario bros 3 suppose to be a game that had never played before well if that is the case and i did not miss anything how did fred savage's character and even the girl know so much about the game already we're talking things that some people don't know about by their second or third play through br br beyond the factual and gaming errors there is the general low quality of the film itself nothing here is honestly very memorable the kid wasn't even that good at playing video games in the footage they showed a lot of kids i knew way back in those days were significantly more experienced on top of all this the acting and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points the characters are bland and completely uninteresting the 'wizard' the youngest child is a very silent completely dry child clichÃ© of a little kid who almost never talks because of a trauma it isn't that this is unrealistic it's the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to actually even begin to form a plot that would exceed even 30 minutes br br honestly the only value that is to be found here is that of a nostalgic nature if you grew up with this movie you're going to like it whether it was good or not it was about kids playing video games and at the time you saw it you likely had an obsession with the nes as well but unless you loved it as a kid there just isn't anything that's going to keep you interested and very little that will prevent you from turning it off br br no sir i didn't like it
<START> please help the economy spend your money elsewhere the synopsis of the movie is the first lady has her husband assassinated because he was cheating on her that's it undetected by anyone except cuba and angie she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about and gets away completely free br br some specific points are particularly hilarious while standing in front of the president cuba a deflects the assassin's bullet which then enters the back of the president's head br br cuba and angie watch film from a news camera and they see a clue they go to great lengths to protect the film believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film br br cuba speaks with a presidential staff member the psm comments that there was no conspiracy cuba claims there was more than one person involved the psm then rants that the conspiracy includes the fbi the cia and the nsa gosh i wonder is the psm is involved br br ms archer the first lady is a craptacular artist cuba can't make out a painting and she says you're too close stand back look from a different perspective look from my perspective can anyone miss that clue
<START> i must say that during my childhood i'm quite proud of a lot of the movies i've rented the exception being theodore rex talk about the all time swindler movie in any actor's resume could you just imagine what whoopie's fired agent must have told her to sign on to this piece of crap hey whoop you ever seen that show dinosaurs yeah well they're making a movie out of it and you get to see germany after that that agent must have referenced star wars a lot br br this movie was so bad i figured whoopie must have bought out every copy of this film and had it destroyed i just wish she could have done the same thing to my memory because my sister still gives me crap for watching that movie i mean c'mon i'll even admit i watched mr nanny and kazzam in theaters good reasons why i gave up on both hulk hogan and shaq for awhile yet this one sticks out in my mind as the worst of my childhood and the biggest rental regret of my life and that was 16 years ago i'm 24 now if you want to do the math br br whenever i think of my all time list of worst movies i don't even mention this one because like a raped step child i try hard to repress that it ever happened screw you whoopie just be glad people only acknowledge eddie and sister act 2 as your worst you lucky stiff
<START> i bought this movie a few days ago and thought that it would be a pretty shitty film but when i popped it into the dvd player it surprised me in a very good way james belushi plays very well as bill the mouth manuccie but especially timothy dalton plays a very good roll as the sheriff the 'end' scene in the house of bill is very excellent good camera work nice dialogues and very good acting bill the mouth manuccie has stolen 12 million dollars from the mafia together with his wife he lives in south carolina in a witness protection program but the mafia tracks him down and wants the 12 million dollar bill can only trust the only person he knows inside out himself
<START> i saw rachel's attic thinking that i would be in for an enjoyably visceral ride however it was not to be the case visceral yes but enjoyable that would be a big fat no in fact the only reason that i gave it a 3 is due to the fact that gunnar hansen appears ever so briefly as one of the film's reprehensible characters how they ever lured mr hansen into this piece of work i'll never know the story idea is interesting but poorly executed the direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre the only thing that is worse than that are the special effects yikes i've seen better effects in a grade school play give it up mr w it's time for a career change i hear they're hiring at mel's diner there are very few well made inde movies coming out of michigan and rachel's attic isn't one of them
<START> currently on metoo's new schedule at 4 pm on weekdays right after maverick and right before wild wild west followed by star trek br br don't know if i ever actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on but i'm really captivated by it offbeat unusual surreal stories set in a mythical west kind of the naked city of westerns br br and the guest stars are there dan duryea lyle bettger brian donlevy macdonald carey rick jason as a treacherous mexican a young dick van patten jack lord noah berry jr as a colorful mexican martha hyer marguerite chapman even ann robinson war of the worlds gloria talbott i married a monster from outer space br br it ran for eight seasons over 200 episodes from january 1959 to december 1965 br br eric fleming is quite remarkable as trail boss gil favor the most stolid man that's ever lived with the code of honor of a samurai and just the right balance between toughness and open handedness i would vote for him for president any day p s he had a very interesting biography http www imdb com name nm0281661 br br and a young clint eastwood is quite striking as his impulsive right hand rowdy yates also veteran western actor and country music figure the immortal one eyed one horned flying purple people eater sheb wooley is there as seasoned scout pete nolan and paul brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a cook you could ask for as wishbone br br and then there's that great theme song performed by the immortal frankie laine between that and the maverick theme i've got western theme songs running through my head all day br br i look forward to every episode i'm collecting the whole set a good time not to mention a moo ving experience is always guaranteed as one waits to see if the boys will get their difficulties straightened out before the commercial br br rollin' rollin' rollin'
<START> though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in austin sxsw film just as we were getting tired of things like shakespeare in love and elizabeth this movie deserves an audience an inside look at the staging of the scottish play as actors call macbeth when producing it to avoid the curse this is a crisp efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe with a wonderfully evocative score and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest this is a quiet gem not world class but totally satisfying
<START> this is far worse than those awful laurel and hardy cartoons of the 60s they were terrible but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then stan and ollie resurgence new audiences had rediscovered the pair's comedic genius and the cartoons were mind numbing garbage geared to cash in on children's interest it was to be expected but how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of i can't even think of a word i'm sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another laurel and hardy revival but you can't inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing the impressionists i hesitate to call them actors do a vegas act and that's where it belongs the plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days trying to stretch out two reel ideas for a feature if this film was someone's first exposure to the real laurel and hardy i'm sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo's reputation as senility gone amok the only movie i hate worse than this is i spit on your grave and you know these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to stan and ollie
<START> happenstance is the most new york feeling parisian film i've seen since when the cat's away chacun cherche son chat br br a film from last year released now to capitalize on the attention audrey tatou is getting for amelie its french title is more apt le battement d'ailes du papillon the beating of the butterfly's wings as in summarizing chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives br br tatou's gamine ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures and because she's part of a large multi ethnic ensemble so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that i wasn't sure if they were doing that or not br br but i loved how urban the coincidences were from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around cafÃ©s br br the subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once br br originally written 12 8 2001
<START> murder in mesopotamia i have always considered one of the better poirot books as it is very creepy and has an ingenious ending there is no doubt that the tv adaptation is visually striking with some lovely photography and a very haunting music score as always david suchet is impeccable as hercule poirot the comedic highlight of the episode being poirot's battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night and hugh fraser is good as the rather naive captain hastings the remainder of the cast turn in decent performances but are careful not to overshadow the two leads a danger in some christie adaptations some of the episode was quite creepy a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as five little pigs an episode that i enjoyed a lot more than this one what made it creepy in particular putting aside the music was when louise leidner sees the ghostly face through the window about the adaptation it was fairly faithful to the book but i will say that there were three things i didn't like the main problem was the pacing it is rather slow and there are some scenes where very little happens i didn't like the fact also that they made joseph mercado a murderer in the book i see him as a rather nervous character but the intervention of the idea of making him a murderer and under developing that made him a less appealing character though i am glad they didn't miss his drug addiction i also noticed that the writers left out the fact that mrs mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the murderer's next victim the other thing that wasn't so impressive was that i felt that it may have been more effective if the adaptation had been in the viewpoint of amy leatheran like it was in the book amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation on the whole despite some misjudgements on the writers' behalf i liked murder in mesopotamia 7 10 bethany cox
