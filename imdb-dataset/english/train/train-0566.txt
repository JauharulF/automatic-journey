<START> in this movie joe pesci slams dunks a basketball joe pesci br br and being consistent the rest of the script is equally not believable br br pesci is a funny guy which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar but the other roles were pretty bad the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people which wasn't even well played instead of the man being an archetypal villain he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs then there's the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something i don't even remember she was that forgettable br br anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film or at least one of those millions of media minions who can't critique efficiently you know the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6 br br stay away far away and shame on comedy central where i saw this film they usually pick better
<START> picture bride paints a realistic and moving portrait of what it must have been like for japanese men brought to hawaii at the turn of the 19th century to work in the sugar cane fields most came planning to return to their homeland but few were ever able to do so equally movingly portrayed is the fate of japanese women some as young as fifteen or sixteen who were sent as promised brides to men they knew only through photographs that often were 10 or 15 years out of date or were of some other younger man they too worked long hard hours in the fields while fighting homesickness and to preserve their dignity br br director hatta's portrayal of one picture bride's courage and perseverance struggling to survive in a strange land and alien society under great physical duress is ultimately inspirational and uplifting a story of moral and cultural survival there is a grandness and magnificence of sweep of character and landscape in picture bride that captures the alluring beauty as well as violent harshness of colonial hawaii this is a film that is emotionally intellectually and artistically rewarding
<START> ok so it's not a masterpiece like the godfather but it doesn't have to be the only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times if it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times it has accomplished its purpose i laughed out loud and left with a smile i feel like i got my money's worth
<START> not to be confused with the british black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994 but this shallow grave is a worthy addition to the 80's backwoods slasher br br the plot goes 4 sorority girls from a convent are planning the spring break of a lifetime in florida but they're plans are put on hold when one of them witness a man murdering a local woman and when he realizes that he was seen well let's just say it becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse and things get even worse when he turns out to be the local sheriff br br shallow grave in my opinion is one of the more enjoyable slashers that came out in the 80's especially the late 80's which was when the slashers kinda went downhill this was one of the few that didn't and this movie should be more well known it's a pity it isn't this is one film that actually confounds stereotypes just try guessing who the final girl is going to be i got it totally wrong the principle cast are all likable and it's one of those movies that you kinda hope they all get away which of course they don't this coupled with the fluffiness of the film's first half an hour jars in a good way with some flashes of real nastiness the second murder provides a real jolt and some unexpected sleaziness even though this isn't a high budget thriller i didn't expect the topless scene where a woman is strangled with her own bra accompanied by a hysterical religious radio broadcast in a film from this late in the 80's br br there are one or two bad things about this movie well not bad just minor like the sub plot with the two teenage boys which doesn't go anywhere and the ending which was stupid and plus the deputy inability to follow logic there aren't any sharp implements in shallow grave but to my mind at least it's a slasher flick through and through the scenes where the girls are hunted through the woods by the malevolent sheriff are tense and exciting br br all in all a very enjoyable and worthwhile slasher with great performances from all four of the main girls and that psycho sheriff
<START> this is pretty much the first jason scott lee film i've seen i say pretty much because i have also seen soldier in which he plays the villain but from what i've heard it's not considered a jason scott lee film this however is and if this is any indication of the quality of such films i won't be seeing any of the others lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist as the lead he's awful he gets in a fight with random no name characters every few minutes of the film probably because the script writer couldn't figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film the villain is the only character with even a hint of personality and aside from the fact that he's certifiably insane he barely seems like a villain at all the majority of the film is basically lee chasing the villain through time or maybe it's the other way around i can't say for sure and i definitely wouldn't watch it again to make sure the effects are not completely horrible but it's close the title comes from the popular idea of using a time machine to go and kill hitler somehow the film screws up that interesting idea as well the plot is too complicated for its own good the pacing is poor i can't think of one positive thing to say about this film i really can't it's simply too formulaic and pointless if only i had a time machine so i could go back and prevent this film from ever being made no never mind i just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible listen to the negative reviewers avoid this turkey i recommend this to fans of lee and no one else if you're looking for a quality film well this isn't it that's for sure 1 10
<START> i don't watch much porn but i love porn stars and i love gory movies so when i heard about a porn star gore movie i was really excited of course that was years ago and when i heard about all the trouble with making and finishing the movie i never thought i'd actually get to see it but i did and i'm not ashamed to admit i loved it even with all its flaws br br first the flaws the story is set in ireland and is called samhain but the story it seemed to want to tell is about the sawney beane clan from scotland so why not just set it there and skip the third grade report about samhain irish immigrants halloween also it breaks its own rules by stating that you're safe on the trails but then the cannibal mutants just start running amok everywhere it's never clear how many cannibals we're dealing with there's a big stone castle that's obviously ancient yet no one's noticed it before the self conscious horror film references are annoying and so are the characters the heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that include a character she never met the ending makes no sense br br so what works the gore sure i would have liked more but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that wasn't afraid to be nothing more than a gore movie two murders are waay over the top and taylor hayes has a nice disgusting scene the two wild murders are even given extended shots on the dvd i've always been of the mind that gore can overcome a stupid story and evil breed reinforced that
<START> i rented this movie on the merits of what the trailer showed and of course sir anthony hopkins br br if jackson pollack teamed up with david lynch and timothy leary to make a movie this would be the end result i don't think i've seen a movie like it that made an lsd trip look like an episode of sesame street br br it's a bunch of set pieces where the characters flash in and out of reality or various realities and the film doesn't culminate into anything until the last 5 minutes where all of a sudden it makes sense i wrote a scathing review on my movie review blog that essentially gives everything away and i won't do that here it's a well acted piece of cinema and the soundtrack was written by sir anthony hopkins and let me say this if there's one redeeming feature to this film it's the music it fits perfectly some of the dialogue is unbelievably good and unbelievably bad all at the same time br br i enjoyed parts of this movie i truly did and once you get to the end of it you'll actually figure out what's truly going on it's unfortunate that you have to wade through 2 hours of crazy to get to a salient point which minimizes the effect of the entire movie br br i give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film isn't the acting it's everything
<START> as much as i dislike saying 'me too' in response to other comments it's completely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following 90 br br having been banned somewhere doesn't make a film watchable just because it doesn't resemble a hollywood product does not make it credible br br worse yet in addition to no discernible plot other than there are lots of muddy places in russia and many people even very old women drink lots of vodka a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating i'm in to my second package of rolaids br br as for spoilers well the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldn't write one if i tried br br don't waste your time or money and don't confuse this with good russian cinema
<START> advertised by channel seven in australia as the untold story this miniseries undoes itself in the first five minutes by washing over the titular character's childhood and adolescence in less time than a good director will use to set up a single event this cowardice and self censorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series and is ultimately responsible for its failure br br robert carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of the twentieth century but he is hamstrung by two things the lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves his northern uk heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance and the dialogue is at times truly abysmal apparently acknowledging the fact that hitler was raised in a catholic family is off limits but insulting millions of vikings and their descendants by having carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about valhalla is quite okay well here's a clue for the writers any person familiar with viking mythology will tell you that valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might in battle two things that the nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing until we can wake up to ourselves and realise that the reason hitler has never been excommunicated from the catholic church is because it would require the embarassing acknowledgement that he was once a member we will never learn what this awful period of the world's history has to teach us br br so now that we've managed to insult vikings and the citizens of scandinavian countries in this sham you'd think the series would stop there but it doesn't stockard channing's listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrow raising given that her voice is heard and her face seen for about thirty seconds at the most during the opening credits making it patently transparent that more footage of hitler's early days were shot but not included because of a typical nanny state fear of offending someone it is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into hilter's character do not feature him at all br br until we learn to stop sugar coating the truth and realise that the citizenry of germany was mostly unopposed to hitler's views and not necessarily through ignorance we will never learn to deal with the fact that subversions of democracy yes germany was a democracy pre hitler can occur anywhere we are doomed that's the one thing this mini series got right in portraying unfortunately that element is lost in attempts to make hitler's religious beliefs appear those of a much more valiant people and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter david letterman's show had it pegged when they ran short satirical segments about the series they really might as well have made a family sitcom with him as the star that's how badly it was written br br all in all this politically correct farce of a bio pic is worth no points but i gave it two because robert carlyle definitely deserves better material than this and he is about the only thing in it that works
<START> this is probably the best horror film made since ed wood died br br i can't spoil the ending because i have absolutely no idea what happened i'll try my best though there are some kind of lesbian vampires but they keep swapping bodies so any character might or might not be the character you're supposed to think it is or it might be a lesbian vampire br br sound confusing it's not as confusing as you might think since none of the characters make any sense to begin with there's no plot no character development and random people show up speak a few lines and then disappear never to be heard from again there are also zombies who are possibly the enemies of the vampires but there's also a dream within a dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital so maybe none of this actually happened and it's all the main character's hallucination br br the upside both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly the special effects are simply mind boggling i particularly liked the incredibly slow awkward fight sequences everyone has a really silly canadian accent which adds to the general level of hilarity br br well worth the price of rental we laughed until we cried
<START> this movie was terrible i thought with all the some what decent actors it would be better don't waste your time eva longoria parker was awful she should stick to desperate housewives paul rudd is becoming a b actor the mess he made in the movie i could never be your woman was the epitome of what i'm saying and lake bell she was cute but definitely in need of some more acting lessons watch just like heaven with reese witherspoon it was a tad better or any other ghost movie you will be grateful to not have wasted your precious time ps i love you is also a good from beyond the grave romance time to start watching movies rated over 7 out of 10 and listen to the people who have already seen it
<START> this film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew based on shielah graham's autobiography it seems like the powers that be couldn't leave well enough alone they couldn't decide if this was to be graham's story or fitzgerald's story and also how much they should soft pedal whoever's story it turned out to be so a film that could have been a story about two fascinating fitzgerald and notorious ms graham personalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959 clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing however and this saved the film for me kerr has never looked lovelier and peck is as always a very handsome man they truly make a beautiful mature couple and i only wish they had better material to work with there is one scene that does work scott goes after shielah while in a drunken state and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs other than that the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other wald produced soaps of the 1950 peyton place the best of everything
<START> the original exploitation classic though far from enjoyable on almost any level concerning some guys who turn cats into human flesh eating monsters because the cat food they make is made with people is remade with scifi elements added the cats can't get enough and when the flesh tainted food runs out the cats turn on their owners poorly put together on almost every level this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to actually play movie theaters in the early 1970's updated with alien cat and dog races battling for supremacy director ted mikel is a hack but is so lovable a person i generally like the guy thanks to his smile inducing interviews and commentary tracks that you can pretty much excuse the garbage he mostly turned out mikels wanted to make films and he didn't care how they turned out so long as he was producing something more power to him but i wish he wouldn't subject us to his home movies
<START> atlantis is a new and right step for a disney feature it's a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like atlantis i didn't have any expectations for this film but after watching it i don't quite understand why this film got so bad reviews even in my country the reviewers weren't positive br br atlantis is not a perfect movie but still one of disney's greatest even i doubt that this film ever will get disney classic reputation well that's another case it's funny to think that this sci fi movie was directed by the same directors as beauty and the beast and hunchback so kirk wise and gary trousdale are trying to get away from their monster movies reputation he he i'm just kidding br br well enough nonsense atlantis is a watchable exiting and very enjoyable film even this film it's a pg rated action feature it's also suitable for kids in my opinion parents who mean the opposite don't kill me for writing this he he br br the story is a little predictable but it doesn't ruin the movie the comic book inspired animation it's suitable for the film and set's a departure from the usual disney style it's colorful dark and detailed the deep canvas sequences are pretty impressive the film is also funny sometimes even i more giggled than laugh through the movie spoilers the characters of this film are also very likable but unfortunately there isn't enough screen time to get to know everybody so some characters are left behind spoilers br br the score of james newton howard is absolutely great it's daring and exotic spoiler the most impressive about this film is how they're making the atlantean language sound very natural ethnic and authentic it's really awesome spoilers over br br the script is tight and well written but still the there are some questions left unanswered in the story but luckily there are not so much of them br br so do you're self a favor don't listen to the reviewers and watch atlantis cause it's waiting for you
<START> i came at this film with high expectations i was aware of greenaway's work and 'the tempest' and was interested in an adaptation i first wanted to switch off after ten minutes but felt that it would be unfair there was a representation of a storm but where in your mind do you conceive a small boy peeing over a toy boat it is symbolic of what i continued another ten minutes my finger twitching over the 'off' button somewhere something would capture my interest this is not shakespeare it is not cinema there is a time and place for it but i will not waste my time and there is no place for it in my studies of shakespeare after twenty five minutes i gave up and that was the end i then read all the comments on this website and the pretentiousness of the film is only matched by its defendants 'its a painting then put it in a gallery' 'it's a ballet keep it on the stage then' shakespeare can be done intelligently and the plays were performed to mass audiences they were accessible and this version helps put a wedge between shakespeare and the general population at large and i do not think that the bard would be happy with that
<START> the story is about ankush abhay deol who is professional marriage witness in short he acts as a witness for couples in marriage registration office and megha soha ali khan who ran away from her home at nainital to get married to her love interest dhiraj shayan munshi the story starts with megha waiting at the marriage registration office for dhiraj to show up but for some reason he does not show up so ankush comes in the picture here who had approached megha with the intention of earning rs 200 for his witness job and he ends up helping her by providing shelter to her ankush grows on his side by working in a bank as an agent 8230 ankush falls in love with megha and she too falls in love with him or kind of love both agree for the marriage and dhiraj comes back in the picture unexpected circumstances happen actually i should say expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then 8230 br br actually the movie story is bit different than the movies we see and i do not think so it will be accepted by the masses but if you are a movie freak like me and love to watch something different then you will definitely like the movie the movie is just an innocent love story drafted very well by the characters of abhay deol and soha ali khan the characters are so natural that you feel as if things are happening to the guy next door the background music of the film also plays a very good role it is just too good the way delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling br br so let's cut it out and sum it up br br story a very common story carried very well and transformed to a wonderful experience br br music well as it was himesh reshammiya creation so i did not expect much but still i liked couple of songs of the movie including the qawwali br br acting abhay deol was the most impressive very natural and innocent acting but he should stay away from singing in the songs soha ali khan she is a doll a very cute doll i must say again very innocent and natural acting and these both actors perfectly fit into their characters apart from these two shayan munshi needs some acting lessons and may be few layers of fat to cover the bones other actors did their job well br br stars i would also give it 3 5 stars out of 5 you will enjoy the movie if watched in the theatre i would recommend watching it in theatre if you are a movie freak and accept uncommon stories otherwise wait for the dvd to arrive the movie will definitely won't be liked by the masses and the business it can do is from word of mouth publicity
<START> well i have to say that i have waited for it to come br br i won't try to spoil it and quite a few people have really brilliantly spoken of the pilot on the other hand i'm not quite sure to understand the detractors who claim themselves to be bsg fans and not like the pilot br br what the frack did they expect the background is setting 50 years before bsg we are there o assist at the birth of the cylons see the life of the adama family has we already knew some of it from bsg get a deeper explanation of the caprican population and its perception of the other colonies and potentially the origins of the gods belief of the human and the unique god belief of the cylons br br i do not expect the same profusion of special effect or space opera as the in the previous series i make the difference between the two although i know that caprica will reinforce bsg br br this is 1h30 of promising start i believe as well that this will put pressure for the scenarios to be as good as bsg i expect a lot from the following but i have no reasons to doubts that we will learn a lot more br br watching the dvd's deleted scene also gives more material for your brain to chew on br br looking forward to january 2010
<START> i stumbled across this act i by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago this was'nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned it amazed me it intimidated me it shocked me i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later i happened to think about it again then went and bought both acts they were even better than i had experienced at first br br my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime warranting tanks and heavy artillery it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda it certainly has not been shown as such br br i don't think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this but regarding the story there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused
<START> there's something about every hammer movie i see that really takes me into a new fantasy world in the world of hammer movies anything can happen guardian of the abyss is one of those types of movies it adventures deep into the occult and hypnosis to bring a different type of horror fantasy all in all an unforgettable movie 7 5 10
<START> wow why would anybody make a sequel to an already rancid film half past dead was a bad movie but at least at had an idea of what it wanted to be hpd2 has no clue of what it wants to be it just exists on screen for reasons i cant explain spoiler the whole movie is this twitch played by kurupt of tha dogg pound gets transferred to another jail where there might be a box filled with gold bricks buried in the jail a riot breaks out between rival inmates one of them gets shot by a guy named cortez and cortez plans his escape during a conjugal visit twitch's fiancÃ©e and burke's played by bill goldberg daughter get kidnapped by cortez and are held in an execution room burke reluctantly befriends twitch and they end up getting into trouble with the idiotic inmates while finding out that cortez has their loved ones br br opinion this is the most unnecessary sequel since universal soldier the return the script is terrible the acting is horrendous the dialog is a joke and everybody in this movie is a caricature look i know it was low budget film but that is not an excuse for these guys to not put effort into what they do nobody in this movie believes in the characters they play nobody in this movie can be taken seriously as an actor kurupt should be ashamed of himself his character twitch is pretty much a spineless minstrel puppet who spends most of his time posing while getting jacked up by burke or the other inmates bill goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the movie as if he had to take a phd pretty huge dump the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie hpd2 is pretty boring even when action is happening don't let anybody tell you that this movie is somewhat decent it stinks and is a prime reason why people despise follywood
