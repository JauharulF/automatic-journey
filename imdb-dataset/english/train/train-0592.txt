<START> brilliant execution in displaying once and for all this time in the venue of politics of how good intentions do actually pave the road to hell excellent
<START> this is why i so love this website i saw this film in the 1980's on british television over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life with barely a few key words to remember it by i traced the film here and much information including the fact it's about to become an off broadway musical br br interestingly unlike the previous comment maker i do not remember finding this film sad or exploitative on the contrary the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength honour and dignity ironic you may think considering the squalor of their lives maybe it's because i live in britain where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding i saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit deep and profound humour whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect in a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a 'cult' over the years as it faded in my mind it shone the brightest above all others as a one off brilliant outstanding televisual experience it was such a deeply private expose it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a new york musical but perhaps somewhere the daughter will be amused by such an outcome it is she who will have the last laugh maybe they made a musical out of her before you jackie o'
<START> when you're making a thriller about witchcraft i believe you should do everything you can to help the audience suspend its disbelief in order for the movie to work some pictures rosemary's baby for example have accomplished this others like necromancy haven't and the potentially scary material comes across as corny and goofy this film does have some atmospheric moments but about half the dialogue is hard to make out sometimes it's poorly recorded at other times just incomprehensible and orson welles who gets top billing has a role that is so beneath him that you have to assume he was desperate for the work or maybe he was simply having fun 1 2
<START> this is a fair little show about the paranormal although it feels as if art bell and his ilk figured out how to carve a career out of the attitude that carl kolchak exemplified of course there probably wouldn't be an x files if this show hadn't prepped this audience for it so well darren mcgavin is not exactly the super heroic type but he is a plausible enough guy to deliver heroic deeds check out his work on some of those old alfred hitchcock presents here he is the main attraction there doesn't seem to be a girlfriend or wife who's a distraction in fact there isn't a whole lot of sex appeal to the show something i'm noticing as well is that the pacing isn't really suspenseful in a typical way there's a lot of throwaway humor to this show sometimes its just pokey to get to the climax there's a thread from this show coming all the way up to the present mad men show in terms of style not that david chase writes mad men but the people that worked under him on the sopranos definitely have emulated and inherited his serio comic tone
<START> when this film opened back in 1976 legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain it was widely considered a failure i vividly remember ebert giving it one star and it was supposedly booed at cannes br br apparently these people didn't understand the movie which is not that hard to comprehend since it's very esoteric dark and layered in ways that still astound me reading through many of the reviews here i find even after about 7 8 viewings over the years many elements of the film i had previously glossed over but even without understanding much the psychological underpinnings of the story it's still a cracking suspenser even if you just take the escalating paranoia and persecution that overtakes polanski's title character like a tsunami wave over the course of it's two hour running time br br examining the source material an excellent novella by underrated novelist roland topor uncovers more intriguing layers polanski's trekovsky is a milquetoast of the highest order though he seems at first to be yet another mild everyday soul one gradually realizes he is one of those people who seems to aimlessly drift through life letting it direct him he seems to have few strong feelings about his likes and dislikes he finds himself gently pushed this way and that but never seems to get too bent out of shape regardless this vague sort of wishy washy ness is more noticeable in the novel than the movie but there are hints of it early in the film too br br making a play for the apartment of a woman one mademouiselle choule who is in the hospital recovering from a recent suicide attempt appears to be the most daring thing he has attempted even effectively haggling down the price of the deposit in the bargain he soon finds however that he is paying for his good thing in more ways than he cares as he finds himself in the center of maelstrom created by a building full of neurotic control freaks who are hypersensitive to even the slightest sign of human life such as a footstep in the night or a knock on the door br br instead of taking a stand though trelkovsky becomes increasingly alienated by the situation and overtaken by paranoia and a sense of persecution he becomes obsessed with choule imagining himself to be like her dressing like her etc as his own personality rapidly begins to be wiped away by his own insanity br br if anyone has ever doubted polanski's fearlessness as an artist they'd be well advised to see this film his trademark black humor is prominently and sometimes embarrassingly on display here and god bless him he makes himself the butt of it it's a tour de force performance in one of the richest riskiest most gothic horror movies ever made that more people haven't seen it is a true crime
<START> for my opinion the middle of the film specially the love scene is a bit too long but the whole time you can imagine this desert feeling but the best what made this film unforgettable are the great explosion pictures their color slowmotion and the pink floyd music are unique in filmhistory br br destruction in its propper and popular form
<START> does any one know what the 2 sports cars were i think robert stack's might have been a masseratti rock hudson's character told his father he was taking a job in iraq isn't that timely i have had dorthy malone in my spank bank most of my life maybe this was the film that impressed me loren bacall sure did have some chops in this film and probably out acted malone but malones's part made a more sensational impact so she got the oscar for best supporting role was loren's part considered a leading role old man hadley character was was probably a pretty common picture of tycoons of his era in that he was a regular guy who made it big in an emerging industry but in building a whole town he had forgotten his children to have his wife bring them up in time being widowed he realized that they were all he really had and they were spoiled rotten looking for attention so rather than try to relate to his children he blew his head off an ancient morality tale but seriously what were those sports cars
<START> saving grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun i mean the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness it was the first movie i watched with this theme drugs marijuana that is not really criticizing it only making jokes about it grace trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in u k and has many financial problems because of her dead husband who committed suicide since he was full of debts the problem is that grace who imagined to have some money saved for her discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband's pounds in debts to not lose all of her things specially her house that she loves so much she never worked before and is in a tragic situation until matthew her gardener who is very found of smoking pot decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale
<START> well done al gore you have become the first person to have made 1 billion dollars of the global warming lie just like all the other man made fable's in the world this one is up there with the best lies to have sucked in so many people sure polution is not a good thing and i would love for all the tree's to keep on growing but global warming is a business it employes thousands of people that are all very mislead br br google it there are just to many things that just don't add up but well done al you failed as a politician but went on to make lots of money sucking in the world br br whats next santa is real
<START> it's obvious that the people who made 'dead at the box office' love b movie horror overt references to the genre are peppered throughout from stock characters the authority figure who doesn't believe the monstrous invasion is really happening to kevin smith style discussions to reenacting duane jones' last moments from 'night of the living dead' not once but twice br br unfortunately it takes more than love to make a good movie br br the staging and shot choice are unexciting and unimaginative while a common admonition in film school is to avoid 'mastershot theatre ' telling the story completely in a wide master shot here we find the obverse as in several sequences it's hard to figure out the spatial relationships between characters as the story is told in a series of medium shots with no establishing shot to tie it together editing is drab and basic and at times there are unmotivated cuts the lighting is flat and sometimes muddy making the scenes in the darkened theatre hard to make out was there lighting or was this shot with available light only some shots are out of focus the dialogue is trite and the performances for the most part one note isaiah robinson shows some energy and screen presence as curtis and the fellow playing the projectionist has some pleasantly dickish line readings michael allen williams as the theater manager and casey kirkpatrick as enthusiastic film geek eric have some nice moments the premise is silly even for a b horror flick also it's too bad dr eisner was unaware of project paperclip he could've saved himself a lot of trouble the 'zombies' are non threatening and their makeup is unconvincing although the chunky zombie trying to get a gumball out of the machine raised a smile for a zombie fan film there is very little blood or violence although what there is is handled pretty well the incidental music while stylistically uneven is kind of nice at times and there are some good foley effects the 'time warp' parody was a fun listen although the images going along with it were less fun to watch unfortunately the looped dialogue sounds flat was this shot non sync doubtful it looks like video through and through i watched the special introduction by troma films' lloyd kaufman before the main feature although it consisted essentially of kaufman plugging his own stuff and admitting that he hadn't seen the movie while someone mugged in a toxie mask its production and entertainment values were higher than 'dead ' itself quick aside to whoever put the dvd together the countdown on film leader beeps only on the flash frame 2 not on every number plus one more after for that matter the vampire film theatregoers are seen watching early in 'dead ' looked a lot more entertaining than this recommendation to avoid unless you know someone involved in the production or are an ardent lloyd kaufman completist he plays 'kaufman the minion' in the film within a film br br full disclosure my girlfriend is an extra in this movie i swear this did not color my review
<START> the guy did a lot of title design for a bunch of movies and i guess one day he said i should pick a cheap scenario try to put as much title in it as a can cause after all i'm a title designer and try to persuade people that this is in fact a movie one of the worst i've even seen that's for sure if you fell the urge to see nice titles go check out some posters don't waste your time watching this br br it kinda ironic don't you think did you saw the poster the only part of his project that should had title work done have almost none
<START> in its way mister foe originally and more appropriately titled hallam foe Â i can't see addressing its title character as mister is a tribute to good acting both jamie bell as hallam a physically attractive voyeur creep and sophia myles as kate his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance are convincing the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life a young man who spies on the intimate details of people's lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp and a woman in kate's situation would be repulsed and frightened she would probably call the police br br these things are not however what happens in the movie poor hallam's mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he's been having an affair hallam of course hates his stepmother and lets he know it she has sex with him kate's some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games she looks like his birth mother it all ends happily with hallam resolving his issues br br forty some years ago the play and brilliantly acted movie who's afraid of virginia woolf had a similarly optimistic ending with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart the trouble is it doesn't always work that way especially when nobody really cares in virginia woolf the ending's plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation in mister foe the emotional revelation never really happens
<START> i began watching this movie with low expectations as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a s k novel a novel i never read br br i'm glad my expectations were low because the movie wasn't nothing close to good but it manages to keep you interested what really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors the movie is overlong hasn't no nice shots and no scares the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crap br br the only things good are that as i said it keeps you interested i guess the book must be good without using much horror cliches br br my vote 4 10
<START> barbra streisand is a tour de force in this hollywood story her performances and the songs are one of a kind and are special in the halls of great movies the scene where she is introduced to the unexpecting audience by kristopherson against the crowds' wishes and hers only to turn them around with her magnificent performance of woman in the moon is one of the best examples on film of how well a great performer can win over an audience it's real the scene where she records evergreen ranks with the best in the business all live no lip sync very special streisand is often criticized for being a diva but she delivers on this one she is majestic singing with one more look at you she deserved the oscar she and paul williams got for evergreen kristopherson had his moments too far above most of his movie appearances this version of the born franchise ranks with the first one of 1937 janet gaynor frederic march although i will always enjoy judy garland and james mason musical remake of 1954 i haven't seen the dvd yet and don't know about its quality
<START> so this guy named george is sitting home alone on his birthday when two women show up george's wife is at a hospital taking care of their son so when the wife is away george gets in the bubble bath and makes love to both of the girls it isn't that great of a scene because it really doesn't show anything after that the birthday boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still at his house they make him a nice breakfast but george isn't hungry george isn't very happy and he tries to ditch them but when he gets home the girls are still at his house the girls have had enough with old george and no longer want to cook for them they both turn out to be major psychopaths and use george in their little crazy game i liked that the girls just did what they wanted and messed up george's house george wasn't really that great to his two guests when george said he was a married man he really didn't seem to mean it george looked like tom tucker on family guy i was for the two girls the whole time
<START> in die nibelungen siegfried siegfried was betrayed now kriemhild seeks revenge she marries hagen and through a series of events finally engages in a very drastic but fitting action at the end br br one of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portrayals attila the hun called etzel in the movie is shown as the strange person from the east possibly an allusion to the soviet union obviously it was not fritz lang's fault that hitler used the nibelungenlied for german national pride in the third reich but one can see what the fuhrer liked about the story nonetheless this is an absolutely formidable movie
<START> i see people writing about how great this movie was it was horrible the acting was sub par at best it made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of leonardo where the hell did they get the money anyway i wanted to learn more about the titanic why it sank what was running through a lot of people's minds maybe even a little conspiracy stuff does anyone realize that certain people didn't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off no you don't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid br br i did cry in during one scene though the scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship it looked like pool water i'm thinking this movie made all this money and they couldn't even make the water from the ocean look real unbelievable br br ohhh the band played on while the ship sank just ridiculous this was the worst movie until pearl harbor outdid it in the nothing to do with reality department
<START> i was lying on my bed with a really bad cold or flu or whatever i figure maybe i'd kill some time watching some horror movies my mom bought for me a little while ago i wish i never picked this movie after i watched it i felt even more sick and i wanted to throw up afterwords when i got better of course i did some research on dennis l rader and i noticed that the dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one i hope that no one ever watches this movie but if they ever do don't eat or you'll feel the way i felt after i first watched it i think you would have a better time watching the santa claus 3 at least that movie had better reviews on this site
<START> someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudo gritty look is somehow seen as realistic by some people br br i didn't see anything realistic about the characters although the actors did their best with really bad parts or the situations instead i saw a forced self conscious effort at being edgy gritty and down and dirty br br sadly it takes a lot more than hand holding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way br br it's a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies with bad cinematography non existent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as art br br it's little wonder that films like in the bedroom or about schmidt get such raves i found them to be meandering and very average but compared to the current slew of independent clones like raising victor vargas they are outright brilliant and inspired br br a few years ago seeing an independent film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets nowadays it means that chances are you'll get yet another by the numbers let's shake the camera around for two hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors and of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived br br is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies not at all when you see films like raising victor vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them
<START> i am so insulted by this movie it's not even funny and i thought mulan was unbelievable however low my expectations of disney have become i never figured they'd do something so stereotypical yet so off there is no respect here for any true chinese culture just the hollywood tradition of random martial arts br br i appreciate that they tried to make wendy into a normal teenage girl but fortunately most normal teenage girls particularly asian teenage girls are much less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life and from a cultural stand point it's almost impossible yes there are girls who are wrapped up in popularity and fashion but they're pretty rare and even the ones who are are still fairly decent scholars another stereotype maybe but a fairly true one because that's how chinese parents work that's how chinese values work if they wanted to go for authenticity they would've made wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love hate relationship with her family br br this just adds to my frustration with american movies asian culture isn't about meditation and vague nature oriented phrases that sound wise we don't walk around smiling enigmatically all the time and we don't all know some form of martial arts we're a people and i'd appreciate it if someone would write an asian part that doesn't portray us as some sad caricature
