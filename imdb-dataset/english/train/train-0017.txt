<START> by now you should already know about this film the jessica simpson bomb that pretty much went straight to video limited anemic theatrical run basically ms simpson's katie travels from a small town in oklahoma to visit her boyfriend to surprise him only to find him in bed with another woman she is stranded but has one friend rachel leigh cook whom i wish we saw more often in film who lets her stay katie ends up getting a job via two conniving co workers penelope ann miller and the always amusing andy dick who are just using katie to get the president of the firm larry miller ousted this is strictly a b movie its not meant to be profound jessica simpson is not a great actress by any means but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying the film is watchable in that its not an abomination but its throwaway fluff in a cameo penny marshall is funny a subtle in joke about milwaukee made me chuckle and there is a funny scene involving norwegian priests don't read too much into this so not horrible but easy to skip your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does again not good but not a profound disaster
<START> bruce almighty one of carrey's best pictures since well a long time it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes the best scene in it is where jim is messing up the anchor man's voice br br my rating 8 10
<START> everyone in this movie tells raffy carruthers how talented she is what a great director she'll one day turn out to be etc i think they're just being nice even kimble rendall who directed this film shows more talent than she does the next jane campion they call her and even apart from the fact that they're both over rated the two have so much in common they both direct movies they're both women they're both australian well give or take br br yep it's one of those films in which a character is deemed to be brilliant and we just have to swallow hard and accept it but i'll say this for carruthers she's cute and fascinating no really here are some thoughts on her lack of talent br br 1 part of a director's talent lies in dealing with people why is carruthers so phenomenally bad at getting her crew to even take notice of her so as to make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and get killed i expect br br 2 why is this one of the most unconvincing depictions of a movie set i have ever seen after all it must have been filmed on a real movie set how could they get it wrong if rendall's set was half as much of an under staffed shambles it's a wonder he completed his film at all br br 3 carruthers the fictional director has set herself the task of creating a brand new 1980s horror flick fat chance i doubt it can be done these days i suspect that rendall the actual and more talented director set himself the same task realised it couldn't be done and settled for sigh knowing parody instead of course it's not enough of a parody to work as a parody as soon as the cast and crew set foot in the isolated mansion the film just spends most of its time doing badly what 1980s horror films did well less badly br br 4 and yet and yet the film opens with not a parody but an honest to goodness pastiche of 80s horror starring this is too good to be true molly ringwald this pastiche is much better than anything that follows it's a bad sign when you find yourself wishing you were watching the movie within the movie rather than the movie yet it too was filmed in the late 1990s perhaps it is still possible to make 1980s horror you just have to drop the knowing parody stuff and mean it br br 5 i'd never once wondered what 1980s teen horror would be like if all the characters had australian accents but now i know and strangely i'm glad i know a need i never knew i had has been fulfilled
<START> one wonders why this picture was made at all the plot as such is totally unbelievable if not ridiculous the characters experienced loner cop versus younger one quite fascinated quite predictable the ending totally murky and impossible to understand maybe after several viewings but you'd have to have a masochistic tendency for that the idea being you have to read the book to understand fully what it's all about and the acting is bad was the basic idea to show that french film makers are able to do as well as americans in the genre that include seven and silence of the lambs if so it is a total failure it was quite a success though and has a sort of cult status as the first french serial killer film and it seems considered as a good product to export strange
<START> how to lose friends alienate people is not based on tiger woods' infidelities it is a mediocre romantic comedy based on toby young's book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities the film stars simon pegg as sidney young a zany british journalist who takes a job in an illustrious celebrity magazine in new york young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigans to alienate all around him hence movie title he is uproarious daring and moronic but nevertheless for some very bizarre reason he is a somewhat likable character sidney befriends a fellow journalist the composed alison olsen played quite admirably by kirsten dunst however sidney is primarily longing for the sexpot actress sophie maes played by the fantastic ms megan fox this foxtrot is short on acting proficiency but high on eye candy material sidney gets in all kinds of tomfoolery in order to move up the journalist ladder in the magazine co those are the peak comedic moments of the film however i think that director robert weide and screenwriter peter straughan might lose some viewers and alienated authentic rom com material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between sidney alison even though team weidstraughan did formulate an entertaining narrative otherwise pegg did peg his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as sidney young jeff bridges was again building the dude bridges with his enigmatic supporting work as clayton harding the magazine's suave prez but the rest of the film's acting was not worthy enough to feature here how to lose friends alienate people should not be alienated entirely but you might lose some movie friends if you publicize it as a superlative romantic comedy average
<START> as romantic comedies go this was a cute and winning one i thought that the writing could have been stronger to build up the final connection a bit better but that is not a huge tripping point but amanda detmer and scott wolf give nice performances and are as charming as ever these are two of my favorite actors and i was just glad to see them cast as romantic leads i hope to see them cast in more projects soon br br overall this movie won't change your life but is is sweet warm and winning not a bad thing to be at all
<START> i rented this movie on dvd without knowing what to expect and as i am about to study film making in canada of all places i most certainly will bring this up in class br br the story centered around the probably most unlucky film team in the history of film itself is brilliantly written and the very talented actors manage to deliver every single pun on time br br if you simply couldn't laugh during hollywood north i suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away you might have serious issues br br besides the wonderful script i also noticed the great chemistry between actors deborah kara unger and matthew modine where they really just acting jennifer tilly playing a hilariously bad actress and martin landau also delivered a very edgy yet funny performance br br great film even better cast
<START> while the british produced some hilarious and slick sitcoms in the 1990s ab fab men behaving badly one foot in the grave etc the 70s were the real golden age br br in the 1970s there were whole new territories to explore including the sexual revolution feminism and the slowly evolving awareness of a need for sensitivity that would twenty years later become political correctness attempts to grapple with the confusion of this thoroughly modern world were the subtle and not so subtle themes in everything from the skits of monty python's flying circus to sitcoms like man about the house by the late 70s this grappling resulted in more meditative and bitter sweet sitcoms such as the masterpiece butterflies br br man about the house is a perfect example of the good britcoms of the time slightly genteel cheeky fresh ingenuous sometimes outrageous with some well made observations on contemporary life compare it to a cynical 90s show such as ab fab and it is hard to believe the two were created in the same country br br man about the house is one of the great britcoms of the 70s right up there with good neighbors the good life and about the house's spin off george and mildred its quality is attested to by the fact that as with good neighbors its creators writers and many of its cast have had continued success in british television
<START> greetings again from the darkness remember all the what happened to woody allen jokes even mr allen poked fun at the fans who wanted him to continue making his same funny films as with any great artist mr allen's craft evolved over the years and he lost some fans while picking up others last year's masterpiece matchpoint showed he is still every bit as relevant and poignant as he was in the days of annie hall and manhattan what is most striking to us 40 plus year fans is that mr new york himself seems to have a bit of a crush on the mother country apparently he actually likes england while filming matchpoint mr allen became enamored with scarlett johansson and her real life spirit and sense of humor this attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years scarlett while risking overexposure must be given credit for not just picking films that cast her in some glamorous light she is unafraid to look and act like a real person in scoop she flashes some real on screen comedy chops and in many scenes delivers the real punchline to mr allen's straight man of course any time mr allen decides to put himself in front of the camera he will get more than his share of one liners and social commentaries in which is fine because few do it better br br very nice support work from ian mcshane and hugh jackman in fact mr jackman provides a few glimpses into why many of us thought him the best choice to replace brosnan as the new bond as with most of allen's films the star is the script not the actors although scarlett delivers superbly here and is a nice contrast to the polished allen and jackman what makes this one crackle is the dialogue especially the banter between allen and scarlett if you are not a huge woody the actor fan fear not he does limit his screen time and he is quite effective except in two or three brief scenes that almost seem out of place another woodman tradition is a sparkling musical background and scoop is no exception especially the strauss composition br br scoop is a nice cross between annie hall and the best of the marx brothers films or the cary grant comedies yes it is an adult comedy but it is actually very cute especially for a serial killer and talking ghost comedy
<START> i just don't understand why this movie is getting beat up in here jeez it is mindless it isn't polished and it is as i am reading wasted on some the cast of this movie plays their characters to the 't' if you watched permanent midnight and became a ben stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed these are misunderstood well intentioned misfits trying to save the city world with nothing but grit and determination the problem is they don't realize their limits until the big showdown and that's the point this is 3 times the movie that the spy who shagged me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group likely the same people who feel the first ap movie pales in comparison to the sequel i just don't get it the jokes work on more then one level if you didn't get it i know what level you're at
<START> my husband is a huge robin williams fan i like him too but have generally found that he should stick to what he does best and focus on comedic roles my thoughts were confirmed with this movie i was completely bored throughout the entire film the story was predictable i realize it was inspired by a true story but my guess is that there could have been some suspense or intrigue even while maintaining truth in the story none of the characters were well developed there was a side story about the main character and his partner this relationship could have been explored further more important though would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the boy her psychological profile would have been interesting to delve into she obviously has a long history that was not touched upon except in the most superficial way if my husband wasn't such a huge williams fan we would have left 20 minutes into it too bad i can't get my 20 or 2 hours back
<START> i saw this little magnum opus for the first time very recently on one of those dollar dvd's that seem to be everywhere nowadays and was so moved by it that i cannot contain myself for those who have never seen this mesmerizingly miserable mexican import and wish to view it without being prejudiced by anyone else's jaundiced commentary there are undoubtedly substantial spoilers in what follows so if you are one of those reckless individuals stop reading at once and go and watch it for yourself if you get drunk enough in advance you might be fortunate enough to pass out before it's over br br begin with the premise that a man may become a werewolf after being bitten by a yeti no one in the film ventures an explanation as to how this sort of cross species implantation could occur and the rest of the movie is even more hopelessly nonsensical but pour yourself another glass of wine or whatever you're drinking and let us proceed br br paul naschy our werewolf has the look of a man fighting a toothache in a town where the only dentist has traded his supply of novocaine for a case of cheap whiskey and has been drunk ever since ain't he the lucky one naschy's facial expression never varies whether in or out of makeup and apparently no one gave him any coaching on how to act like a werewolf occasionally he tries to imitate the lon chaney jr crouch but most of the time he simply strolls around in his black mafia shirt like just another cool dude with a tad too much facial hair to be fair the makeup is actually better than the actor inside of it but the continuity is infinitely worse naschy's werewolf is the only one i can think of that changes shirts twice in the middle of a prowl he goes from black shirt to red shirt then back to black then back to red then back to black all in a single frenzied night interestingly enough he always does the chaney crouch while wearing the red shirt and the cool dude walk while wearing the black shirt and it's only while he is wearing the red shirt that we see much of the fury alluded to in the title presumably there's something about that red shirt that just brings out the animal in him br br so anyway after being bitten by the cross pollinating yeti the poor schmuck returns home from tibet to learn that his wife has been sleeping with one of his students the two illicit lovers try to murder him by adjusting the brakes on his car he survives the wreck and makes it home just in time for a full moon then after chewing up his wife and her lover he wanders off again and somehow manages to get himself electrocuted but is that enough can they let this tormented wretch rest in peace not a chance he is resurrected by a supposed female scientist with a hardcore s m fetish otherwise known as the doctor and definitely not a new incarnation of doctor who she digs him up and whisks him away to her kinky kastle takes him down to the dungeon chains him to the wall and gives him a damn good flogging presumably such a string of indignities ought to be enough to put a little fury into any wolfman br br after his two shirted rampage our wolfman spends most of the rest of the film wandering around the castle trying to find a way out and who can blame him in the course of his wanderings he encounters a bewilderingly incoherent assortment of clichÃ©s including a man dressed in medieval armor a curiously inept phantom of the opera impersonator supposedly the doctor's father and a hard partying cadre of bondage slaves br br so what's it all about one may reasonably ask one gets the vague impression that it has something to do with mind control and involves something the doctor calls chemotrodes best guess i really have no idea how it's spelled if there even is such a thing mercifully the experiment ends in failure and most importantly it ends before one has time to gnaw one's own leg off br br of course one doesn't really expect any sense from a film like this but at least it ought to be good for laughs this one isn't forget it buddy there is a creeping sort of anarchy about this film from its patched together tequila drenched ambiance to its atrocious cinematography and agonizing musical score that defies even the most sozzled attempts to get any mst3k type laughs out of it if it's not even good for that what the hell is it good for if montezuma's revenge could have somehow been digitally remastered and put on a dvd it would have looked exactly like this movie
<START> pointless humourless drivel meant to be a comedy but not one laugh in the whole film gratuitous violence often with guns what kind of warped mentality can either make or say this is a good film 1 out of 10
<START> this movie is a lot like the movie hostel except with bad acting and not much suspense the gore elements are there but you don't really feel anything for the characters making the violence not very effective some parts are just strange like forcing a snake down someones throat what's up with that is that supposed to be scary or gory it's just kind of stupid as for torture there really isn't any except for the guy getting blow torched in the beginning which they don't show anyway the main bad guy keeps saying make them die slowly yet the butcher kills them all very fast the deaths are all relatively quick yes i did watch the unrated version so overall not the worst gore movie i've seen but not at all good either you won't miss anything if you skip this one
<START> yet again one of the most misunderstood goddesses of my country has been twisted by westerners who cannot understand the esoteric symbolism of the mother goddess in her dark forms the mother takes on the frightening form of kali mata to destroy our inner demons and to terrify our egos and though blood sacrifice is given to kali and durga the events depicted in this film are just absurd the mother takes on a wrathful form to be wrathful to our inner demons limitations and ego when no other form will suffice it's also in her wrathful form that she burns away all your karmas in the smashan fires that you cultivate in your heart for her to dance on if you love her and she will bring you to reality and truth reality and truth has a dark side as well as light which serves a purpose the mother is the embodiment of the physical universe as well she is nature nature can be cruel and destructive to maintain balance you cannot have growth and life without death and destruction kali represents the force of destruction for the purpose of new growth and life both mundane and spiritual in the universe it's very outrageous to me that people who know nothing of india or it's divinity can just take one of our beloved goddesses and use her like a cheap prostitute to make some low budget talentless horror film how dare they take our beloved mother and portray her as a horror that makes people chop their eyelids off she is only horrific to those who are attached to their ego and who live in delusion greed anger and other inner demons it's very clear to me that the person who wrote this movie must have a very serious self deluding ego and serious inner demons to see kali as so horrible and terrible when the ego drops away she becomes a form that is enchanting beautiful and young a beauty that is so enchanting to behold that she enchants the entire universe with it kali maa is an ancient mother not to be trifled with for the sake of entertainment let's just hope that in her endless compassion and mercy that she does not take on wrathful form to those involved with this movie br br the audacity that westerners have in using religions like my own or the religions of the caribbean islands such as santeria and vodou which are actually very positive and other such religions to twist and exaggerate misunderstood elements that the western mind cannot comprehend is totally ridiculous it's clear that there is no respect for what people live breathe and believe in when it comes to these kind of flicks br br kali maa in reality is a caring and compassionate mother whom we shed tears at her beautiful feet in devotion and love for and i am happy that my mother takes on wrathful form sometimes to protect her devotees from themselves and from outside forces br br many praises to the real kali maa who has shown many the path of god and realization
<START> i was expecting a little something from k 911 i mean it did look like a cute movie that i could get into i always did love the dog comedy movies but it looked like it was supposed to be jame's movie not jerry lee's the plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn't have chemistry to begin with not to mention that james seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction james just really ticked me off for more than half the film the dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out shined the actors br br so i'm glad it's not just me on imdb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie but hopefully james will realize it was his brother jim who was the talented one no offense but not everyone can be their star sibling don't you wish ashlee simpson would take that same advice d br br 3 10
<START> based on the personal experiences of director john singleton's time at the university of southern california comes higher learning a film centered on the racial politics that occur at modern day colleges br br there are three main characters to which the film bases its foundation around for its story malik williams an carefree lowbrow athlete who is an african american male kristin conner a sheltered soft white girl and remy a unsophisticated unconnected white male all three are overcome by the sudden realities that college life is not as good as it is advertised as all three go through disappointment by being unprepared malik by being naive kristin and by being unwanted remy br br one good thing about the film is that it does show that modern american colleges are just high schools writ large the colleges are not places to build character develop potential or enhance personal advancement but they are institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a one size fits all atmosphere it is an experience that usually is built for failure for most students it would have been good if the film built it story about this travesty rather than racial politics br br but it didn't and that's where the films falls apart singleton it seems had a pretty bad experience at southern california through this film he lets it all hang out there is no need to beat around the bush here singleton lets the heroes and the villains of this piece be easily seen br br the black characters in the film are pretty much seen as the heroes here while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains save for kristin who was raped by a fellow white student br br who can understand the inconsistencies of this film black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points out to them who supposedly raped her the ease that the black gang members have at the university while a bunch of skin heads meet in a dark small dorm planning violence br br the performances of omar epps malik and kristy swanson kristin are disappointing they do seem like the third choices for the roles that they played in this movie tupac shakur and drew barrymore were supposed to play malik and kristin but were unavailable o'shea jackson aka ice cube busta rhymes and regina king were all irritating in their respective roles and laurence fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history professor only michael rappaport did well in this film and he did considering that his character of the three main characters changed the most in the film br br john singleton wanted to take on the matter of race and inequality in american college life with this film and he did so quite badly it was sort like killing a fly with a shotgun life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over and he should know this higher learning is proof that he did not understand this at all seeing the film then and now would only confuse disappoint and enrage the same public he would wish to speak to not to mention it would not entertain them in the slightest
<START> the plot a crime lord is uniting 3 different mafias in an entreprise to buy an island that would then serve as money laundering facility for organized crime to thwart that the fbi tries to bust one of the mafia lords the thing goes wrong and by some unlikely plot twists and turns we are presented with another cop buddies who don't like each other movie one being a female fbi agent and the other a male ex dea agent br br so far so stupid but the strength of this movie does not lie in its story a poor joke at best it is funny at least the synchronized german version is the action is good too with a memorable scene involving a shot gun and a rocket launcher but the focus is squarely on the humour not intelligent satire not quite slapstick but somewhere in between you get a lot of funny jokes br br however this film is the opposite of political correctness legal drug abuse is featured prominently without criticism and even displaying it as cool that's the bit of the movie that seriously annoyed me and renders it unsuitable for kids in my opinion br br all in all for a nice evening watching come acceptable action with some funny jokes this movie is perfect just remember in this genre it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema tv room then you'll have a good time 8 10
<START> when a stiff turns up with pneumonic plague a variant of bubonic plague u s public health service official dr clinton reed richard widmark immediately quarantines everyone whom he knows was near the body unfortunately the stiff got that way by being murdered and there's a good chance that the murderer will start spreading the plague leading to an epidemic enter police captain tom warren paul douglas who is enlisted to track down the murderer as soon as possible and avert a possible national disaster br br while panic in the streets is a quality film it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling my reason for bringing the score down to an eight it wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster police procedural thriller and even romance br br this is not director elia kazan's best work but saying that is a bit disingenuous kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as a streetcar named desire 1951 on the waterfront 1954 and east of eden 1955 after all this film predates those but kazan has said that he was already untethered by the studio taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl the film is set in new orleans a city where kazan used to wander around night and day so i knew it well he wanted to exploit the environment it's so terrific and colorful i wanted boats steam engines warehouses jazz joints all of new orleans br br kazan handles each genre of panic in the streets well but they could be connected better the film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods the sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that panic in the streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers edna and edward anhalt quarantine and some like 'em cold br br the gangster material which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film is probably the highlight not surprisingly kazan has said that he believes the villains are more colorful i never had much affection for the good guys anyway i don't like puritans a close second is the only material that approaches the panic of the title the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed inoculate them and contain the disease while there is plenty of suspense during these two moods much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama with pacing more typical of that genre br br the dialogue throughout is excellent the stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced it is intelligent delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character conflict isn't created by dumb decisions but smart moves events and characters' actions are more like a chess game when unusual stances are taken such as reed withholding the plague from the newspapers he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions which other characters argue over br br in light of this it's interesting that kazan believed that propriety religion ethics and the middle class are all murdering us that idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm or allowances away from it made by the protagonists for example head gangster blackie jack palance in his first film role is offered a get out of jail free card if he'll cooperate with combating the plague br br the technical aspects of the film are fine if nothing exceptional but the real reasons to watch are the performances the intriguing scenario and the well written dialogue
<START> i never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie i gotta come really hard on it talking about vivah this guy sooraj badjatya seems to have completely lost it after success of hum aapke hain kaun he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos vivah is so so cheesy that badjatyas have left johars and chopras behind br br there was not a single moment during the movie where i can say 'oh at least this thing is good' aloknath does clichÃ© in a role of girl's father shahid kapoor looks fat and shahrukhed amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets bad costumes hackneyed storyline monstrous stepmother trying hard to act actors cacophonous background music cheap soundtracks br br now the spoiler i'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note
