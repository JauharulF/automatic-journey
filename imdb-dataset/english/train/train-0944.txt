<START> movie comedies nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor foul language and groin kicking modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator the undemanding and slow of brain sure an occasional good comedy will come along but they're becoming rarer all the time br br mr blandings buildings his dream house shows what 1940s hollywood was capable of and it's just screamingly funny jim and muriel blandings cary grant and myrna loy decide to build a house in the connecticut suburbs the film follows their story beginning with house hunting trips the house's riotous construction all the way to the finished home with its zuzz zuzz water softener br br grant and loy are perfect for their roles of course grant is particularly funny as he watches the house's costs zoom out of control however the film is stolen by the blandings' wise attorney played to perfection by melvyn douglas managing to steal every scene he's in douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the blandings lurch from crisis to crisis reginald denny as the blandings' harried architect and harry shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful br br i've watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh i think it's a good film to watch when you need a lift whether you're building a house or not
<START> different film directors from different countries have contributed to the film medium a lot by their thoughts as a result we have experienced different genres when the medium is concerned jafar panahi unlike j l godard or f truffault believes in simple story telling schematic narratives is one of the main traits of his directorial job he has trust upon the automatic as well as critical intelligence of the viewer he does not feel any necessity to go for alienation or such things to reach to the viewers he is equally effective despite being conventional offside 2006 is another schematic creation from him where gender subordination of middle east asia gets gradually clear to everybody as the simple but catchy tale of the movie progresses now a days when all of us are shouting on the issue of rights of women this movie very calmly creeps into our mind and ultimately becomes a hump for our critical intelligence by conveying the message that the egality of human rights is nothing but an illusive good an utopia paternity will never let the women to be empowered an important soccer match where the nation is participating a teenage girl who understands the game well loves her nation does not have the rights to enter into the stadium to cheer for her country she is merely permitted to listen to the live commentary her alias could not work for her as a result she had to undergo several humiliating situations from the very beginning her worried father ran here and there for her daughter at the end of the day celebration came as the nation won the match which the girl could not see as she was detained in the outer side of the stadium during the match time but the celebration cannot suppress the question of rights of women which remain in every corner of the world in different format jafar panahi has most successfully pointed to this issue of gender abuse from with in the frame of conventional film making and patriarchy as well a global tragedy has been dealt with ease and some times with humour which in turn teases our being constantly
<START> this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen br br i can honestly say i have never seen a movie worse than this one br br and i mean never br br i'm a big fan of b horror movies as you may imagine i've been exposed to some of worst that the movie industry has to offer br br i was lured to this movie by it's title i mean c'mon what true fan of horror wouldn't be intrigued by a title like vampires vs zombies images of the undead battling each other to the undeath danced in my head i thought to myself this i've got to see br br well sorry to say this i wish i hadn't seen br br this movies title is very misleading to say the least there was no vampires fighting zombies in fact there is no plot if you were to ask me what this movie is all about i could honestly tell you i have no idea br br there was no plot br br there was no story br br this movie absolutely makes no sense at all br br at the end of this debacle i found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money into this project for they surely have no business sense
<START> watching smother was perhaps the longest not quite 90 minutes of my life there wasn't a laugh to be had in fact i don't remember ever cracking a smile diane keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle aged chain smoking dog hoarder the textbook overbearing mother character a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffers from some kind of personality disorder she is manipulative conniving melodramatic childish narcissistic and worst of all boring br br i suppose i should briefly mention the other characters but why bother it was just a long string of movie clichÃ©s the dippy socially inept distant relative who's just trying to break into the industry the gruff and long suffering but somehow still lovable father the mild mannered wife who just can't take it anymore but eventually moves beyond the discord and resignedly comes home the herd of unhousebroken dogs who like to chew throw pillows while everyone is away etc br br god what a snore i've never been a diane keaton fan and smother only reminded me why overacting is overacting no matter how many pictures you did in your prime her attempts at physical comedy were especially humiliating what was the director thinking br br while i like dax shepard and can even sometimes tolerate liv tyler their performances were so lackluster and dull that it was clear that neither actor gave a damn about this movie that was okay because neither did i keaton's endless self absorbed prattling was intolerable and at times shepard's dislike for her seemed genuine by the end of the movie i wanted to slap her myself br br awful
<START> not only is this movie a great film for basic cinematography screenplay acting setting etc but also for it's realism this movie could take place in any farm or rural setting it makes no difference if the movie takes place in louisiana or if it would take place in kansas the story and the messages it includes would remain the same this movie shows family values and connections for an older audience while at the same time it shows youthful behavior for the younger viewers everyone who watches this will walk away with something having touched them personally i know i did the ending hits way too close to home for me not to burst into tears every time i watch it the ending stresses the importance of farm safety and everyone who has ever worked on a farm needs to see this film not paying attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situations br br
<START> first ever viewing july 21 2008 br br very impressive screenplay and comedic acting and timing in this film now 40 years old it has lost none of it's power neil simon displays excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedy from unusual situations jack lemmon and walter matthau give great comedic performances neil simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the play this film is based on br br one of the best written and acted hollywood comedies of all time br br surprisingly only nominated for 2 academy awards best adapted screenplay and best film editing hollywood rarely awards comedies no matter how well they are made
<START> ok so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary genie comes out of ghetto boom box gives this kid with shaggy hair 3 wishes the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what shaq sucks at rapping and i guess thats it br br so mainly i laughed i cried but mainly i laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba player rapper and boy with shaggy hair br br i highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh br br i'm going to give it a 3 out of 10 only b c the movie is based off of 3 magical wishes br br if i had 3 wishes one would be to erase this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like hollywood didn't waste money on making this
<START> i literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie granted it's shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not but this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not that may prevent many from just not caring about a shakespeare based story br br the largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters often during character's interacting it's nearly difficult to distinguish who's lines are who's granted i believe this movie is dubbed in english certainly they could've obtained voice actors which could've added a bit more drama to these classic literary lines br br it would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1 although perhaps that's based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget still it's absolutely painful and boring if you insist on hamlet do yourself a favor and read the book again 1 10
<START> i went to this movie expecting an artsy scary film what i got was scare after scare it's a horror film at it's core it's not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore this film doesn't even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters i think one of the best things about the concept where it's not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house they become haunted no matter where they are office buildings police stations hotel rooms etc after reading some of the external reviews i am really surprised that critics didn't like this film i am going to see it again this week and am excited about it br br i gave this film 10 stars because it did what a horror film should it scared the s t out of me
<START> wwe has produced some of the worst pay per views in its history over the past few months cyber sunday survivor series and december to dismember were appalling to say the least and so it was relying on its b brand show smackdown to attempt to end the year on a high note armageddon had two major gimmick matches in the last ride and inferno matches three championships were on the line and an interesting main event in the shape of a tag team war featuring batista and john cena against king booker and finlay however it was an amendment to one of those championship matches that brought us not only the match of the night but also now a match of the year candidate when teddy long gave us fans an early christmas present t lo changed the wwe tag team championship match from champions london and kendrick against to regal and taylor to a four team ladder match including mnm and the hardy boyz br br i am not going to dwell on this match too much as nothing i can say would be able to do it justice this has to be seen to be believed there were many high spots and many more brutal bumps and awkward landings the one move i have to talk about however was the one that took joey mercury straight to the emergency room midway through the contest jeff hardy jumped onto a ladder that was set up in the see saw position with matt hardy holding both members of mnm over the opposite end of it to take the full force unfortunately for mercury he didn't get his hands up to protect his face and took the ladder full force in the nose and left eye this was vicious his face was instantly a mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended mercury's night early we found out later he suffered a broken nose and cuts under his left eye be warned this is not for the faint of heart the ending to this roller coaster of a match came after paul london managed to grab both championship belts for the victory i have been watching wrestling for almost 15 years and it doesn't get any better than this match unbelievable br br the night opened with only the 4th ever inferno match kane took on mvp in a good match but it was all about the visual and not really about the action there were a few close calls with the flames for both competitors but in the end it was kane who forced mvp onto the flames after they both ended up outside the ring mvp ran around the ring whilst his butt was on fire and there was a sick part of me that laughed watching this may i suggest to michael hayes that mvp comes out next week on smackdown to johnny cash's ring of fire br br the other gimmick match of the night and the second match of a triple main event was an all out war last ride match between mr kennedy and the undertaker this was a stiff match from start to finish and was the best of the series undertaker and kennedy have had yet the used poles chairs and one scene had the undertaker thrown 15 feet from the armageddon set onto what was suppose to be the concrete floor unfortunately it was plain to see that this was nothing but a crash mat and crowd didn't pop for this the ending came after a chokeslam by the dead man to kennedy on top of the hearse followed quickly by a match winning tombstone br br in other notable happening from the card chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero by submission in another stiff match this was a very good bout with benoit hitting 8 german suplexes on chavo at one time benoit was also considering whether to put vikki guerrero in the sharpshooter or not luckily he came to his senses and let her go this led to chavo attempting the roll up only for it to be countered into the sharpshooter for the submission br br another cracking match on the card was the cruiserweight championship contest between the longest reigning champion in wwe gregory helms and jimmy wang yang featuring a lot of high flying and dangerous spots some of which took place outside the ring this was a match much more deserving of the crowd response than what it got jbl put it best when he berated the fans in richmond virginia for sitting on their hands during this one and at one point even started a boring chant helms picked up the duke after a jawbreaker type manoeuvre with his knees to smackdowns resident redneck br br the boogeyman pinned the miz in a worthless match i hate the boogeyman with a passion only worth listening too for jbl's ranting about miz jbl is comedy gold br br the last match of the night was main event number 3 world heavyweight champion batista and wwe champion john cena teamed up to take on finlay and the champion of champions king booker there was no way the match could top the tag team championship match from earlier on but it entertained none the less the match would have been more memorable had it been given an extra five to ten minutes but how many times have i said that about wwe matches this year already it was king booker who was pinned at the end of the match after a big batistabomb br br so 2006 is over for the wwe in regards to it's pay per view schedule it started the year on a terrible note with new year's revolution but ended on a high one with armageddon this ladder match will long be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time my hat is off to all eight competitors who but their bodies on the line to give the fans one hell of a match
<START> it's remarkable and quite praiseworthy how writers and directors continue to make great movies out of one of the oldest and most over used story lines in cinema dog bite dog is basically not much more than just the simple story of an lone copper obsessively chasing a brilliant criminal only pou soi cheang distinguishes his film from the rest by being extremely violent relentless this is unquestionably one of the grittiest and most uncompromising movies i've ever seen with an atmosphere of constant nihilism and characters that seem to come walking straight out of hell not even the installments in chan wook park's trilogy of vengeance with the exception of oldboy perhaps or any other infamous cat iii film ever released were as sadistic and brutal as some of the events depicted in dog bite dog pang is a young and ruthless cambodian assassin who lands in the crowded streets of hong kong to eliminate the wife of an eminent judge in a restaurant when the police arrives at the place young officer wai sees how pang hastily flees from the scene of the crime and follow him the first actual confrontation between the two rabid dogs results in a gigantic blood bath as pang mercilessly kills several hostages and even wai's long time friend and colleague from then on begins a thrilling and action packed cat and mouse game between the frustrated cop and the professional killer the latter also saves a young girl from the constant sexual abuse of her father and stays with her at her shed in the local garbage dump what makes this routine action thriller so fascinating apart from the explicit violence are the main characters' backgrounds pang the hit man is a cambodian orphan and has been trained to fight kill for money ever since he was a child he knows no restrictions has no mercy and barely speaks a word wai the cop became particularly ruthless and unorthodox ever since his role model father also a cop lies in a coma after a drug related incident lai doesn't question suspects and witnesses he yells at them and he's prepared to sacrifice everything in order to stop his brand new nemesis people with a weak stomach or tangled nerves are advised to stay away from this film because the cruelty and shocks featuring in dog bite dog can easily cause nausea it's not the type of violence where bloodied heads and chopped off limbs fly through the air but more like the intense and utterly disturbing type where people attempt to crush their opponents mentally as well as physically the filming locations are effectively dark and eerie and the extremely sober music makes the already harrowing tone of the movie even more petrifying the performances are terrific i wouldn't be surprised if edison chen and sam lee treated each other like enemies on the film set as well because their on screen hatred and disgust feels a little too legitimate dog bite dog is a powerful and unforgettable film highly recommended if you can stomach it if you fear you can't just wait a few years for the inevitable american remake which will unquestionably soften the premise a little
<START> as a pokÃ©mon fan i enjoyed this movie very much it introduces new legendary pokÃ©mon as each movie does and adds depth to the relationships between its characters i however do not expect those who are not pokÃ©mon fans to enjoy it this includes most adults some of the lines were corny but that can be somewhat unavoidable when dubbing the movie over to english the animation was beautiful although there were a couple parts that did not look good and although the villain is kind of corny i think that the movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains and i guarantee you that they aren't all like this one those who did not like it i say to each his own but pokÃ©mon fans will love it
<START> because 99 out of 100 times the producers lied through their teeth or someone else's to get you to rent or buy their mercifully censored br br shock o rama cinema proves the truth of this yet one more time with the release of feeding the masses a possibly well intentioned but utterly inept and dismal entry into the zombie genre folks this is not only low budget film making this is very low budget film making by a bunch of people who i'm sorry i know they have families who love them will never ever be in variety in any significant fashion this is one baaaaaaaaaad mooin' pitcher folks and not just because it's cheap br br the acting is mediocre but i don't blame the actors they had no direction they had no direction because the script was a half baked zombie fantasy with no sense of real cinematic storytelling characterization is thin at best no thanks to weak dialogue and soporific direction have i mentioned yet that the script and the direction are pretty lame they are there's no drama no tension no great character moments nothing the whole premise of government suppression of the media is squandered on sophomoric commercial breaks and an undramatic storyline that defies rational analysis and awkwardly shambles to its ridiculous finish syd fields would not be pleased br br how could the government suppress the truth of a virulent zombie epidemic when the reality of it would be apparent everywhere why would they give it more than a cursory try in this day and age of cellphone cameras with wireless access what could they possibly hope to accomplish for more than a day or so at best now if they were covering something up like their own culpability but feeding the masses never explores such possibilities instead it dwells on absurdity and poorly staged events to dig for laughs and or significance praying its audience won't notice the near total lack of production value beyond basic film making equipment did anyone in this film get paid i hope the actors did if only for their time wasted on career blind alleys like this one at least the techies got to rack up some legitimate work experience br br even zombie fans will find little to gain from feeding the masses the gore is remarkably tame for no budgeters of its rank and there are no distinctive set pieces or memorable effects they're all eminently forgettable in fact knb has nothing to fear br br even junk like the aussie stillbirth undead was miles ahead of feeding the masses sorry guys back to the drawing boards and take your deceptive marketing with you
<START> i am not a usual commenter on this website but seeing how underrated this movie is i endeavour myself to write some comments and remarks about it i had fun watching this movie perhaps because cat is everything i wish i could be i am not going to post spoilers or reveal plots but there's are things that i really found amazing the way she manipulates people it's just so divine this is a very underrated movie i lack of arguments here i usually go enjoy and then speak little about it when you go to the movies is to have fun and i really enjoyed the 1h53 i stayed in the dark room a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away let's try not be so critical about it thank you for reading
<START> robert de niro cuba gooding jr hal holbrook and all the rest of the actors and actresses in men of honour have combined to make this a fine movie mark isham wrote the filmscore so you know the music is truly fine too br br but after noticing a slew of goofs loopholes and over dramatic heart string pluckings right from the start i had to make a vow to ignore them and sit back to enjoy the film if you can do that it really is good br br the story of carl brashear a true to life hero is inspirational enough to last a lifetime look him up on the internet the entire story is more amazing than the film as the director admitted in his comments there were only three african american u s navy divers in world war ii however none reached the status of u s navy master diver carl brashear was the first african american u s navy master diver and he was the first amputee diver to ever be certified or recertified as a u s navy diver resounding applause br br on the negative side of the movie's ledger should i tell you of only one of the many loopholes yeah i'll mark this comment as containing spoilers and do so the early pivotal scene where the helicopter hits the radio mast and sinks into the sea they'd never have had the time to suit up a full mark v diver even if he were the legendary master chief billy sunday in time to be only a couple of minutes late saving the pilot br br so for loopholes goofs and over dramatization i derated men of honor from a perfect 10 down to a 7 br br will hollywood ever realize that the unalloyed truth is so much better that their over dramatic approach to story telling i doubt it too bad
<START> four words account for why this film was made she done him wrong the huge commercial success of that mae west vehicle convinced the studio brass that gay '90s melodramas were a viable proposition here we are rewarded with a fast moving well written romp which neatly targets the personalities of its stars br br wallace beery and george raft are excellent as friendly rivals jackie cooper is a little harder to take but it is fay wray who steals the film with her stock in trade damsel in distress with a strong director as walsh proves himself to be wray could carry a lot of punch and she is utterly believable as the object of both raft and beery's affection br br lots of atmosphere beautifully designed this is a forgotten film worthy of revival
<START> why take a show that millions of us watched and loved as children and make a complete joke of it they ask why hollywood isn't making the money it used to because they put out garbage and pay actors huge amounts of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay 10 to see their garbage the tv show was what it was good people in bad situations where the good il' boys come out on top it wasn't gone with the wind but it was fun this movie is garbage hollywood can't come up with anything original so they take something that was good and ruin it for some i only hope that this movie makes 10x's less than it cost to make the only one's to have any fun with this crap are the guys who got to drive the general lee the audience is the victim br br don't see it watch the reruns of the tv show instead they still hold up 20 years later
<START> words really can't describe how bad this film is i thought zandalee was bad but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off this is just laughable terrible script poor direction awful acting and you know what i can't think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn't too long if you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work far more enjoyable and much better value for money assuming that you need it incidentally i need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review please do not buy this movie it is terrible
<START> i caught this on the dish last night i liked the movie i traveled to russia 3 different times adopting our 2 kids i can't put my finger on exactly why i liked this movie other than seeing bad turn good and good turn semi bad i liked the look ben chaplin has through the whole movie like i can't belive this is happening to me whether it's good or bad it the same look and it works great ending 7 10 rent it or catch it on the dish like i did
<START> i had not seen the movie trailer when i went to see the movie instead i based my judgments on a friend's opinions now i like chris rock and his comedy but this movie just falls flat on its face br br during the movie rock delivers a couple of funny jokes but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy the movie seems want to integrate both laughter and love into one and it that endeavor it fails the love story in the movie is straight forward luckily but it detracts too much from the movie by making rock serious and bland after all the movie is first and foremost destined to be a comedy where laughter should be the primary concern not much of that in the movie br br the plot is also pretty uninteresting as a whole some parts were discontinuous altogether if the supporting cast were meant to be funny they certainly didn't do a good job the couple of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes which were dry and dull rock's first incarnation's couple of underlings were also bland if there's one thing they did do right though they made rock seem funnier by comparison
