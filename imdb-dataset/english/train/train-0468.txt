<START> this made for television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective more realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events though the one movie made after this went perhaps too far in humanizing the figures of sam houston bowie travis and crockett br br the focus here is on jim bowie played with sharp cynical detachment by james arness who is apparently still alive at age 85 then 65 he made a comeback to acting after years away from the screen to do this part br br puerto rican born raul julia humanizes gen santa ana as no one since j carol naish back in '54 had done however the mexican dictator is portrayed as a lecherous vainglorious popinjay gaudier uniforms have never been seen before or since he receives excellent advice from the european officers he has hired but convinced of his own infallibility he does not heed it br br alec baldwin is the one actor whose age is appropriate to the character he plays col william travis his portrayal is earnest he is almost in awe of the older men who share command with him br br the one jarring note was brian keith as crockett in a coonskin cap and carrying ol' betsy he stumbles about as if he had wandered in from another movie with no conviction in the portrayal the character is reduced to a few stage conventions br br the script reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in earlier film versions we learn that jim bowie was in the person of santa ana fighting his own brother in law the mexican soldiers performed poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left over from the napoleonic wars a generation earlier santa ana likes a bargain bowie wryly explains the whole project of defending the former spanish mission as a fort was militarily ill advised a fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film the alamo
<START> before i start i should point out that i know the editor of this film we've never met but we belong to the same fanzine those things which came before message boards and we have talked on the phone so i do have a bias here anyway br br somehow it's ironic how while the rat pack culture of the late 50's and early to mid 60's made a comeback in the mid 90's this movie from the son of one of the original rat pack and which was made in a similar fashion was a flop not only that it was a critical flop i believe peter travers of rolling stone was the only one who did not savage this he gave it a mixed review as i recall and while i don't think this is the greatest film in the world and i am not a fan of the rat pack or cocktail culture i do think this is worth seeing br br for one thing this looks stylish and moves right along for another the core performances are all good richard dreyfus is surprisingly restrained here as the head gangster coming back from a sanitarium and has a droll edge to him jeff goldblum goes back to the quietly ironic performances he gave in his pre blockbuster days like the big chill and while ellen barkin is only required to vamp in this movie she does it entertainingly admittedly it's not a great film the dialogue is mostly made up of puns and a lot of them don't work like the whole zen of ben speech and gabriel byrne and kyle maclachlan are awful here still i was entertained and if you like gangster films you might be too
<START> amateurish in the extreme camera work especially overwrought documentary camera operators needn't spin around all the time br br the script is truly inane and the acting is even worse on top of that the story is disjointed and meandering with some gaping holes in logic at one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with suspected al quada operatives and thus get an interview with osama i found the story entirely unbelievable as a result of so many flaws the filmmaker lead role really portrays a rash idiot frat boy the only item of interest really is that the filmmakers did in fact film on location it's truly a shame they wasted their opportunity to make something interesting br br who financed this crap
<START> this had a good story it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool br br i've watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i've seen in the two weeks br br jason bigg's character was the best though br br even though it was small it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning br br this may be a romantic comedy and i don't like most but the writing direction performing sound design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool br br this film scored pretty high out of all the movie's i've seen lately and the rest were big budget or better publicized br br good job in writing
<START> this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong's 'new wave' that began with tsui hark's zu warriors of magic mountain tsui set a tone for the new wave's approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave jackie chan sammo hung wong jing ching siu tung etc accepted from then on as a given namely the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony if not outright comedy burning paradise put a stop to all that and with a vengeance br br it's not that there isn't humor here but it is a purely human humor as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw but this is just as humans are not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time br br when irony is at last introduced into the film it is the nastiest possible emanating from the 'abbot' of red lotus temple who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before he is the very incarnation of milton's satan from paradise lost better to rule in hell than serve in heaven and if he can't get to satan's hell soon enough he'll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule br br that's the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here it's not that the abbot just wants to kill people he wants them to despair to feel utterly hopeless to accept his nihilism as all encompassing reality thus there's a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself it has become all there is to the universe and the abbot claiming mastery of infinite power is in charge br br of course fortunately the film doesn't end there though there are losses the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails if you want to know how see the film yet there is no doubt that in viewing this film we visit hell hopefully we do not witness our own afterlives but we certainly feel chastened by the experience and somehow better for it over all
<START> wimpy stuffed shirt armand louque blandly played by veteran character actor dean jagger in a rare lead role joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies armand falls for the lovely claire duval fetching blonde dorothy stone who uses the meek sap to get armand's colleague clifford grayson the hopelessly wooden robert noland to marry her furious over being used and spurned by claire armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge sound exciting well it sure ain't for starters victor halperin's static non direction lets the meandering and uneventful talk ridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace worse yet halperin crucially fails to bring any tension atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings the mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast doesn't help matters any only george cleveland as the hearty general duval and e alyn warren as the irascible dr trevissant manage to enliven things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics the drippy stock film library score the painfully obvious stagebound sets and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well in fact this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited starkly staring eyes of the great bela lugosi can alleviate the brain numbing boredom a dismally dull dud
<START> another in the they don't make em like that category this story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean sometimes over the top fun robert stack and dorothy malone are at their peak as the troubled hadley siblings and they really took the roles and ran with them malone won an oscar and stack was nominated in the supporting categories both honors being eminently well deserved they counterbalance the somewhat bland leads neither bacall nor hudson could ever be called bad actors but they've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here it's kind of hard for me to accept rock hudson playing such a red blooded heterosexual as he does here but that's more of a personal bias than anything else but that doesn't take away from the movie's overall entertainment value which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable if you're up some night and this movie comes on i'd say watch it it's well worth it
<START> the first one was different and funny this attempt should have never left the studio this movie does not make you laugh it is a weak attempt at gross out humor the movie picks out current and old movies to rip off this time the jokes seem used and overdone the audience that i saw it with only re acted to hannibal dinner scene and was otherwise asleep
<START> the only thing i remember about this movie are two things first as a twelve year old even i thought it stunk second it was so bad that when mad magazine did a parody of it they quit after the first page and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed it br br if you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period try animal house it's so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art another good selection would be caddyshack the classic with the late rodney dangerfield and bill murray before he became annoyingly charming with great lines like greens keeper carl spackler's correct me if i'm wrong sandy but if i kill all the golfers they'll lock me up and throw away the key
<START> out of br br yep dressed to kill is that kind of a movie it's like kalifornia but it's different remember that movie from 1993 which stars brad pitt as a serial killer who is welcomed by a couple of travelers in a trip to california as a buddy who might be a good company along the way when i watch a movie i always like not to know anything at all about the plot before watching it because the surprises may get even cooler that's how it was with kalifornia when i watched it last year for the first time i never realized it was a suspense movie so when i found out i was shocked and when the movie went on and on it got even better and i was at the edge of my seat almost kissing my monitor so close i was to it so we're discussing about dressed to kill right before i watched this movie today i've only watched 2 others movies from brian de palma so i can say i don't really know that well his works but can tell from afar that these 2 movies for me were as great as they could be carrie 1976 and mission impossible 1996 when i watched carrie on the tv i was really that desperate to get a dvd copy and i can tell this movie is great mission impossible also and today i watched a third movie from depalma br br well dressed to kill is a movie like kalifornia when the movie goes on it goes completely different than what you'd expect i was watching very curious the scene of the museum where dickinson follows the mysterious man to his cab and they end together in an apartment room you may guess what may have happened there but when the movie reached the scene of the elevator the movie went completely on a different path i was watching the rest of the movie and i really liked it however there are some low points some characters in the movie are completely silent take for example the mysterious man from the museum scene i was always hoping that he could say something but he never did this was totally ridiculous and was with no doubt something that made me change my mind by not accepting this movie as at least almost something as a masterpiece even in the cab scene where dickinson tries to apologize because of what happened in the museum the completely silent man grabs her pulls her inside the cab and they start kissing each other you know it reminded me of the mexican tv series of the 70's el chavo del 8 where some characters are completely silent getting past these low points of the movie it is actually a great movie considering the suspense the characters and the plot dennis franz is cool as detective marino reminded me of him as capt carmine lorenzo in die hard 2 1990 where he plays almost the same kind of character br br well concluding this review the ending of dressed to kill is the same ending as it is in carrie i don't know if i really liked that because i hate imitations i understand that carrie is a movie from depalma so it's not actually an imitation because after all it was his idea but it turned to be a repetitive idea in dressed to kill so depalma could have done something different instead of showing nancy allen waking up from a bad dream the same way it happens to amy irving at the ending scene of carrie this was of course with no doubt another low point but if you get past this you will find that dressed to kill is a really good movie and i assure you that it's not by any means a waste of time watching it
<START> very businesslike authority with little responsibility and only a desire to keep his her name clean check a veteran cop that has bad relationship with his family check mafia guys that while criminals want to do something good vigilante style check a sociopath and loyal mafia guy not hesitant to kill people to make an example check cops' methods being less effective than the mafia guy's brutal yet very effective methods check a corrupt cop tying the authority the criminals and the police together check br br slow motion and or jerky frame rates for showing what the actor's reaction can't check a serial killer whose background is explained in far too much detail esp using childhood abuse as the reason for everything check a child spree killer that is very very non menacing check foreshadowing of the veteran cop's moral values not being what the killer deserves in the movie's and the majority of characters' opinion check morally ambiguous and predictable ending thanks to the foreshadowing and the good veteran cop's coming to terms he should submit to the vigilante attitude of the majority of the characters check br br recently saw this on tv and decided to endure it because it had dennis hopper in it and i could not sleep check realized that was a mistake and should just have stared at the ceiling check
<START> easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays it has been seriously let down here shoddy direction stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy br br in the town of verona the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo patrick rycart a montague falls in love with juliet rebecca saire a capulet bloodshed soon erupts br br the studio work especially in daytime scenes seriously stagnates the energy of the play it's a story that with it's energy deserves to be shot outdoors coupled with this the costumes are hideous with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces the stage fighting looks horrendous with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging br br patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo he manages the character's intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland often inexpressive eyes limit his range it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet she captures the character's naivetÃ© but a little more sassiness would have been welcome br br the supporting roles don't fare much better joseph o'connor's friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut anthony andrews' mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result alan rickman underplaying his role has virtually no presence as tybalt he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years but that isn't in evidence here the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera only micheal hordern in probably his best role in this series comes out of this with any dignity his capulet is well played and a joy to watch br br see one of the other versions of this story instead
<START> i remember having a pretty low regard for a venture like this when it was first released james not jim belushi a hammy kid actress and a cheesy title in a john hughes formula you couldn't have paid me to see it 15 years ago but i got caught up watching it while wasting away a sunday afternoon and it hits me on a couple of levels the fairy tale part pretty woman part reverse pretty woman the very vulnerable elizabeth perkins in miracle on 42nd street like performance by kelly lynch the escapism over all it gently pulls some very nice strings it's pretty hard not to fall into the story develop a crush on kelly lynch identify with james belushi dislike the stiff bad guy boyfriend and laugh at the curley sue lines has all the ups and downs with a happy ending and the kind of message you want to hear go ahead waste your time on this movie it's worth it
<START> no words can describe my utter hatred for this appalling rendition of the btk killer rating this film one out of ten compliments this truly disastrous excuse for a film from start to finish there was not one single highlight the entire thing was horrendously put together the script acting plot lighting direction acting factual information acting just to name a few a number of scenes are literally laugh out loud funny for the atrocious way in which the entire thing is put together this review may seem like an unjust and scathing attack on a low budget film but this is not the case just thinking about the movie i have just seen makes my blood start to boil how this film was ever granted rights for production i will never know i am almost tempted to actually recommend btk because it is truly a stand out in regards to how pathetic and disturbingly awful it is i can honestly say in all my years of film going this is the worst movie ever i wasted over an hour of my life on this useless garbage and would gladly have jumped off the nearest building beforehand had i known what i was in for zero out of ten
<START> clearly rips off hideo nakata's ringu ring 1998 and hongurai mizu no soko kara dark water 2002 with hints of ju on the grudge 2000 but atrociously done gore a green corpse with red eyes weak story and a weak theme i find it very difficult to find a picture message scary there were two moments in this film that made me shudder both involving an unexpected hand and after oodishon another miike takashi one this one from 1999 had me tingling all over for hours after seeing it and all of the films this steals from were actually scary i can't see this film as anything other than a sell out to the western popularity of the big japanese horror films two out of ten
<START> mystery men is one of those movies that gets funnier over time there is a naive innocence and niceness to the characters it has become part of our family culture and we quote the characters often it is my favorite film of the last two years my kids are 13 and 11 and we all three love this film great acting and comedy we love galaxy quest and monty python flicks too okay we're not talking intellectual here just family bonding
<START> ghost of dragstrip hollow appears to take place in a spotless netherworld an era long gone by where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be in defying the law and getting a traffic ticket it opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival who pressures her into a car race that's about it for the drag racing this b flick is mostly concerned with rock 'n roll man the folks at american international were obviously fond of decent square teens who liked to party and yet didn't mind an adult chaperone there are a few amusing double entendres and fruity exchanges necking kid we thought we'd come out for some fresh air dad where did you think you'd find it down her throat but the ghost is a little late in arriving brief at 65 minutes the movie cheats us with a climactic car race that actually takes place off screen and a pre scooby doo styled unmasking which makes no sense however for nostalgia buffs some mindless fun from
<START> holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world some 2 million children are trafficked every year and does so sensitively and without manipulation a tall order that the team at priority films does with great success american actor ron livington stars in the film alongside newcomer thuy nguyen a vietnamese actress who plays holly and together they bring to screen what is commonplace to the people at the notorious k11 redlight district in cambodia although it tackles a heavy topic the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close keeping the two hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch i am glad a film like this is bringing the world's attention to the problem child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step it's great and a film everyone must see
<START> i commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a thumbs in the middle review remarking that i'd give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode i've seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in june 2006 and as a lifelong batman fanatic i can say without hesitation this show is utter crap br br everything's wrong with it everything getting past just the lousy animation and design the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories br br and for god's sake is it just me or is the joker in every episode is gotham that much of a revolving door justice system or again is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains see no character development above br br and to make matters worse every single joker tale is the same 3 part formula br br 1 joker gasses people br br 2 joker sets out to gas the whole city br br 3 batman saves the day br br pfeh br br there was one episode i saw that wasn't a joker story the title escapes me but the villain was that nefarious cluemaster the think thank thunk episode with the quiz show that was the single worst batman story i've ever seen heard or read yes worse than i've got batman in my basement br br i can't really say what i feel this show is because it's probably against the tos but it starts with b and rhymes with fastardization thank goodness for the existence of the timm dini etc era of bat entertainment back from the fox and kids wb days stuff that good and i should have known this just couldn't possibly have lasted forever unfortunately
<START> this may be the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical ever even the music has been destroyed attenborough knows nothing about theater almost every shot and moment ring false i will say though that it is almost bad enough to be funny br br the hairstyles are remarkably dated i can not for the life of me understand what is meant conceptually by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where a chorus line is playing are we to think that these people are auditioning for a chorus line which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning oh no the show is collapsing on itself br br i saw the original production and have listened to the album hundreds of times why oh why did they do this
