<START> i was looking on imdbs bottom 100 because i thought id never seen anything as bad as plan 9 from outerspace or roller ball remake i was wrong ben and arthur has beaten both br br this out of the many countless amount of movies i've seen is the number one worst film on the i ever saw bad directing bad characters horrible acting horrible story there's a reason nobody but sam ever says anything positive about this film sam was a horrible annoying actor but his directing was so bad he may just overthrow ed wood br br the director should be ashamed of his work unfortunately i have to give it at least 1 star but it deserves to be continued stars
<START> i have lately got into the habit of purchasing any interesting dvd that the criterion company releases i figure that even if i dislike the movie criterion usually supplies enough extra material to compensate for any shortcomings in the actual film i read up on them and i buy the ones which are the most interesting to me br br le million is my latest purchase and i must say that i was not disappointed in the film it is cheery funny and romantic everything about it is quite excellent the songs are wonderful if i understood french i would probably hum them and sing them all day long the acting is very good for this kind of movie american musicals of the classic hollywood era relied more on song and dance than the actual characters and story but in le million the characters are rather well developed and the story while not being anything extremely impressive is not at all lacking i loved the developments of the relationships especially the relationship between the once best friends michel and prosper the romantic moments are also very well developed the direction is nearly perfect with several very memorable moments probably the single most perfect scene of the film occurs right after the lead couple has an argument they hide on the stage of an opera performance and the opera singers sing lines which the couple michel and beatrice interpret to their own situation this is definitely one of the high points in cinema history the scene managed to make me laugh to win me over with a very sweet romance and make me smirk at just how clever the director was i give this film a 9 10 br br p s some information for anyone who has the same faith in criterion that i do and is planning to buy it amongst the criterion discs i now own le million contains the fewest features all it has is a photo gallery not all that useful one might flip through it once and a rare television interview with rene clair the director this piece is of some interest he was one of the many directors who had started out in silent film and when talkies were first appearing he said that they represented the death of film i think most film savvy people understand what these directors meant when they said that but it is interesting to hear him explain it also if you have read the description of this movie on amazon com please note that they were wrong in one important respect not every line in the film is sung in fact it contains no more songs than a regular musical it is actually a lot more like a chaplin or buster keaton or marx brothers film my criticisms of the disc are not that important heck criterion has the right to smack me around for making those complaints the fact is their people probably spent hundreds of hours fixing up a film which only 20 now 21 people have voted for on imdb and only about a hundred people if that will ever see the film heck if you look at the criterion web site le million is nowhere to be found i have no clue why not it's something they should really be proud of of course their web site is surprisingly horrible they did a fine job on this film bravo they deserve all the money i can stand to give them
<START> br br i really liked this film one of those rare films that hollywood really does not make anymore william h macy is just great as the hit man with a soul and neve campbell is just flat out fantastic as the woman who puts his life on the track of redemption br br if you have a chance see this film it earns it's praise
<START> when i first found out that brian krause was going to be in this movie i wanted to watch it took me weeks to realize that i've seen the original of this and loved it so i had even more reason to watch well i watched it was actually better than most sequels for tv movies i hate what happens to brian's character you can find out for yourself and i didn't like most of the characters brian's one included but the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk like characters to make stanley caldwell judd nelson shine once more at the end i was cheering for stanley and his own happy ending if you liked the original cabin by the lake or if you like horror movies without the blood i'd suggest you watch this
<START> pushing daisies is just a lovely fairy tale with shades of amelie 's aesthetic and romance it's got a beautiful palette its shots well thought out and detailed its names and dialogue whimsical and too cutesy to be real its imagination great and its romance deep br br watch the blue in the sky pop out at you as blue can't be found in the rest of the sets or shots with few exceptions br br watch a weirdly natural and totally satisfying song break out of a scene br br its score is gorgeous its cast is supremely likable there's great music and the two leading romantic stars can't touch each other or she'll die how much more sexual tension do you need actually i had wished they found a way around this one but c'est la vie br br it is simply a show that it is a pleasure to spend an hour with and i recommend it highly there hasn't been other television quite like it and i would like to see more it got me through a flu one crappy week as it makes for good company br br bring it back
<START> eddie izzard is nothing short of a comedic genius and this is eddie at his very best his material is extremely witty and hilarious and his delivery is some of the best ever witnessed on stage instead of insulting the audience's intelligence he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences hitler the moon landing and the british with so many memorable laughs one can't help but repeat some of his lines forever more do you have a flag should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine every fan of top notch standup comedy needs to see dress to kill by far the best british standup comedian i've ever witnessed eddie izzard has struggled for success off of the live stage however his lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how extremely talented he genuinely is dress to kill is a treasure one that luckily has found its way to home video and can and should be enjoyed again and again
<START> the past few months i have collected voyager seasons 4 to 7 on dvd i only had 1 to 3 on video before that because kes is my favourite character and have just reached the end i saw them when they were originally shown on tv here in the uk but had forgotten most of it am i satisfied with the ending i think i am naturally as i fan i would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that's left to our imagination in many ways endgame is similar to next gen's all good thingsÂ the involvement of the crew in the future but mainly the captain a new romance starting in the finale troi and worf in next gen and seven of nine and chakotay here which results in death in the future i truly loved endgame fair to all characters neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier b'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband tom tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important the doctor in the future is well respected by all and finally chooses the name joe but of course the captain has the largest role meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties the borg are involved as they have played a massive part in this period of voyager alice krige plays the borg queen again fantastically just her voice and acting method are magnificent i feel sorry for susanna thompson though the tv borg queen replaced by the movie borg queen maybe she wasn't available though the special effects are fantastic the borg sub space hub and the borg queen falling apart it's very tense especially when they come out of the borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they'd be after they'd said they'd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant and what a wonderful idea to get inside a borg sphere for protection on the dvd special features they say it was like the trojan horse voyager could have continued if it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home like in harry's speech and what tom said because his wife and child are there and then they could have got home in a film br br overall voyager was a bit hit and miss the sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one the two episodes set in the holographic irish village are horrible my perception of seven of nine was that she took over it all revolved around her which wasn't true when she first appeared season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that and her character is ingenious at times 20 years as a borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity i like her especially in someone to watch over me imperfection and human error when naomi wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side that was lovely chakotay became my least favourite character gone was the chemistry with janeway will they won't they and you'd never think he was first officer he's completely pushed aside most of the time i loved seeing tom and b'elanna's relationship blossom against the odds i always liked neelix a lot tuvok was good at times especially when he lost his logic gained emotion and was friends with neelix harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times the doctor is probably my favourite seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates tinker tenor doctor spy is fantastic janeway is my favourite captain of any series and you can tell kate mulgrew is really enjoying it br br i wish there was more i love voyager
<START> hey if you have a little over an hour to kill and find paint to be too exciting i'd suggest it if thou you happen to like cheap b movies like me it's good for a giggle other than that i wouldn't suggest that you rent it i'd wait till it comes on the tube say round 4 am on the free access channel of your cable satellite supplier the band that did this sound track by the way was on the road after for about two years after this flick and no they sounded just as bad live according to the two small town reviews i could find on them so once again good if you find grass growing to much fun but good to watch if you like to see how not to shoot a low budget movie
<START> a young woman comes to the home town of his husband after he passed away in an accident she barely settles down in this small town but shortly after loses her little son in a kidnapping and all her hopes this could lead to all kinds following plots in a normal movie find a new partner and being happy finally or depressed enough to struggle and finally kill herself she does try to kill herself but not after a series of severe fights with god she trusts in god only to find that god seems to forgive everyone even the killer well i should be careful here about god the movie doesn't mean a thing against god the way the movie deals the issue is quite interesting not in the woman's point of view or from god's perspective in this way there would be lots of grass growing clouds flying views i suppose rather it's from a third party's eye the movie let us to perceive and doesn't explain a thing br br the movie wouldn't be so interesting were there only the woman there's this man who's everywhere around the woman and obviously in love with her but in his own way he's a funny guy like a clown i should say who shamelessly hangs around our heroine the combination of these two the woman full of tension crying and throwing up always and the man smiling and talking stupidly ends up in a good balance of emotions nothing absurdly wrong or too tedious br br highly recommend
<START> 86 wasted minutes of my life i fell asleep the first time i attempted watching it and i must say i'm not one to ever fall asleep in the cinema br br i have never seen such a pointless plot acted in such a stilted and forced manner and can only surmise that the actors were as hard up as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itself br br everything in this dire adaptation is overacted and if it isn't the wooden acting almost as though you can see the teleprompter then the set itself which is overlit and interfering in utterly unnecessary ways and overdressed to an unimaginable extent is enough to put you off the entire farce br br as to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise any person who does not see that as well as the entire rest of this ludicrous plot telegraphed light years in advance should check their eyesight immediately br br bad acting and from two very decent actors coupled with the hyper coddled branagh trademark overdirection is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself br br on top of it all there is a completely risible undertone of homoerotica in this heightened towards the end of it all i can hope for is that this was such a flop that people shan't try to emulate this level of cinema ever again
<START> my personal opinion is that this movie had no real story line to the first john carpenter's vampires but i don't care i loved it jon bon jovi derek was great in this movie he really mad me believe that he was the person you would never think he was a famous rockstar there were some bad things about this movie like the story line there should have been more to the movie there should have been a sequel to the movie that followed the movies story line and they should have kept the same main characters in all three vampires movies i really liked the clothes that the people wore and the setting they pick in mexico i liked how it was old mexico and not new mexico with the clay houses and the old fashion churches i was a little confused with the vampires and how they were able to walk in churches but it was cool how they didn't follow dracula vampire rules
<START> i've seen some bad things in my time a half dead cow trying to get out of waist high mud a head on collision between two cars a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor human beings living like animals br br but never in my life have i seen anything as bad as the cat in the hat br br this film is worse than 911 worse than hitler worse than vllad the impaler worse than people who put kittens in microwaves br br it is the most disturbing film of all time easy br br i used to think it was a joke some elaborate joke and that mike myers was maybe a high cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie who lost a bet or something br br i shudder
<START> pretty awful but watchable and entertaining it's the same old story if you've lived through the 80s vietnam vets fight together as buddies against injustice back in the states a team meets death wish my favorite br br time goes on the soldiers go home and years later a friend is in trouble no wait in fact the friend is dead and it is his dad that's in trouble our first hero joey is killed by an exceedingly horrifying super pointy meat tenderizer as he tries to defend his father's small store from the local protection gang despite being wheelchair bound from the war desperate for help the father talks to sarge the leader of joey's old unit from vietnam when sarge shows up for the funeral br br well the squeaky wheel gets the grease and the old gang saddles up for the city you can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the movie br br the one thing that drove me crazy is that sarge keeps haranguing his men about planning and about how they're really good at what they do when they plan ahead but joey wouldn't have been put in a wheelchair by a gunshot in vietnam in the first place if the unit hadn't been messing around then when things are going really well in the city as they battle the gangs they do it again for no reason at all they completely bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present phh i raise my hands in disgust foolishness br br there is also a suspicious moment when all present members of the unit make sure to try out the heroin they snatch from the gang to make sure it's real every single one of them hmm br br what are you going to do keep watching i guess the movie isn't too horrible to watch but it is a tease there are all these climactic moments when nothing actually winds up happening the most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the movie the explosives in vietnam joey's death battle and the gang brutally kicking an innocent teddy bear aside poor teddy br br i guess my main beef with this movie is that i feel let down by it even the confusing subplots with mystery helpers and their bizarrely cross purpose motives wasn't enough to save it at the end but someday maybe it'll all come right and they'll make a sequel ha ha ha ha
<START> a failure the movie was just not good it has humor that 5 year olds that will not even giggle at i mean sure some parts were amusing but most of it is not lindsey lohan is a great actress and a bad singer and she should be working on better movies the movie should have been aired as a disney channel original movie that is free br br the only thing that was well done about this movie was the music nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day these songs are so good especially alyson and amanda's walking on sunshine and caleigh peter's beach boy song fun fun fun br br 4 out of 10 if i gave it a ten 9 of that would be the music and 1 will be the movie not worth your money but the soundtrack is
<START> this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business the idea that audiences paid to see this movie and like an idiot i rented the film is discouraging also br br obsessed teacher 3 years prior kills teenager's family because he wants her for no reason he kills the mother father and brother from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction years later obsessed teacher breaks out of prison hmm usual bad writing no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around sniff out people and with a knife is super killer sure now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason knifes bellhop for the fun of it and starts to hunt down the teenager's friends now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel again it is stupid ever cop would know his face but he walks right by them now he kills two cops outside teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend br br there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage if any other profession put out work of this low quality they would be fired yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash
<START> this collection of eleven short stories in one movie is a great idea and presents some great segments but also some disappointing surprises based on the tragic event of the september 11th 2001 in the united states of america eleven directors were invited to give their approach to the american tragedy the result of most of them is not only an individual sympathy to the american people but mainly to the intolerance in the world with different cultures and people br br ken loach uk presents the best segment about the september 11th 1973 in chile when the democratic government of salvador alliende was destroyed by the dictator augusto pinochet with the support of the usa br br the other excellent segments are the one of youssef chahine egypt showing the intolerance in the world and the number of victims made by usa governments in different countries along the contemporary history and the one of mira nair india showing a true story of injustice and prejudice against a pakistanis family whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in usa when he was indeed a hero br br some segments are beautiful samira makhmalbaf iran shows the innocent afghans refugee children preparing an inoffensive shelter against bombs while their teacher tries to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world the romantic claude lelouch france shows the life of a couple in new york nearby the wtc danis tanovic bosnia herzegovina shows the effects of their war in a small location and the lonely protest of widows sean penn is very poetic showing that life goes on and shohei imamura's story is probably the most impressive showing that there is no holy war but sadness and disgrace br br the segment of idrissa quedraogo birkina faso is very naive but pictures the terrible poor conditions of this african nation br br the segment of amos gital israel is very boring and manipulative showing more violence and terrorism br br the segment of alejandro gonzÃ¡lez iÃ±Ã¡rritu is very disappointing horrible without any inspiration and certainly the worst one br br my vote is seven br br title brazil 11 de setembro september 11
<START> personally i think that the film was done very professionally i loved the choreography and the acting the plot is also gripping and mysterious the film itself is very emotional and what i liked about it most is that it makes you think afterwards antonio gades has absolutely lived his role to the end and i must say that it's one of my favourite pictures and saura is a wonderful director
<START> i make just one apology for this film there are far far too many wide angle close ups and if they irritate you beyond endurance fair enough they drove me barmy for the first ten minutes or so but after that i made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography and long before the end of the film i had ceased to care this is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily it's hilarious it's witty the comic delivery of all of the cast is flawless and however much usher peers at his characters through a cold fish eye lens he may not care for them much he manages to present them with warmth mystery men' is in fact not only funnier not only more clever but also deeper than anyone seems to have given it credit for being the jokes in the austin powers movies for instance as well as being less funny than the jokes here are also much more toothless the satire of mystery men' bites when there's something worth biting and gnaws gently when there isn't it doesn't mock just any old thing which is why contrary to what some i must regard them as unobservant critics have said it never runs out of ideas br br the super' heroes are an attractive bunch sure they're second rate but they're not merely second rate the blue rajah for instance does nothing but throw cutlery at people and he isn't that good at it on the other hand neither is he comically bad he's better in his limited field than most people and he does practise diligently he's not a buffoon which makes him a much funnier character than if he was if superman is christ in a cape the mystery men are all the minor demigods from the foothills of mount olympus in capes much funnier also much more endearing
<START> an okay film with a fine leading lady but a terrible leading man stephan jenkins who plays the husband is a truly bad actor joyce hyser on the other hand is the movie's saving grace she's the best actor of the bunch br br note the first comment by the fellow who heaped praise upon the movie and according to his imdb com account has only written one review and guess for what movie is obviously a plant while the movie is nicely shot it's by no means subtle or great or whatever other hypobolic descriptions the reviewer used br br art of revenge is a fair movie but it's a big tease it offers up all manner of sexual situations but never goes through with it like watching a skin flick on cinemax but with all the naughty bits edited out br br the film as a whole is a bit unfocused and the ending and much of the third act is really a big mess there's a twist ending of course since every movie nowadays finds it necessary to have a twist ending br br a 4 out of 10 br br
<START> i liked this movie sort of reminded me of my marriage it is very clean you can see it with family very nicely done songs are ok too i think the writer director is great the movie shows how marriages progress thru time they have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their life the film beautifully depicts quite a few stages in parallel in the same story some of the dialogs are quite good the movie depicts complex human emotion very nicely not with over dramatization also shows perfect is after all not so perfect shows very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new the movie is very well written and directed
