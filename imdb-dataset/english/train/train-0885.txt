<START> i loved this episode it is so great that all 5 of them team up and stop luthercorp and save the world i also love this episode because kyle gallner bart allen impulse and justin hartley oliver queen green arrow are guest starring in it i just hope that clark will join the justice league and we'll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe it was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next i think chloe should also join the team as watchtower that would be such a coool thing for her to do besides the daily planet because she doesn't have super powers also i want to find out what types of subjects lex is going to use for 33 1 i wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have
<START> my ten year old liked it for me it was hard to get through it christopher lloyd played it way over the top and the suit was tedious and unfunny sorry to see jeff daniels in this
<START> the invisible mouse is a delightful and different tom jerry's cartoon it features the usual cat mouse chases and battles but in a different way this time jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of surprises for tom scare him torment him and confuse him br br as much as it is weird it's also very cool and funny to see what we can't see jerry invisible it's amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who's doing it we know who right it's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts it's equally amusing to see jerry eating some candies and fruits while he's invisible i really like that instrumental music which plays when he's not visible br br some of the best jokes on this short are when tom sees jerry's shadow and slams him and even when tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and jerry writes missed me i also like when jerry drinks tom's chocolate milk becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face br br overall this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon humor entertainment fun and some nice artwork too
<START> a singularly unfunny musical comedy that artificially tries to marry the then cutting edge rock 'n' roll explosion with the middle class sensibilities of a suburban sitcom the result is a jarringly dated mish mash that will satisfy none of the audience that went for the music but will at least keep their parents sated br br a quick glance at the promo write up on the back of the video release should give some idea of the content tom ewell is a drunken agent overplayed with so little comic ability you almost expect him to bellow hi honey i'm home the blurb sites him as so funny in 'the 7 year itch' it sounds almost like an excuse what other film would sell itself on the fact that a leading player was good in something else it reads like so funny in 'the 7 year itch' but he's rubbish in this br br mansfield a beautiful girl with rumoured 50 inch assets is unfortunately a bargain basement monroe with all the acting ability and comic timing of a rotting haddock her wooden delivery combined with ewell's ott double takes make this a comedy partnership from hell for her part the sell gives us jayne mansfield whose more obvious talents are the cause of many of the film's biggest laughs as you can see a movie sold on the idea that it's lead has a big chest is not the most sophisticated of things most of this humour is men literally falling over themselves their glasses cracking upon site of mansfield etc only the freudian nightmare of a milk bottle overflowing casts doubt upon its u certificate br br for the musical side the most adenine of players are chosen would you really care to see eddie fontaine offer i love your eyes i love your lips they taste even better than potato chips in a song called cool it baby only the incendiary little richard breaks out of the mor though is forced to sing some of his more dad friendly songs in a four minute sequence and how come all the acts sing without a single microphone attempted satires on the industry are broad and childlike in their conception br br technically the picture was quite advanced with special effects including a ghost like julie london and deluxe color which now looks flat and artificial in fact with its reds that bleed and fake looking flesh tones it resembles a colorised movie direction though isn't outstanding and the sound quality is also quite poor br br perhaps it comes down to it being so old a time when men still smoked on screen sickeningly cute child actors made adult remarks and black servants only got to cook and dance all of which happen here yet some like it hot the african queen ben hur and many many more stand as examples of films from the period that can still be enjoyed today so the good at the time argument doesn't really stand up at its heart the girl can't help it is a cynical and patronising venture that doesn't bear close inspection 4 10 br br
<START> i'd have to say that this was a little embarrassing for the 'king of the cowboys' made in 1948 the picture came out a decade after roy rogers' earliest pictures in which he had a starring role roy's character comes off as a bit clueless in this one along with his female co star jane frazee who alternates her allegiance between roy and robert livingston portraying chief bad guy bill regan the whole story seems kind of muddled with missed opportunities for what could have been an entertaining hour or so like the legend of the 'hangman's hotel' for example which says the hanged man comes to life at midnight with andy devine in the cast as cookie bullfincher you would think the story would get a little mileage out of that set up instead you have some convoluted proceedings that would have been better served if this had been a bowery boys flick it was a sad attempt at a haunted hotel gimmick that relied on poor old genevieve who truth be told wound up getting more screen time than trigger who's contract as 'smartest horse in the movies' didn't have anything to say about getting upstaged by a mule and then you have foy willing and his riders of the purple sage replacing bob nolan and the sons of the pioneers for your musical interlude i don't know about you but it was already half way into the picture and i was still looking for pat brady oh well br br yet there was still an interesting element to be found here if you were looking hard enough and that turned out to be roy's athletic dismount of trigger while still on the run from the bad guys ok it was probably a stunt double but i haven't seen that one before in a couple hundred westerns br br jane frazee does the honors as the female lead in this picture as she would in four other films opposite roy in the 1947 1948 time frame in under california stars she appeared as andy devine's cousin appropriately named caroline bullfincher you're never quite convinced what side she'll come in on in this story though since she starts out pretending to be someone she's not and winds up on the good guy side almost by accident br br fans of the old laurel and hardy films might be as surprised as i was to see james finlayson here as the sheriff of sintown i would have liked a little more comedy relief written into his role but he played it pretty straight after all i had to wonder when it was all over why he and old vanderpool charle coleman wound up in the mine shaft with cookie when there was no reason for that to be just a way to close it out i guess with about as much thought as went into the rest of the picture i hate to be that harsh but if you've seen enough roy rogers flicks you've got to know that this was not one of his finer efforts br br say sintown i wonder if that's the same place that grew up to be sin city
<START> firstly this is a very dated film non focused in its exposition of the left wing political revolution honestly when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to cease to be intellectual which in itself is quite nonsensical since the answer was arrived at by precisely being intellectual it reduces me to despair as if we all should return to being apes in the name of equality it is simply ridiculous our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities but this does not mean we should not educate ourselves to the highest possible degree but no doubt this non educational message ties in with godard's use of rock music hence the rolling stones br br the song 'sympathy for the devil' whose creation we witness and from which the film takes its name is in fact nothing special the chord sequence which is not especially original was used to much better effect in led zeppelin's 'thankyou' led zeppelin ii apart form that 'sir' mick jagger declaims in his usually nebulous manner rather like bob dylan notice how the first melodic phrase is unimaginatively repeated over again to form the verse br br besides the fact that the black panthers depicted in this film don't seem to know what they are fighting for the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography a message that in fact undermines the sexual 'liberation' of the 1960s and today indeed a message that would belie the behaviour of the rolling stones around the time the film was made br br no wonder the dvd came free with the sunday times for a truly profound historical exposition of left wing sympathy listen to luigi nono's masterpiece 'al gran sole carico'd'amore'
<START> if you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood let it be boy but prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio br br after having watched such a good movie as arisan 2003 it is terrible to see what they come up with again in indonesia it seems that the only idea is to make money but no one seems seriously to work on the image of indonesia in the world of entertainment that it is a 'global' world doesn't seem to come up in the minds of those who make movies in indonesia and since the indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as 'made in indonesia' with a flavor of the west they get away with it br br ok the story is nice to begin with and it could have developed into a nice flick but did the director never think about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music or at least good playback and secondly good choreography in this movie the playback is so bad that it makes you wanna cry right there in the cinema every single word you hear is followed seconds later by the actor or whoever sing playback and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie br br the choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics but in the end thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical they only forgot to change the choreography it is hardly dancing you see they jump here and there throw their legs up in the air and that is about it br br well at least there's a happy ending but if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic do so
<START> this film is a twisted nonsense of a movie set in japan about a dysfunctional family who end up with a strange violent guest who just sits back and watches the 4 members of the family at their worst nothing is sacred in this movie with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit i'm surprised it got past the censors br br overall i think it will appeal only to those whom we shouldn't be encouraging rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider a film that panders to the worst element in society and is in anyway utter gash a disappointment from a man who made the sublime dead or alive and audition movies
<START> after a quasi gothic all fruity music video the movie starts with cassidy the lead singer killing herself in a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll we don't live n that world the insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence when i say clown i mean actual clown he tell them they're all going to die via cassidy's ghost the spirit possesses dora one of the band mates we couldn't care less as the characters are all boring vapid and extremely horribly acted written by adam hackbarth an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one and directed by corbin timbrook who after the attendant and tower of blood has to know that he keeps making crap for a living this movie s a constant battle between the film's incompetence and the viewer's need to stay awake not enough blood to appease gore hounds nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs this movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone br br my grade f br br eye candy amanda carraway gets topless br br where i saw it starz on demand
<START> those who are not familiar with cassandra peterson's alter ego elvira then this is a good place to start br br elvira mistress of the dark starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message it seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in las vegas she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money br br unfortunately the place she has to go is the town of fallwell massachusetts having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things a house a dog and a cookbook the town residents have mixed reactions the teens like her the women hate her and the men lust after her although trying to remain moral pillars of the community her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle vincent w morgan sheppard because he wants her cookbook seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock br br the film is actually pretty funny with peterson a k a elvira using her endowments and sexiness as a joke and don't forget tomorrow we're showing the head with two things i mean the thing with two heads especially funny as edie mcclurg as chastity pariah the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line but ends up looking ridiculous the picnic scene is the perfect example deserves a peek the film not her boobs of course
<START> so so special effects get in the way of recapturing the interesting relationship between uncle martin and tim o'hara that we remember from the tv series and what was with the suit annoying
<START> the episodic version of robert heinlein's starship troopers plays out at a deathly slow pace following johnny rico leaving his parents the not very attractive girl he lusts for and joining the mobile infantry the aliens in the show are nothing like the barbaric bugs from the film instead being squid like monsters that shoot lasers out of their mouths br br throughout watching this version i was continually amazed at just how fruity they've managed to make the whole thing the show is concerned mostly with the relationships between the recruits and the aching prolonged gazes they give each other through their battle armour visors with 80s synth pop sometimes arriving during the sparse battle sequences which at last turning up in the final few episodes in terms of construction it owes a debt to top gun sharing much in terms of pacing and content and all that implies
<START> don't get me wrong i want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy i shall digress now the writing though was unrealistic a pta mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person give me a break the smugness of very pretty mary louise parkers character was an insult to my intelligence the characters were not at all likable basically the plot lines went nowhere i understand its only tv land the hypocrisy was blatant mary louise parker is supposed to be a great mom and i am supposed to believe this why i just got the feeling i was being preached by a show reeking of seediness its like saying its ok to cheat on your wife but with someone of legal age status ok not exactly the same thing but i think you people get my point that save the children stuff is wonderful for campaign trails i guess but it does not hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom as the local pot dealer
<START> very slick very pre hays code and still very sassy i would highly recommend seeing this movie even if you are not a fan of stynwyck she's funny she's sexy she's hard working and love that perm she gets br br barbara stynwyck is fantastic as a doozie of a floozy who rises up in the world perfectly portrayed by a bank building john wayne in a suit plays one of her first conquests br br the last three minutes are a letdown but the sets the lines the clothes all add to one heck of a movie about rising vertically in the horizontal position
<START> this has been put out on the dvd market by alpha and it's for die hard boris karloff fans like moi only it's not a horror flick but a drama where boris is a struggling scientist agreeing to kill a wealthy woman's husband in order to gain the fortune needed to continue with his work but once the dying victim changes his will and leaves his spouse nothing all hell breaks loose br br it's appeasing enough seeing karloff as another selfish sinister type and some of the acting is unintentionally hilarious especially from the leading lady mona goya who is absolutely a laugh riot as the double crossed wife br br but proceed with much caution
<START> given the people involved it is hard to see why this movie should be so messed up and dull the writer david ward wrote the amazing caper film the sting two years later jane fonda had just won an academy award for klute and donald sutherland had just done excellent work in films like klute start the revolution without me and kelly's heroes plotwise the movie is a caper tale with a small gang of bumbling misfits planning a big heist at the same time the movie wants to be hip satire a series of comedy sketches of the type that the nbc television show saturday night would do so well two years later the bad result is that the plot makes the comedy bits seem awkward and forced and the disconnected comedy bits destroy any kind of suspense that the heist might have it is quite literally a movie that keeps smashing into itself just as the cars in the cars in the demolition scenes run into each other br br the only real interest for me was watching jane fonda her iris caine is supposed to be a light hearted version of her dramatic bree daniels prostitute character in klute yet one doesn't believe her for a moment it is always jane fonda pretending to be a prostitute that we are watching it is as terrible a performance as her performance in klute was terrific it would be a good lesson for acting teachers to run the two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be great or pathetic it suggests that actors are only as good as their writers and directors
<START> i cannot believe that the indian film industry still puts out such third rate dross as waqt for starters the storyline is totally implausible Â spoilt son gets thrown out of family home so as to teach him some self sufficiency so what does he do he promptly goes on to win some national talent contest by doing some star jumps in front of a panel of judges i honestly am not joking here in the meantime his dad is dying of lung cancer but keeps it a secret from the son but he survives long enough to see his son become famous to see his new grandson and also make a new toy giraffe with his own hands br br the acting is cringe worthy in its hamminess Â no effort was made to try and act in any convincing manner by any of the main players in this film as usual for indian films the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the concerns of the real world br br to be honest the main losers when such dire films are made are the intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a film the actors such as amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar will still be revered as gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in bollywood
<START> i thought this film would be a lot better then it was it sounded like a spoof off of the spy gener and the start of it reminded me of pleasantvil but this film came up short br br the plot is just to ridiculous the kgb and soviet union in russia have started up a spy school to teach their spies' how to act like americans but the town they set up in it for training is a bit dated so they grab two yanks from the us to spice things up i don't know but this seems just to out there it gets really odd when next to no one in this all russian town speaks in a russian accent someone screwed up in the casting job br br also for a comedy this is painfully dry there is one two funny spots tops and they are nothing to sing and dance about the film in the end will likely put you to sleep br br and as a twisted punch in the face this film is so pro the us it makes me sick the movie keeps on saying again and again the us is god and russia is the devil this is the kind of smear campaign that was done against the japanese in world war 2 it's films like these that makes everyone think that the us is full of itself br br this gets a 4 out of 10 and i'm being kind it should really get a one but the dance scene was funny but then again it dragged far to long to be really funny
<START> it's difficult to not have a liking for israeli director eytan fox and for his movies which describe the life in the middle east and the inherent problems gay people can have in these regions besides he also gave voice to the young generations and to the remarkable part of them who really need peace and who want to take no further notice of a war that for too much time marked the existences of people both in israel both in palestine these reasons in my opinion are sufficient to consider fox a noteworthy director even when his feeling for the melodrama is a tad out of control however the fans of his movies that he realized on team with gal uchovsky his producer co screenwriter and also life companion seem to not being vexed by this since his new feature the bubble ha buah is having the same success of the previous yossi jagger and walk on the water announced as a contemporary gay version of romeo juliet set in the present day tel aviv instead of verona and with two men one israeli and the other palestinian at the place of the two shakespearean young lovers the film actually is quite different from that or better it's also something else in fact the bubble of the title is the world apart in which the leading man noam played by the fox regular ohad knoller yossi in yossi jagger but i must confess i miss jagger the astonishing yehuda levi and his two co tenants a guy and a girl chose to live around thirty years old restless witty and firm despite the protagonist just spent a period as national service in a checkpoint on the frontier with the palestine to live a life that won't be only made of war the two guys are gay and along with the girl they have established a trio in which they brotherly love and support each other their lives are destined to change when noam falls in love with ashraf the tv star yousef 'joe' sweid a young palestinian who came to live in tel aviv the laws so far in force among the group are neglected but not the will to aid one friend still it won't be easy for noam and his friends 'cause ashraf is clandestine in israel and in the meantime his family who lives in palestine and doesn't know he's gay is looking forward to settle his wedding with a very beautiful girl who is a relative of ashraf's beloved sister bridegroom to be who he is also a terrorist and he will have a strong liability in the development of the plot with consequences not just for the two men because the prejudices against the homosexuality and the peace interesting dualism if not automatic are stubborn and so the tragedy is unavoidable even if the film focus on the obstacles the relationship between noam and ashraf meets with it doesn't the overlook the other characters which turn out well written for example golan the boyfriend of yelli noam's fellow tenant introduced as a lively boor and then disclosed as a sweeter and more open minded person and aptly performed besides the two leads we mustn't disregard the funny zohar liba and the lovely daniela virtzer the girl of the gang moreover late marriage's star lior ashkenazi appears as himself in a cameo it also melds the gloomy tones with the more brilliant ones even if the director can't do without a melodramatic conclusion i watched this movie more than a month ago and in the meantime i often thought about it proof that fox and his pal have a knack to strike home
<START> gunga din 1939 is based on rudyard kipling's poem the movie is directed by george stevens it's set in india during the 19th century where three british soldiers have to stop an evil guru and his murderous cult gunga din is a marvelous adventure war comedy with plenty of thrilling moments the three leading men are brilliant cary grant is sgt archibald cutter victor mclaglen is sgt 'mac' macchesney and douglas fairbanks jr the son of the legendary you know who is sgt thomas ballantine let's not forget the other fine players who include sam jaffe playing gunga din himself in a brilliant way the beautiful and gifted joan fontaine is emaline stebbins it's awfully fun to watch the difficulties of tommy's and emmy's wedding plans gunga din is awfully lot of fun it can be funny it can be thrilling it can be everything a good movie requires
