<START> bela lugosi revels in his role as european horticulturalist sic dr lorenz in this outlandish tale of horror and dementia the good doctor's aging wife needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins in order to retain her youth and beauty what better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows sedating them into a coma like state he brings them to his mansion to collect his tainted bounty according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis that brief description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the movie br br the corpse vanishes 1942 wallace fox bela lugosi luana walters elizabeth russell
<START> wow i have seen so many bad low budget films lately but this one is great the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series i loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent clichÃ© about the police this film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time a perfect tradeoff
<START> first of all i thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by preston sturges sturges was one of the better hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired however it wasn't the preston sturges it was preston sturges jr the story was essentially based on robert louis stevenson's short story the bottle imp a good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell that's fine nobody said screenwriters had to be original the actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen my biggest complaint comes with the ending the hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person at first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film this is a stupid convention the older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end there is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think you can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end in fact i think it's preferable
<START> this film was one of the worst i've seen in a long while br br it's a combination police drama and comedy about two hollywood detectives harrison ford and josh hartnett investigating a shootout at a hip hop club br br the plot is contrived and there are way too many side issues going on ford is hustling real estate on the side martin landau is one of his clients hartnett runs a yoga school where he's hustling chicks in his spare time the two are under investigation by internal affairs ford is screwing the ex girlfriend lena olin of the ia investigator and she's a psychic who has a radio show the man who set up the killing at the club is a dirty ex cop who shot hartnett's father years ago br br toss in the obligatory car chases and some lame attempts at humor and that's about the gist of this turkey
<START> any film which begins with a cowhand shagging a female calf can't promise much as for the stereotyping of the kibbutz as it was 50 yrs ago well i was there and it just wasn't like that ok every kibbutz had just a small piece of something shown in the film like youngsters raiding the kitchen at night but you can't show the whole kibbutz as being full of all those shall we say naughty traits each kibbutz had its own problems but hardly any kibbutz had all of them the views of israel were great i still remember my youth in that garden of eden called the emek valley yes and the acting was good too so you see it wasn't all black just a wrong portrayal probably on purpose too
<START> i didn't even want to watch this movie after reading maltin's review and 1 1 2 star rating i watched it anyway on the advice of my son and found it much better than i expected i would give it 2 1 2 stars out of a 4 star system you have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all if you don't know much about religion you will miss a lot i graduated from high school the year the movie was made so maybe i can relate to it better yes there is some pretension in the movie and it's weird to some extent but that was the 70s so what do you expect i can see why people might not like the movie however i cannot understand people saying it is boring the movie is anything but boring you will either hate it or love it if you find it boring you are probably brain dead
<START> this film is more about how children make sense of the world around them and how they and we use myth to make sense of it all i think it's been misperceived everyone going in expecting a stalkfest won't enjoy it but if you want a deeper story it's here
<START> i couldn't believe the comments made about the movie br br as i read the awful opinions about the movie i actually wondered if you had actually viewed the same movie that i did br br what i viewed was incredible i think the actresses and director did a fantastic job in the movie br br i hadn't had the pleasure to see either actress previously and i couldn't have been more set back by the incredible job that they did i'd have to say its the most believable movie that i've seen in a long time br br what i don't see is why everyone has such a problem with deanna's choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice that i don't understand its a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how it can be the actresses error i fail to see i think it was a real believable movie that i would see again and recommend opinions are what the are and its too bad that so many are so close minded i hope to see any of the actors soon i think that all played great roles br br busy philipps will be the highest paid actress someday and i hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her you go girl
<START> peter sellers one of my favorite actors is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey but the script is so lame and insulting that even goldie hawn's youth just after her oscar win cannot begin to pull this one out of the mud as a skirt chasing celeb in his 40's sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degree br br a 3 out of 10 best performance nicky henson plays a young study type br br i hope hawn and sellers were paid well because i see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 a very good year for films catch 22 m a s h husbands joe wusa five easy pieces and many others you can't win them all
<START> yeah madsen's character whilst talking to the woman from the tv station is right the lapd is a corrupt violent and racist police and this movie changes nothing about it okay here are the good cops the moral cops even a black one whow a christian a martyr but this is a fairy tale admit it reality is not like that and most important for the action fans the shoot out is boring it's just shooting and shooting and shooting nothing more play counter strike then you will at least have something to do the only moral of this film is the lapd is good now no more bad cops in it if you like uncritical euphemistic commercials for police and military service watch this movie it's the longest commercial i've ever seen 2 points for camera and editing
<START> an overlong but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader steve biko and donald woods the first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men and how they help each other out but the second half isn't as strong due to the elimination of the biko character still its a compelling film with great performances by kline and washington in the film that put the latter on the map washington was also was nominated for best supporting actor for the first time overall a well made film that could have been trimmed down a bit 7 10
<START> funny how a studio thinks it can make a sequel to what was a classic christmas story with an entirely new cast and expect it to float sure they used various actors for batman but in that instance batman was a classic character before any of the actor donned his cape in this instance you had a classic character in the blond headed horn rimmed glasses wearing ralphy that wanted a red ryder bb gun for christmas somehow we are supposed to forget him and accept another little boy that share no resemblance to the original if i had not known it was a sequel i wouldn't have guessed it from the cast except of course charles grodin tries so hard to imitate darrin mcgavin that your are constantly reminded that the original was far better br br in the end it might have work if they had cast the movie better they should have looked for look a likes or simply ignored the original and not tried to copy its look and feel this one is just a cheap imitation the ralphy evokes no sympathy just a desire to seem his character shoot his eye out or die
<START> labored comedy has i r s agent tony randall investigating eccentric farm family in maryland who have never paid their taxes debbie reynolds is the tomboy farmer's daughter who puts the squeeze on the not so disinterested tax man debbie certainly made her share of inferior theatrical sitcoms during this period and this one's no better or worse than the rest picture begins brightly but flags at the halfway point becoming frantic and witless randall isn't a bad match for reynolds but the vehicle itself defeats the chemistry based on the novel the darling buds of may by h e bates with a poor sound mix causing all the actors to sound as if they're stuck in an echo chamber from
<START> note to previous reviewer this movie is science fiction adaptation of the iliad according to the screenwriter so whether the references are painful or not no apologies it is the basis for the film they admit they stole though adapted is the p c term br br great flick but too short probably didn't come out as well as the author director or studio wanted but pretty damn fun the fact that the studio itself imploded during the making only helps add to its legacy br br a big budget remake wouldn't be as fun and probably wouldn't do the screenplay any more justice but it's fun to dream about the potential there a dvd release with some meager extras is apparently available but i don't think it would play on ntsc players i'm no expert and thus still trying to figure this out for now i live with the vhs incarnation
<START> this video guide was the masterpiece of the year 1995 beautifully done matthew perry and jennifer aniston have major on screen chemistry when they talk about what the start button does i'm waiting for microsoft to release a special edition dvd complete with deleted scenes bill gates commentary a documentary of how windows 95 compares to windows xp and more br br overall 10 10 should have won at least a golden globe
<START> this film is awful not offensive but extremely predictable the movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid 60's the father the principal at the school is going through a mid life crisis enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students' minds with some thought provoking stuff like think for yourself the principal doesn't agree with her teaching but she is pretty you can connect the dots his teenage daughter winona ryder wannabe tara frederick is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live she gets some bad advice hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn't being taught at her school shocking seeing that director paul shapiro has mainly worked in tv this movie plays like a more adult version of an after school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms
<START> the invisible ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of boris karloff and bela lugosi karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others even his wife his already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid br br lugosi plays the consummate professional who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone but still seems to have no real close friends this was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well it is hard however to hear his accent and believe he is french br br the biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on junk science but in a way even the junk science makes it work well since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic they are as relevant today as they were when the movie was made and they are also as forward reaching and always will be br br this is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again i saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and i could easily sit through it five more times the acting is marvelous and the science is amusing i highly recommend it
<START> well this was not a surprise many people will tell you this is gory but they are all talking shiztz this film is very slow br br it starts off with some guy who makes a concoction to feel no pain he calls it my son there is some gory scenes but i found them kind of weak you might as well skip 40 minutes of the movie and get to the eyeball scene which was surprisingly impressive and sickening there is some really stupid scenes in this and they dub over the hits and slaps with stupid fake slapping sound which makes me laugh i would not recommend it keep looking gore hounds br br check this out if you want the like 20 10 minute ending scene which still is not that amazing and has a random scene of the guy trying to like rape his mum yeah its weird
<START> a wonder one of the best musicals ever the three busby berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible non stop patter and the natural acting of cagney and blondell keeler is also lovely even though she may not have been a great actress there's a freshness in the movie that you don't see in flicks today much less in the usually stilted 30s films even though the plot involving the setting up of movies prologues is quite dated
<START> this film is excellently paced you never have to wait for a belly laugh to come up for more than about a minute and there's much more going on than the initial premise of the film throughout it there are mockeries of the traditional schmaltzy local boys done good overcoming adversity genre of which this parodies don't let anyone tell you that they're trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities sure there's plenty of that but it's all contextual not gratuitous i loved this film and it only cost me Â£2 99 on dvd so in terms of entertainment value for money it has been the best film i've seen this year
