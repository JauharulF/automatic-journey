<START> easily the worst movie i have ever seen in my life direction none story pathetic screenplay that will be a good idea there is a lot of gratuitous graphics all of pathetic quality preserve your sanity dont ever see this movie
<START> somewhat funny and well paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless fast talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding u s treasury agent david morse to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief hacker doug hutchinson who stole forty two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead br br bait marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua the replacement killers and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn't top his first movie what the two films have in common is the action sequences which are flat out excellent br br foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning but throughout the film i began to catch on hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in marathon man morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost
<START> this esteemed production has it's fans but to paraphrase the classic bad review of 'mary reilly ' moby dick is like a painting only slower br br this is because the philosophical grounds for a movie production are never to make a great film rather it's to substitute the lack of a strong guiding idea in this case for a books transference to film with a list of hopelessly atomized undynamic but dazzling conceits in an effort to trick viewers into thinking they've seen greatness as viewers critics are apt to fall for this oscars follow feeding the whole dumb equation br br i don't share in the pleasure all these reviewers found moby dick is stunningly uninvolving actors dutifully recite essays about jonah moby dick the ocean moby dick moby dick all things that can't respond and not one of which is absorbing in the slightest it's dramatically inert it doesn't build in narrative terms moby dick as a movie is little more than a foregone conclusion in search of an actual story after half an hour i was muttering oh terrific another oath another 4 minute soliloquy br br in the failed effort to involve you it's a pretty campy overacting showcase a lot of grey hair here starbuck is supposed to be a golden god br br one knows one is looking at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than trying to replicate the feel of someone else's paintings palette or reverently embalming a classic as huston does here paintings and books are nice but they're a different mediums a movie like this fails to grasp that an honestly enjoyable piece of crap village of the damned is better in most respects than an insufferable piece of culture this is the eat your vegetables school of film making br br one appreciates the work that must have been done to make the movie but not the narrative only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work various sea efforts and the technology of whaling and that doesn't call for a two plus hour movie
<START> i don't know where to start the acting the special effects and the writing are all about as bad as you can possibly imagine i can't believe that the production staff reached a point where they said our job is done time for it's release i'm just glad the first two in the series never made it as far as the uk i would actually recommend watching this film just so you can appreciate how well made most films are br br i don't know how any of the other imdb users could find it scary when the terrifying dinosaurs waddle down corridors with rubber arms flailing around
<START> suffice it to say that this substandard b has nothing to save it not an interesting plot or even one tolerably decent actor josh leonard of blair witch fame does little to help matters do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf at your local video store
<START> for anyone who's judged others at first meeting here is the perfect tutorial on depth of character the grumpy old lady has a soft thoughtful heart and needs new friends the flighty unsure 'ditsy' dame who makes inappropriate uncomfortable comments sees deep into your soul and has pure love for all the cold prim proper neglected wife has passion simmering that could boil over at any minute given the right setting the perfect beauty rich sweet partying pursued by throngs wants peace quiet and love without possessiveness br br by taking the time to look beyond the surface you will find treasures in everyday life from the least expected sources all it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment
<START> pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning as an example bonnie and clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds why they were two people caught up in the depression when people were desperate to survive br br this film has absolutely no substance the viggo mortensen character soon emerges as a folk hero why he speeds along an idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his stricken wife has been taking no one bothers to understand why he is trying to flee everyone even worse when the realization becomes apparent that he is not a red neck terrorist no one in government wants to help him as they try to save their rear ends br br jason priestley co stars as a radio emcee who builds upon the story in support of our hero br br the ending is absolutely unbelievable
<START> this was actually my favorite series of scooby doo when i was younger i thought each episode had more of an edge to it and the villains had a lot of creative thought put into them and even very scary and believable as well some of the best episodes were i left my neck in san francisco twenty thousand screams under the sea the ghoul the bat and the ugly and when you wish upon a star creature if you have never seen these episodes please do this series was a bit of a mixed bag though as there were other episodes which didn't seem to have the same kind of edge to them such as rocky mountain yiiii and the ransom of scooby chief as like the series before it it was very well put together interesting storyline and brilliantly drawn as everyone says though it would have been so much better without scrappy doo the character was tiresome and distracting to the story that was being told
<START> i remember watching the bsg pilot i can describe that night exactly i remember what chair i sat in that show was magic it came alive i enjoyed the first two years of bsg i enjoyed parts of the third year even and i watched every episode of the fourth year totally faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around well it didn't br br i watched the caprica pilot and was enthralled there was hope for something good here then i started watching the regular episodes and they are getting more and more boring br br it's too obvious too predictable it reminds me of the droll political correctness of his last failed show virtuality br br much of his line work on ds9 was good when he focused on bsg in an organized way it was good this was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first bsg series when they departed from that after meeting up with admiral cain and the pegasus it all went to pot it was like he wrote the rest of the show without knowing where he was going br br maybe it will improve maybe it was just a few weak initial episodes but i am very very nervous
<START> when i first tuned in on this morning news i thought wow finally some entertainment it was slightly amusing for a week or so but we have to face it these news reporters if one can even call them that have way too much playing around time br br at first i thought jillian was a breathe of fresh air but seriously this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her she is very unprofessional she keeps on interrupting steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report it's just really become annoying to the point that i can't watch it anymore br br jillian is not a good journalist hell she's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity hence she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she's supposed to be interviewing she's not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist and that's all i can say about her br br also disappointingly this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world the government the us or something that will benefit and or serve the public's best interest they're too focus on sensationalism that everything they talk about comes off as a commercial product on the other hand their field reporters are interestingly tolerable br br i believe good day la is for young teenagers and celebrities and it is definitely not for people who actually care about the news br br side note i'd really rather watch ktla however they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes they're still a bit dull though oh well i'll stick to nbc's today abc's good morning america is also okay as long as diane sawyer doesn't become way too serious
<START> this was the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen a lot of bad movies first of i'm from kansas this movie does not have a shred of truth in it at all its like they took btk name and made up the rest on top of that it looks like someone was like i've only got 20 bucks here take it and make a movie and oh yeah don't worry about researching btk at all just make up something seriously pure dookie no one should ever see this movie the slaughtering cows scenes and making his victims eat stuff and describing animal slaughter btk did none of these things but the movie does so for the love of god never see this god awful movie the made for tv ones are way better and way more accurate
<START> bad bad bad bad bad what else can i say kate jackson must have been desperate to direct may be she should go back to acting on second thought she was a bad actress to who would put money in to producing something this bad i like anti christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the odd scare but this one is just bad bad bad the acting by the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera the special effects if you can call them that where laughable i would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion you would see the tubes the blood shoots out of we had to turn the disc off after only 30 minutes this so called movies original prints should be destroyed all disc' and tapes destroyed and all the people associated with the making of the movie have to pay back money to the people that rented the movie then those people should never be allowed to act direct or film any thing but their own home movies
<START> i just saw this movie for the first time ever and i liked it her dancing was very entertaining i read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to dance the scenery was great too yvonne is such a talented woman and beautiful we laughed at the silly kissing scenes but that is what is great about old movies i grew up with her on the munsters and i am enjoying watching her in her earlier movies they may not all be the best out there but still worth watching to see her act and sing i am slowly purchasing all her movies and watching them as i receive them i have a large collection of her memorabilia
<START> i don't think i need to tell you the story for it has been told for years and years so i will just share my feelings i first saw cinderella was when i was five years old from then on i was a disney child in a good way the animation now seems childish and old fashioned but that is part of its charm now now in the age of high school musical and computer generated images it seems like people have forgotten the genius and magical essence of early disney movies thankfully i was born before that so i was introduced to this classic and it seems no matter how old i get i turn back into that five year old watching it on vhs which is the true magic of disney
<START> i just finished a marathon of this series and it became agonising to watch as it progressed from the fictionalising of the historical elements to o'herlihy's awful accent in later episodes the show just slumps the further it goes if you are looking for some low quality production generalised ww2 fluff then i could recommend season 1 but avoid anything after that it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility br br the old b w film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the colditz name attached to it and even that is not what one could hope for
<START> shall we dance a light hearted flick from japan tells of an overworked accountant and family man who is attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman he see's from the train during his daily commute what he finds in the studio are lessons in dancing and most of all himself funny poignant and utterly charming swd is an award winning film well worth a look by more mature viewers b
<START> whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the mst3k version you can only be impressed by the utter gall that went into this production the filmmakers insult the viewer's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldn't care less that they are doing so br br everything about it is rock bottom cheap even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyard br br the hobgoblins are as you probably know realized with badly crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys when a person is supposed to be attacked by them it's clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body when the critters scurry away from the two security guards this is shown or rather not shown by the camera aiming up at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past it's reminiscent of the scene in the film tangents where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world surveying the wreckage and we aren't shown any of it budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you won't have anything worth showing so why try the sets were utterly laughable club scum was an obvious diner the house appears to have been a vacant house probably for rent or sale which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot the spacecraft is something i would have been ashamed to build when i was a model making 10 year old br br the motivations of the characters make no sense kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he hasn't made her proud of him i'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end but any guy with real self respect would have told her to go to hell and left her nick is supposedly back from 2 months of army training yeah nice regulation haircut nick and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic moronic animals who are sex maniacs kyle is a phone sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex clad dominatrix type but he's so effeminate that he's more likely gay than not one of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleaze br br and the hobgoblins at the end they all head back to the vault where they've lived for 30 years why who knows who cares watch this film and be amazed at how primitive film making in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script incompetent direction actors who are so bad they'd be rejected from a high school theater production and sets worthy of edward d wood jr
<START> this is one of the movies of dev anand who gave great yet distinct movies to hindi movie industries such as jewel thief and guide the story is short if you ask me what is the story plot is simple a brother seeks for his lost sister sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant hare rama hare krishna yet the movie portrays few of the significant events that the world experienced in 70's hippie culture their submission to drugs freedom escaping duty family and adopting anything new such as eastern which was new for whites religion they have been handled perfectly zeenat gave her best and dev as usual was remarkable songs are the best used unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs in this movie they have not been spoiled one perfect example is 'dekho o deewano ram ka naam badnam na karo' each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful the end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie overall devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here a must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful nepal of 70's
<START> i remember when the golden child was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics and i m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of eddie murphy so i guess this movie has something going for it br br it gets off to a bad start where buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face bad guys enter the temple br br child sits with blank expression br br bad guys chop up the monks br br child sits with blank expression br br bad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with go on guess you do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at michael jackson s wonderland ranch he d still give the same blank expression this movie would be better titled the wooden child br br the title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening in fact that s the main problem and boy it s a serious one with this movie the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together i blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be it s part fantasy part martial arts part buddy movie part comedy and it s all crap
<START> alan alda plays real life sports illustrated writer george plimpton who was once invited to join the detroit lions football team as an honorary member rather wan uncompelling drama curiously tempered with fantasy director alex march takes an interesting tack on this material shooting it in a quasi documentary fashion with macho commentary and yet giving the tale a touch of capraesque whimsy still by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this set up he turns the main narrative into a jumble alda's smug uncharismatic performance is another handicap though the supporting cast is filled with real life pro athletes and scintillating lauren hutton as alda's girlfriend how's that for a fantasy 1 2 from
