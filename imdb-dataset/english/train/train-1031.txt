<START> i'd heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on dvd there was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we'd both heard that this was a terrifying film really scary how disappointed was i very apart from that one scene we all know which bit nothing happened i was expecting to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do a few more jumpy scenes like appear at the window or walk across the hall or something br br nearly all the reviews here say what a scary gripping atmospheric movie this is i just didn't see it i'm afraid maybe there's a difference in what people find scary in the us to here in britain br br a big let down after all the hyped reviews
<START> an obvious b grade effort to cash in on the hostel saw buzz my expectations for this film were low really low and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level the acting is so bad it's not even funny the plot line is non existent and the only scare was realizing that i had wasted 1hour 21 minutes watching it i'm surprised to note that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating i can only suspect that 33 of these are cast and crew the 34th is possibly the directors mother although i'm sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a 2 dvd extras include an hour long making of feature which raises the question why although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do avoid at all costs
<START> most of the french films i've seen and enjoyed were more talk than action but that's okay i found them interesting well photographed and with intriguing actors however i did at one point wonder if gerald depardieu was in every french film ever made it seemed that way br br this movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening but then it became talk talk and more talk which is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery after awhile i almost fell asleep watching this br br actually the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room thus if you love plays you should like this but i want a little more bang for a murder story
<START> remembering the dirty particulars of this insidiously vapid movie is akin to digging into your chest cavity with a rusty salted spoon perhaps home alone 2 lost in new york 1992 was a bit on the predictable side but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most shameless bids at commercialization i have ever heard of a boy fighting off spies terrorists when he's home alone in a chicago suburb with the chickenpox ridiculous why did this film have to be made i am the kind of person who believes even terrible movies are not wastes of time but rather learning experiences however this is actually a waste of time it should be avoided at all costs
<START> the movie starts with a nice song looks like a thriller with arbaaz khan walking around in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy with the routine stupid idiots like golmaal with tusshar sharman kunal and rajpal acting like grown up kids their scenes are quite funny first and then get boring there is a bored sub plot of tanushree's brother being killed towards the end the film tries to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets even stupid then a lengthy bashing bashing climax straight out of hera pheri and wait there is also a long chase in payal's house br br the film is so boring that it makes you fall asleep br br direction by priyan is very bad music pritam is routine except the first song br br cinematography is bad the film has a cheap look throughout br br rajpal yadav is good in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and i was happy that the actor isn't loud and over the top like other films but no he becomes his usual self and gets irritating most of the times tusshar should not speak in a film his dial delivery is terrible sharman is the saving grace he is the sole actor who acts very well in this film kunal khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult but doesn't impress much tanushree is bad as always arbaaz khan gets less scope and is usual payal is a non actress murli sharma is terrible
<START> i found this to be an utter waste of time effort and money i know disney always displays lack of creativity when making straight to video films but rehashing the plot of the original film with a new perspective is an all time low soon they'll just be re releasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a new version of the movie we all love nathan lane surprisingly returns to his role of timon yet again timon and pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original lion king embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it really happened as they see it br br of course timon is now the hero of the story yadda yadda yadda blah blah blah br br the musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap the vocal talents are impressive for a video feature but then again when was the last time you remember matthew broderick whoopi goldberg or nathan lane being in anything of real commercial substance overall if you liked the original you'll hate this it's insulting because it's unfair to children and adults alike and that about sums it up
<START> as a girl hinako moved away from her small village to tokyo leaving behind her two best friends fumiya and sayori she returns as a young woman surprised to find that sayori died when she was a teenager she reunites with fumiya and they are horrified to learn that sayori is mysteriously being resurrected via the island of shikoku oh boy i rented this because i like asian horror and i think chiaki kuriyama a nifty actress unfortunately if i had to describe shikoku in one word it would be fruity this movie is silly boring poorly filmed unimaginative and most of all unscary kuriyama has minimal screen time as the resurrected sayori and her character is given little to work with
<START> if my grandma did films they would probably do much better figure than this one incredible bad the main characters the mom the dad and son are ok specially the mother she's a nice actress and the kid also proves to be a nice one specially on the scenes where he is supposed to be scary but does the the director know the meaning of the words plot point triller and good script the script hasn't any evolving atmosphere to become a suspense thing if you like being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it otherwise just stay at home and sleep oh actually there was something funny the movie's from 2001 but we couldn't realize it since the image is so bad like on mini dv and the cars are so old like 70 and 80's
<START> there's been a vogue for the past few years for often as not ironic zombie related films as well as other media incarnations of the flesh eating resurrected dead fido is a film that's either an attempt to cash in on that simply a manifestation of it or both and it falls squarely into the category of ironic zombies the joke here is that we get to see the walking dead in the contrasting context of a broadly stereotyped squeaky clean alternate history we are in the wake of a great zombie war and the creatures are now being domesticated as slaves version of a 1950s suburb br br it's a moderately funny concept on its own and enough perhaps for a five minute comedy sketch but it can't hold up a feature film on its own the joke that rotting corpses for servants are incongruous with this idealized version of a small town is repeated over and over again and loses all effectiveness the soundtrack relentlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies cannibalize bystanders the word zombie is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiarly homey line for a cheap attempt at a laugh br br the very broadness and artificiality of the representation of the nineteen fifties here can't help but irritate me it is so stylized in it evidently pleasantville inspired way that it is more apparent in waving markers of its 1950s ness around than actually bearing any resemblance to anything that might have happened between 1950 and 1959 there is something obnoxiously sneering about it as if the film is bragging emptily and thoughtlessly about how more open down to earth and superior the 2000s are br br because the characters are such broad representations of pop culture 1950s types it's difficult to develop much emotional investment in them each has a few character traits thrown at him or her helen is obsessed with appearances and bill loves golf and his haunted by having had to kill his father but they remain quite two dimensional performances within the constraints of this bad writing are fine the best is billy connolly as fido the zombie who in the tradition of boris karloff in frankenstein actually imparts character and sympathy to a lumbering green monster who cannot speak br br there are little bits of unsubtle allegory thrown around to commodity fetishism racism classism war paranoia et cetera but none of it really works on a comprehensive level and the filmmakers don t really stick with anything br br unfortunately this film doesn't really get past sticking with the flimsy joke of look zombies in 'leave it to beaver ' for a good hour and a half
<START> i haven't yet read kurt vonnegut's mother night though i've read other books of his all outstanding pieces of satire and game changing novel pieces after seeing keith gordon's film adaptation of his book it will be an immediate must read in the near future it's the kind of material that i'm sure if it wasn't made in 1995 96 as a film it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post present holocaust ww2 movies are quite popular except that this is much darker though even more resonant about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say the reader it's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime which is what being a spy in ww2 is really all about br br it would be one thing if mother night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role even after the war ends for howard w cambpell nick nolte which is does but it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique keith gordon is not someone i usually think of as a director of really strong material more so i think back to him as an actor oddly enough featured briefly with vonnegut himself in back to school but this is a revelation he takes the story of campbell as a story of a fractured life a german propaganda master the only american left in berlin who is actually a spy for the americans but can never have his identity revealed and was before a playwright who really belonged to a nation of two himself and his wife sheryl lee it follows him from his prison cell awaiting trial in israel in 1961 as he writes his memoir and tells of his disillusionment about being a 'pretend' nazi and then in 1960 in semi hiding in a new york apartment which is where the bulk of the film takes place br br mother night can be quite heavy like on a level one might associate with the pianist but on another more emotional cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film gordon by way of vonnegut is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing except the memory and then later a weird transposition of his long lost love in a sister who has come back to him in nyc so he's left to his own devices when he befriends a painter alan arkin very very good here and then is found out as a nazi in hiding by a white supremacist newsletter leading wackos to his apartment on the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story but not a thing is straightforward the 'something' of this man's life is staggering but it's ultimately of his own choosing campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end but the same conclusions might be reached and in a way mirrors the line goebbels said the bigger the lie the more people believe it that is except for the select few who started the lie and know its secret and power br br but oh it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragic comic tale or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances which is does nolte is at his very best here and sheryl lee who we might remember from twin peaks as laura palmer stuns in multiple roles especially in the scene when she reveals she's not 'really' helga it's also a gorgeously shot film with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character or just the starkness or sickening colors of the time watch the scene where an old campbell watches a film of his younger self spouting out a rant the juxtaposition of faces is great and the music selections rise the level of tragedy it could be argued some of the music is too much but at other times it elevates the material past its own usual dramatic dimensions and makes it operatic solemn about human nature br br it's not always an easy film to take emotionally and some of the twists do have that tinge of whoa as in any spy story but it's the subversion from vonnegut that sticks through the way of taking appearance and performance of life imitating art imitating life imitating death and making it into something worth remembering i have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film or the other way around but at the moment it's hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post ww2 holocaust storytelling
<START> i never saw this when i was a kid so this was seen with fresh eyes i had never heard of it and rented it for my 5 year old daughter plus the idea of christopher walken singing and dancing made me curious the special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre but the story is great my daughter was entranced i loved watching walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him very amusing to see him dance and if the songs weren't great at least they weren't disney over produced saccharine sweetness the ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end but it was mostly benign interestingly we had recently read puss in boots and i had wondered about the implausibility of the story but while staying true to almost every aspect walken's acting made it believable great fun i'd watch it again with my daughter
<START> the robin cook novel coma had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in 1978 a couple of years later it was the turn of another robin cook bestseller to get the big screen treatment but in the case of sphinx virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong this is a dreadful adventure flick consisting of wooden performances stupid dialogue unconvincing characters and leaden pacing the only reason it escapes a 1 out of 10 rating is that the egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself hard to believe franklin j schaffner of patton and planet of the apes is the director behind this debacle br br pretty egyptologist erica baron lesley anne down is on a working vacation in cairo when she stumbles across the shop of antiques dealer abdu hamdi john gielgud hamdi befriends erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge consequently he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of pharoah seti i that he is keeping secretly in his shop the very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in erica for it could provide vital clues in locating seti i's long lost tomb a prize as great as the discovery of tutankhamun's tomb in 1922 before hamdi can tell erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop with erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen erica attempts to track down the treasure she finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties none of whom are truly trustworthy for one there is yvon maurice ronet seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives then there is akmed khazzan frank langella an egyptian for whom erica feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from her br br the biggest problems with sphinx generally result from its total disregard for plausibility down couldn't be less convincing as a female egyptologist Â one assumes she would be quite well educated and resourceful yet she spends the entire film screaming helplessly like some busty bimbo from a teen slasher flick on those rare occasions that she actually isn't running from a potential villain she does other brainless things such as taking polaroid flash photos in a 4 000 year old tomb the plot twists are heavy handed to say the least mainly comprising of revelations and double crosses that can be predicted well in advance one can't even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare because the pacing is awfully sluggish what little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium a famous review of the movie declared sphinx stinks never before has a 2 hour film been so aptly summed up in 2 words
<START> disappointing and irritating the screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clichÃ©s in a disjointed fashion character is not explored in depth these are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element the mother's affair with her daughter's lover br br anne reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye the script portrays darren daniel craig as a dr jekyll mr hyde without any hints about why except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene br br a mature writer could have done so much more with this topic

<START> tv does influence society just look at the surge in popularity of cappucino shops after this shallow little piece of work debuted besides real people who look as good as these people do don't have any problems br br besides does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a nice manhattan loft considering what they do for a living nbc just loves to insult the viewer's intelligence even if they're just around gump's level i know a person who makes 100 000 a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny one bedroom apartment in manhattan that costs 2200 a month in rent br br i'd like to see a show called phriends where it's six ugly nobodies in dead end jobs living in a crummy neighborhood where sirens constantly wail and someone gets mugged every week and then the landlord jacks up the rent now that i would watch
<START> being that i loved the original caligula even with all its flaws i have to say this remake trailer was abysmal br br listening to jovovich say in that lazy american accent mmm cuhligyooluh makes me feel sick the set doesn't look roman at all it looks like some rich actor's hollywood mansion backyard and the roman costumes look like cheap crap you buy at a suburban costume shop br br that charming adriana asti looks like a fifty year old hispanic woman totally terrified out of her mind as if not knowing it's a movie trailer br br the acting has got to be some of the worst i've ever seen with most of the lines i hear being random actors screaming caligulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa as loudly and obnoxiously annoyingly as they can br br the random sex scenes also filled a good 40 or 50 of the trailer and the scenes with notable actors actresses like gerard butler who graces the screen in shadows for all of three and a half seconds not doing anything but looking uncomfortable or going all out over the top with their minimal lines just dragging it down with the ridiculousness of their delivery br br courtney love's part consists of her looking like her usual dumpy crack whore self leaning against a door mumbling about the moon or something you can't tell because she's either drunk or high or just mumbling idiotically br br karen black is just annoying randomly laughing and screaming in such a way that irritates you br br helen mirren she was in the original and her return to caligula consists of caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaligulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa i particularly love and by love i mean hate ennia's line caligola j00 no maki me something incoherent something that sounds like j00nalo it's also insanely arrogant to say caligula's four year reign was greater than jesus's birth and death br br honestly this has got to be the worst most exploitative self indulgently arrogant piece of crap labeled as art i've ever seen even if gore vidal hated the original caligula he shouldn't have shown up or given his name over for this crap pile no matter how much they paid him unless it was a billion trillion yen worst trailer ever
<START> this movie should not be compared to the sting or other caper heist con game films what makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships deceit and trust it's also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale has mr mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy highly hugely recommended
<START> max had the v 8 trace wheels of fires last and only hero has a jet engine on the back of his car allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces as he rockets around the halfway desolate wasteland be amazed as mad max 2 aka the road warrior is dissected and spliced back together as a new movie albeit filmed in a lackluster manner with bad actors and lousy stunt work br br why is wof set in a post apocalyptic wasteland simple the road warrior was actually any questions can be answered by it was that way in the road warrior except for the out of work mutant actors from the original 60's the time machine film that make a cameo appearance for sake of giving the audience some non vehicular action to chew on for a few minutes br br in typical 80's fashion all cars driven by bad guys that are bumped or slightly jostled explode in a huge billowing explosion inevitably all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will unavoidably fall off of them along with this 80's cinematic wild ride is the general rampant misogyny in this style of cheapie film generally i waited for trace's rocket powered car to accelerate and shoot flames so there would be another shot of him scrunching up his face like he is supposed to be tough which comes off more as him looking constipated badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting makes this film a true sinker the unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin br br rats nights of terror by bruno mattei is superior and that in and of itself is saying a lot by this count 2020 texas gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to wheels of fire a poor road warrior knock off that doesn't have near enough cheese factor to make the film watchable br br
<START> this the direct to video death rattle of the tremors series features sixty inspired seconds sawblade you'll know it when you see it and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at tremors 4 was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget that means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm on human violence tops the lackluster cliche spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the tremors 4 experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long only hardcore tremors fans will be able to sit through much less enjoy this film if you aren't among them don't bother
<START> i have to say as being a fan of the man who created halloween the fog christine the thing probably his best films br br then you got this pos i can't logically think he put any effort at all into this like he did with cigarette burns at least his son made a decent soundtrack br br you have to look at this from the standpoint that it didn't seem like a movie it looked as if someone else directed it for one thing i won't believe carpenter put any effort into this at all br br i was just listening to his old school h2 h3 the fog soundtrack and it was awesome especially for the times br br he was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films
