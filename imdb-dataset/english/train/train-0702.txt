<START> this movie started out good i felt like i was watching an adult version of seinfeld much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing all the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny dan cortese was amazing i loved him in this role his agent should show this movie to casting agents watch the first few scenes and then find something better or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess i found this in a bin at a video store it cost me two dollars and due to the rareness of this movie i feel like it was a good price
<START> something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot the movie that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making the best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistake br br the editing is poor direction is crap acting is out of this world omg the characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes br br i wouldn't watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it
<START> watched this as a late tv movie last night purely by chance the blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey as i tuned in there's the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory played by daniel craig no less so the plot was immediately apparent br br it turns out that eponymous mother's carpenter love interest is also the daughter's boyfriend so there's trouble brewing and not too many surprises but i'd been caught by anne reid's compelling performance and i was hooked the direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and adjusting scarves when she exudes sadness br br the sex scenes were fascinating and taboo breaking shouldn't older women's bodies remain covered up not here and we're treated to a delicious reawakening in the mother's sexuality even more startling are the drawings she's made that spoiler once discovered confirm her daughter's suspicion that something's going on here br br cathryn bradshaw as the daughter didn't convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast but that could be me with her waves of pre raph locks i kept expecting to see julia sawahla whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my mind bradshaw has a rounder happier face that didn't carry the anger that emerges as the film progresses br br the ending is weak if the goodbyes for mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons whatever she's done she's a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years and i found the lack of sympathy jarring for a film so full of emotion and be warned it's like opening champagne you'll never get the lid back on the ending is a cold contradiction
<START> turned out to be another failed attempt by the laughable sci fi channel i am not sure who wrote the script and interpreted the poem but i am sure it was by some 17 year old teen who thought it would be awesome to a have a scoped crossbow in the movie aaaaaaah when i saw that part i lost all hope then they set off for heorot in a what looks to be the ship that christopher columbus sailed in when they reach heorot which is supposed to be a norse mead hall the sci fi group of idiots decided to make heorot look like a big stone castle when i saw that part i wanted to scream i really wanted this movie to be good but sci fi has yet to produce a good movie so i don't know why i got my hopes up oh and grendel and his mother are stupid also this comment is off topic about grendel if anyone from the sci fi channel is reading this here is some good advice not every movie you make has to be about a big monster that can rip people in half thats not what science fiction is about and also stop casting low grade actors like stephen baldwin to be in your films its not helping the movie but making it worse
<START> twenty five years ago i showed this film in some children's classes in entomology and can still remember the excitement of the kids they were spellbound it is not just about the termites who have built and live in the castles of clay but also about the other animals who use the mounds there is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a colony of mongooses watch it is a not only good for entomology classes but also for teaching about ecology since there is so much about the interactions between the termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all of the organisms that live in and around the mounds br br i wish it was available on dvd so that i could watch it again and show others
<START> this film is one of the best of all time certainly in the horror genre the claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be actors are fantastic rip donald pleasance you were fantastic as dr loomis he made the film even better without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient jamie lee curtis is also superb as our beloved scream queen her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house which of course is one of the films best scenes she gives a tremendous performance i loved this film since it scared me like hell back when i seen it in the very early 80's and i still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn the fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true we all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this death at any turn halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way horror should be believable and that is what makes the film enjoyable it's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere as well as psycho's superb storyline both of which i adore i believe there formats are the best horror has to offer to me halloween and psycho are the best films i have ever seen and i will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time
<START> every generation fully believes it is living in the end times this has been true for thousands of years now and movies like this feed on this how did they get the great orson welles to narrate this train wreck this is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of armageddon it tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made making it obviously dated and kind of silly br br the reenactments look like they are out of unsolved mysteries but without the high production values people should have been embarrassed to take part in this br br in short the movie is dated silly reactionary and useless good if you want a good laugh but not good enough to actually look for
<START> i'm sorry for jean after having such a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worst movie in is career this movie was shot down terribly by horrible acting jobs by goldbeg romeo and whatever that computers name was also some scenes may have been just a little unnesicary truly bad movie
<START> this film is so bad i can't believe it was actually shot people who voted 10 or 9 8 and even 7 are you insane did we really watch the same movie or the same sh should i say everything is bad in this film the story is there a story is going nowhere completely incoherent the acting some dialogs are simply just ridiculous the music score what the is that the editing and especially the artistic direction a pure disaster reminds me the old macist movies to give you an example of the amateurism of the production the mermaid's costume is a sleeping bag with spangles sticked on it i'm not joking that's exactly what it is br br another example of the enormous mistakes we find here you see in a scene an extra a fat woman of about 200 pounds who's talking on her cell phone the next shot which is in a complete different location you can see this same woman still talking on her cell phone yes it goes that far br br a big huge waste of money useless
<START> i first saw this movie when i was a little kid and fell in love with it at once the sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious you sons of a thousand fleas br br it is always shown on tv late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about 3 00 am once and it had just started tv companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine work br br 10 10
<START> this is a film that belongs firmly to the 50's very surprising that american film institute has chosen this one for one for the best 100 american movies of all time i have seen practically all of the movies on that list and this one is by far the most disappointing one of those musical numbers and there many many of them are very overlong and boring and have absolute no connection with the story the end of the movie has horribly over long ballet sequency which naturally has no real relation to the story of the movie it must be admitted that it is very well made the music is ok and the dancing done with the highest professional standard but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the movie br br the main character of the movie is extremely childlish and unlikeable and behaves in unpolite way his mental age is about 14 if you want to see a good musical made on the golden age of musicals go and see singing in the rain
<START> a young couple mandy pullman mitch martin and roy seeley matt birman are relaxing on a beach in the small town of galen they decide to start playing practical jokes on each other mandy hides in an old run down cabin she is attacked and raped by an unknown assailant roy tries to help her after hearing her screams but is killed dr sam cordell john cassavetes and his daughter jenny erin flannery are both new to galen after the death of sam's wife sam is called into action by police chief hank walden john ireland when mandy and roy are found he performs the autopsy on roy and treats mandy for her horrific injuries soon after a curator at the local museum named carolyn davis denise furgusson is also attacked and raped a local journalist named laura kincaid kerrie keane reports the events and suggests to sam that a similar string of rapes and murders occurred in the town 30 years earlier more rapes and murders occur meanwhile jenny's boyfriend tim galen duncan macintosh has been having strange dreams and nightmares and is convinced that he has something to do with the horrific acts tim's story and digging into the towns past makes sam become convinced of the existence of a creature known as an incubus a shape shifting demonic entity that exists only to reproduce directed by john hough this is one seriously dull horror film the script by george franklin based on the novel by ray russell is slow to say the least nothing interesting or exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending i've ever seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly as the story plods along at a snails pace there are a few rapes but none are shown on screen there is only one gore scene in the entire film too the monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes everything about this film production wise is very static and flat the film has no energy or pace the acting is dull and you don't feel or care for anyone check out the scene in the autopsy room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions the type of rubbish horror film making that you'll forget within a day a real waste of time don't bother
<START> the narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother the main character lin macadam played by james stewart represents justice and righteousness his brother who operates under the persona of dutch henry brown played by stephen mcnally stands for the classic stage coach robbing western outlaw chased by his brother for having killed their father the world the story takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter town and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western lawman wyat earp br br present as well are such flat characters typical of the western such as the murderous indian warrior the besieged cavalryman and the bonnet clad damsel in distress br br another important archetype in this film that which gives the film it's name is a custom made winchester rifle the weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably once it is stolen from its rightful owner it brings tragedy to everyone that comes in contact with it in this sense it resembles other such icons like the holy grail in raiders of the lost ark and the blood stained letter in saving private ryan this gives the film an element of surrealism which is usually absent from westerns a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols br br being essentially a revenge film it shares this element with many other examples of the genre such as jack arnold's no name on the bullet and clint eastwood's unforgiven br br there is also a tacit theme of rape in winchester '73 waco johnny dean one of the film's villains played very effectively by dan duryea abducts a woman after killing her husband the volatile cowboy toys with the tenderfoot husband and dispatches him like a caricature of a cat toying with an insect before biting its head off waco johnny dean eventually gets what is coming to him after coming in contact with the ominous winchester rifle br br the main story of winchester '73 is reminiscent of the mythological tale of jason and his quest for the golden fleece as told in apollonius' argonautica both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object that possesses some sort of intangible quality like jason stewart's character hops from one adventure to the next in search of a one of a kind prize another theme in winchester '73 that is similar to a mythic tale is the struggle between brothers several stories of antiquity deal with this issue such as the hebrew bible's tale of cain and abel and the vulgate tale of romulus and remus br br as for the theme of abduction and rape present in anthony mann's film it is present in many mythological works such as the rape of europa as told by ovid in his metamorphoses br br winchester '73 is a fine example of the western genre and acts as the objective correlative for many classic american western and ancient mythological themes
<START> somewhere between the food court and zip's the mall in this film br br has an explosives store this is the only place the title character br br can purchase the bomb he plants in the mall in the dull finale br br a fictional town has a new mall built on some land that was br br condemned cute girl i didn't catch her name gets a job as a br br waitress there she lost her boyfriend in a fire at the site where the br br mall stands the villainous mall owner hires the arsonist br br responsible for the fire as a security guard after his first security br br guard ends up dead rob estes eons before silk stalkings is a br br photog reporter trying to find a story he hooks up with cute girl br br and their mutual funny friend pauly shore and try to find out if eric br br is still alive he is living in the mall basement and traveling br br through the air ducts and offing different people who upset his br br former girlfriend including the arsonist eventually he kidnaps her br br and the finale involves the bomb and everyone running from the br br scene before the big kablooey morgan fairchild is along for the br br ride as the mayor yes she's the mayor br br of course you probably did not need a plot sketch since the entire br br story is in the title someone named eric is taking revenge against br br people as a phantom of a mall this also means there is no br br suspense we know eric is behind this but we still have to see br br estes and cute girl go through the motions of a silly investigation br br watch as fairchild who we know has been in cahoots with the br br mall owner all along pull a gun on our heroic duo in the middle of br br a crowded party yet no one says a word as she leads them to her br br office and her eventual death the fictional town is huge yet nary a br br policeman is ever called everyone relies on mall security for order br br eric has been hiding since the mall was built but i am not sure br br where he seems to live in a basement area but you would think br br some construction worker would have found him he also has br br furnished his love pad quite well and found a few outlets since he br br has electricity it might be nicer than your own apartment br br pauly shore fans both of you take note he tricks a security guard br br out of his booth by mooning the camera yes stop scanning br br celebrity skin and playgirl this is where you get to see a grainy br br black and white shot of pauly's south shore although no weezil br br this is just junk and proof positive that i am down to renting just br br about anything at the video store to stay in the horror section this br br film is not eric's revenge it is the film maker's revenge for me br br being dumb enough to watch it here is my revenge i do not br br recommend it that'll show 'em br br this is rated r for physical violence some gun violence gore br br some profanity some female nudity brief male nudity and some br br sexual content
<START> this typically melodramatic bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of western critics the script is ludicrous the acting is over the top and it looks cheesy the only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary meena kumari watching the actress who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released has the same fascination as watching a train wreck her ex husband amrohi wrote and directed but lacks the competency to execute either task well bollywood has produced far better films
<START> hollywood north is a satirical look at the time in canadian film history when the canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made in canada most of the time it was treated as a tax shelter or a cheap way to get american films made for example porky's came out of it anyways matthew modine plays a novice producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved canadian novel however in order to get the money he needs a american name star he gets a loose cannon and learns he has to compromise to the point where the film no longer resembles the book it was originally based on it plays well in canada but may not be understood outside of the great white north americans will think we're satirizing ourselves but will miss the point that we're actually satirizing them for canadians 8 10 for the rest of the world 5 10
<START> life's going not to badly for harry mitchell he's an ex air force major plus nifty little pension i imagine who's raking in the cash for a patent he's developed fusing titanium and steel via explosive process creating super metal fit for nasa and his wife of twenty odd years has kept herself in pretty good nick he's got a nice little pad in la i like to see visions of the 80s consumer dream and you get a good slice here what with the restored silver jag a series 1 e type roadster for him and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her as well as i'm sure other trinkets and boys toys there's always got to be more though hasn't there so harry let's himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans you're only as old as the woman you're feeling as in many films noir one mistake in an otherwise blotch less life leads to a downwards arc for harry br br three blackmailers leech onto him these are where the value are for me great character actors playing very believable roles bobby shy played by clarence williams iii is a black ex con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double crossers he's reminiscent of pluto the vicious black ex con psychopath from carl franklin's well regarded neo noir one false move 1992 there's a similar character motivation i believe both men have had enough of the man and well pretty much everyone in extremis robert trebor plays leo franks a fat lily livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at 25 for half an hour and 50 for a whole hour did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount he's in over his head and it's great to watch trebor acting when leo starts to feel the heat believable breakdown john glover wins as alan raimy who is the brains of the plot an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui he's a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie including what i believe is a pretty well implied rape pay attention to his rap sheet readout it's easily missed and read between the lines for the motel scene with slim br br in common with one false move though not exclusively i think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence br br so far so good but i think there's a real problem with the film harry mitchell is told at one point that he has his tit in the wringer my problem is that harry mitchell is played by roy scheider roy scheider protagonists never lose they're self sure and smooth but not in an annoying way i feel i'm being asked to believe that his character is in peril the movie relies on this for dramatic tension however i didn't believe it for me it's like being asked to believe that sandra bullock's character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama or stephen seagal's character is going to get taken down by the baddies did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value roy scheider doesn't convince as an adulterer either you don't feel any annoyance with him at all his character is teflon coated br br it also felt like a movie that took some cuts at 110 minutes it still feels underdeveloped harry's wife ann margaret is pretty much a cardboard cutout an extension of harry her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention the effect that the affair has on harry's marriage isn't properly communicated this could be a frankenheimer problem he's not known for character development i never felt that harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the irs br br there is good sleazy violent noir content in this film but i feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of harry could have been done better no disrespect to the great roy scheider the film felt short even with the long running time and i think could have taken some more fleshing out br br but you really can't forget the sleaze like the deliciously pervy scene of harry taking photos of doreen in the nudie parlour
<START> orca is not exactly bad but it's not really richard harris's finest hour either as a demented ahab like fisherman harris gets into a game of death with a vengeful killer whale after killing the whale's wife and unborn child charlotte rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with harris she yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone he doesn't listen and somehow ends up in the arctic battling the revenge crazed whale there are no special effects to speak of except for what looks like a round mirror for a whale's eye there are endless shots of harris reflected in the eye so the audience understands that the whale knows who he is bo derek as one of harris's crew has a particularly unpleasant run in with the orca and most of the supporting cast including robert carridine will sampson and keenan wynn don't fare very well either
<START> if any style of film could be called my guilty pleasure it'd be this generic fantasy type guilty is the wrong word for it though as i'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time stardust is good stock fantasy the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman or gaiman adaptation as it were it isn't the visual dream scape of mirrormask it isn't the adult pretension of pan's labyrinth and it isn't the fun loving classic the princess bride but it contains just what the fantasy lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing fantasy lovers should rejoice special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now br br the story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star to make things difficult however tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine and he's not the only one looking for her some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star's heart can give and a brother's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction br br from there it's all pretty predictable but it involves some attractive fantasy elements some warm hearted commentary on the nature of love and the best part robert deniro as a gay pirate on that note deniro's performance is spot on it's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough and gruff typecast character thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching deniro's own opening up into alternate forms of acting deniro hasn't been so unique to his own image since brazil and that's saying something br br stardust is the type of movie perhaps that will subsist on children's and fantasy lover's shelves for a long time i can't say it offers anything new but it's not really there to it's actually those most familiar with it's tropes that will enjoy it the most br br polarisdib
<START> i give this movie an a for the sheer camp of it as dietrich's daughter maria riva wrote in the book on her mother if one sees the garden of allah in the context of high camp it can be very amusing and how i laughed with delight at the overwrought score and the astoundingly ridiculously fantastically melodramatic dialogue viewers who've read the accounts of boyer's toupee it kept coming unstuck in the heat will snicker every time it makes an appearance br br dietrich and boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines instead they gaze dreamily off into the distance presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light if you're starring in a turkey might as well look good dietrich's costumes are out of this world as riva notes in her book dietrich managed to steal paramount's travis banton and have him design some of the most divine gowns such as the chiffon beige dress cape br br i heartily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the technicolor it really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936 the color is fantastic br br in short if you watch the garden of allah with a lenient attitude and embrace its silliness you can't help but enjoy it
