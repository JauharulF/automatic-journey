<START> thank god abc picked this up instead of fox the best description for those in the know is really wonderfalls meets dead like me in the best way possible br br i'm not sure whether an experience with death and destiny early in life makes me a fan of brian fuller but i certainly enjoy his productions i also enjoy checkered floors pies talking toys gravelings and other mischievous items while a bit burtonesque i certainly think this enjoys its own niche that doesn't require j depp or hb carter to be a wonderfully imaginative playground here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood crashing into each and actually making sense and making us want to live life to the fullest
<START> too bad i really like kristen cloke and gary busey but the director failed to put this together there's a lot of action a lot of promise but it all comes off hokey the director didn't do his job promising action comes off lame so much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film this version of the rage directv credits it as 1996 simply isn't worth the time to watch it another director would have done a better job
<START> by the time this film was released i had seen chorus line on stage 4 times and had been anticipating most eagerly the long rumored production of a film of the story my wife and i were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released it was not just a disappointment it was a kick in the abdomen br br first the story was moved outside so to speak by including scenes not in the confines of the theater those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story br br second third together assign your own order one of the original songs with very dynamic dance number was removed a song which was not in the stage production was added say what i'm confused br br the only reason i gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers i've now seen chorus line on stage 6 times and wouldn't mind seeing it 6 more times before i die it is superbly written with wonderful music and heart wrenchingly true stories if you want to see a musical which includes a great cattle call audition i recommend all that jazz if you want to see the story of a chorus line see it on stage
<START> what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me
<START> david webb peoples meets paul anderson if it already sounds weird to you then you are right because it is br br peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong the value of life etc he covered these issues in bladerunner unforgiven and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines br br paul anderson's first successful movie was a violent thriller not surprisingly so have all of his other movies and here is a violent thriller with moral implications br br peoples' script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie soldiers trained from birth taught to kill and never had a normal life they are replaced by better genetically engineered soldiers and todd one of the original soldiers is left on a planet and left for dead there he must cope with a group of refugees some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here but then br br the bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people big violent loud action ensues and peoples' script turns into an anderson action fest it is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way but the end product is better then i expected entertaining somewhat though admittedly not very thought provoking and exciting once the action starts 7 10 br br rated r a lot of violence
<START> i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the 1930s in this beautiful film the story is simple an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children the faces of the actors are marvelous to see the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine which was more sophisticated and intricate the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism humanity and history portrayed
<START> this movie reminded me that some old black white movies are definitely worth the look br br initially i had some reservations however from the beginning of the movie until the end i was captivated i was very impressed with the mixture of drama suspense comedy br br arthur askey tommy gander is hilarious and had me in stitches the whole time br br definitely add this movie to your movie night for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and too powerful or overly funny movies of today
<START> unfortunately this has been showing on star movies here in thailand for the last week or so it's complete rubbish acting as another member said this movie is a good example of 'how not to act ' i haven't seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time the actors can you call them 'actors' are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog i would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is you would have to see the movie but that would be akin to torture br br i cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines and the rest of the cast with their accents fake or contrived is equally heinous another actress with the fake british accent was pretty yes but good lord was her accent terrible mix that with her lack of acting and you have a disaster she should just have said nothing and i could have accepted her as the pretty girl oh my we just got to the scene where the leading lady's lover says really me after a forced crying scene from her laughable no really i just laughed out loud br br the sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the film some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are rather nice minus the actors br br the old magic potion lady what another member mentioned the 'modern' love song that was in the movie totally inappropriate for a period piece set some 500 years ago br br i understand the movie was considered 'big budget' in thailand at the time of it's production i would be seriously upset if i were the producer of this movie just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good or even mediocre film br br i would give the king maker a 1 out of 10 but the costumes and sets make save the film from such a rating 2 out of 10
<START> one of the things that interested me most about this film is the way the characters and their associated histories are developed on the fly i suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not force feeding their characters the premise of using the art and craft of furniture design and construction was a unique theme and or analogy for what families siblings go through in life the complexity of having a twin serve as a surrogate father and even husband added great tension towards making this film emotionally interesting also although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to i e jewish twins family business the themes are fairly universal as every family has a black sheep in it that made it very engaging
<START> unfortunately one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate clichÃ©d screenplay hollow man is a rather useless film br br practically everything seen here has been done to death the characters the idea and the action sequences especially the lift shaft with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects however it is just the same special effect done over and over again and by the end of the film that has been done to death also i was hoping before watching hollow man that the invisible man theme which is hardly original in itself would be the basis of something newer and more interesting this is not so it isn't long before the film turns into an overly familiar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics the mound of clichÃ©s piles up so fast that it's almost impressive br br on top of all this kevin bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best good points might be a passable jerry goldsmith score but no competition for his better efforts a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects i was tempted to give this film three out of ten but the effects push hollow man's merit up one notch br br 4 10
<START> this movie was almost intolerable to sit through i can get beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this movie is supposed to span over weeks in time yet the characters do not once change outfits but the acting broke the 4th wall to pieces for me i've seen better acting in a 4th grade play aside from that the plot is unrealistic if the man suspected the guy he would have turned him in i was also heavily disappointed that all the killings were done with a gun what kind of gore is that that is not a copycat the zodiac did not kill using just a gun the authorities would have known it wasn't him another thing that really bothered me was that they called disassociative identity disorder dsm 4 when that is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders not the name of the disorder overall i think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget at least not as low as they had or they could have made sure they had better actors or more gore plenty of people have went the low budget route with out having to use horrible actors look at easy rider that had dennis hopper and jack nicholson and a low budget
<START> i think part of the reason this movie was made and is aimed at us gamers who actually play all the nancy drew pc games there's been a lot of movies lately based on video games and i think this in one of them br br so this movie does not follow any book but it does follow parts of the games i buy and play every nancy drew games as soon as it comes out and the games are from herinteractive and are for girls who aren't afraid of a mouse and some of these games actually won parents' choice gold awards they are not only fun but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing br br i took two of my step children with me to go see it and they loved it the 10 yr old had started playing her first nancy drew game a day before i took her to see the movie and she was having so much fun playing the game i thought she would enjoy the movie as well and i was right she not only loved this movie but couldn't wait to get home to finish her first game and start another one br br my other step daughter is only 7 and she also loved the movie but she is still a little to young too play the games yet but she enjoys watching her sister play at times just to see what's going on br br the games are based for children 10 yrs and older all the games usually get pretty descent reviews and are classified as adventure games for more information on the games just check out herinterative nancy drew games so personally i thought the movie was pretty good and i will buy it when it comes out on dvd
<START> i had the privilege to see this movie at the intenational film festival of rotterdam br br 'xizhao' or 'shower' is a 200 000 lowbudget movie about a father and his 2 sons the father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional chinese village where local mostly aged men come to relax and to go bathing the father has to sons a 'retarded' son who lives with him and a son who lives in a big modern city and who comes to visit him to this son the traditional village the bathhouse and his 'retarded' brother seem strange and annoying but this changes along the movie br br though the story may sound cheesy or cliche it's not with really great performances especially of the father and the 'retarded' son sorry i don't know their names and a great story the movie was touching and funny at the same time br br if you got a chance to see this movie do it it's a great alternative to mainstream hollywood cinema br br
<START> some moron who read or saw some reference to angels coming to earth decided to disregard what he'd heard about the offspring of humans and angels being larger than normal humans reinventing them as mythical giants that were 40 feet tall is beyond ridiculous there was some historical references to housing and furniture in parts of the world that were much larger than would be needed for standard humans these were supposedly built on a scale that would lend itself to a 10 to 14 foot human somewhat supporting the david and goliath tale from the bible there is no mention in any historical references to buildings or artifacts that would support the idea of a 40 foot tall being if i was rating this movie on my own scale it would have been a negative value instead of a one
<START> ummm please forgive me but weren't more than half the characters missing in the original novel valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then attempting several times to escape he breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by the police inspector javert along the way there are many characters that weren't in this version some worth mentioning would be fantine cosette m mme thenardier eponine marius gavroche and enjolras the only character with the same name is javert i was confused and frustrated throughout the whole movie trying to see how it was in any way connected to victor hugo's epic novel
<START> i heard and read many praising things about midnight meat train which is based on a short story written by no less than clive barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original hellraiser that he directed himself but so far i can only express very mixed sentiments about my viewing experience the most appropriate term to summarize the whole film in just word is nauseating the violence is sadistic and extreme which undoubtedly attracts fanatic young horror enthusiasts but it's also indescribably gratuitous and exploitative normally speaking i'm very pro violence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose the butchering Â literally Â depicted in midnight meat train is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset stomachs and even that isn't fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects there are more shortcomings some even bigger than the pointless gore but perhaps i should focus on the good elements first the basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences like the chase in the freezer room for example are literally oozing with nail biting suspense and macabre atmosphere unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted presumably the processing of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing irregularities but i honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by vinnie jones the plot introduces leon an aspiring photographer in new york whose agent advises to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introvert and suspiciously behaving butcher who always awaits the midnight train leon's right as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally crushes his victims with a big hammer but the killer's motivations and behavior suggest there's something far more substantial going on the rails at night midnight meat train takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal abattoirs plus the film also benefices of good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images like cadavers on meat hooks and train carriages smeared in blood but director ryÃ»hei kitamura versus godzilla final wars doesn't take full advantage of it all the ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and even if clive barker meant to have like this i still think we deserved a slightly more clarifying finale midnight meat train is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film but not without defaults it's not intended for easily offended viewers but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well
<START> another entry in the holiday horror category that fills the shelves of your local video store the spoiler wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool' kids who wronged him plot will of course be familiar to those who've watched it before and those who've seen it before will probably watch it again those who are expecting ingmar bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it marilyn manson on the soundtrack and david boreanaz denise richards and katherine heigl as eye candy go with the flow and enjoy it oh and i loved the creepy mask
<START> in my lit class we've just finished the book hatchet and this movie is nothing like the book 1 brian never ate worms in the book 2 he didn't know the pilot's name 3 his mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see 4 the man the mother is cheating with doesn't have black hair he has blonde br br now for the unrealistic parts of the movie 1 a thirteen year old can't punch his fist through a window in one punch br br and for the acting the kid who played brian was a horrible actor br br however i do believe that the scenery was impressive though i highly doubt the director even read the book br br this movie is good if you have not read the book hatchet by gary paulsen but if you have then begin a complaint letter to the director
<START> a series of random seemingly insignificant thefts at her sister's boarding house has miss lemon quite agitated a ring light bulbs a rucksack a lighter a stethoscope a shoe Â there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it miss lemon asks her employer the great belgian detective hercule poirot to look into the matter but what poirot sees is something far more sinister than miss lemon could have imagined and poirot's fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered it's up to poirot to bring a killer to justice br br hickory dickory dock is a solid but not spectacular entry in the long running poirot series i appreciate how faithful the script is to agatha christie's original story i realize that certain liberties had to be taken but i appreciate the effort nonetheless the major points of the mystery are all there Â the petty thefts the boarding house the students the ripped rucksack and of course poirot's ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens with a few exceptions the cast of students is almost as i pictured them damian lewis and jessica lloyd standout among the group as mush as i always enjoy david suchet's poirot i get a real kick out of the episodes with phillip jackson's inspector japp and pauline moran's miss lemon this episode is a real treat as miss lemon gets more screen time than usual finally i enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel it's a fun little play on the hickory dickory dock title br br i realized while re watching hickory dickory dock just what a tremendous influence agatha christie's work was on the highly stylized italian mystery films or gialli of the 60s and 70s take the murder of mrs nicoletis as an example if you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene you would have something straight out of an early 70s giallo in fact the entire plot of hickory dickory dock could have been used in a giallo it's just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked
<START> this is one of the greatest child pet movies ever created i cry every time i see shadow yelling wait wait for me peter as the family car is pulling away this is a must see if you love animals best movie ever the lines in the movie are sometimes stupid like when sassy says to chance cat's rule and dogs drool lines like this i could do without but when i was six i bet i loved that line the storyline may seem hooky to some but i like it shadow as the older dog who's preparing chance to take over for him when he's gone is really moving when you think about it it reminded me of my childhood dog i think everyone can find a piece of themselves in homeward bound
