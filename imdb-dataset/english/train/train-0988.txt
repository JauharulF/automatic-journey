<START> this movie is an extremely funny and heartwarming story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble when the director goes on vacation his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things br br this is positively the best work that leslie nielson has ever done his idea in the film to rent out children is immediately innovative and his sales techniques will definitely make you laugh br br the little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that i know i will never forget her just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie br br such great family entertainment is so rare these days if you go for slightly corny pictures with happy endings go for this one i could watch this over and over and i often do my only complaint about this movie is that it is so difficult to find a copy
<START> collusion course is even worse than the typical evil white male corporate capitalist movie of the week this movie is less pleasant than a toothache jay leno can act he's good in his underrated debut movie the silverbears in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character this movie is so bad leno's character a sanctimonious buffoon is less annoying than morita's character a sanctimonious fool
<START> 1st watched 12 6 2009 4 out of 10 dir walter lang disappointing musical from a character development standpoint in my opinion from this much heralded rodgers and hammerstein piece there a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal at times of the king of siam by yul brynner but the movie doesn't really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings i can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we don't fully understand the character's and their situations i know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing but even this part didn't stand out a lot for me the basic storyline is about an english woman coming to siam to teach the children about upscale european things we find out later that the king is actually the biggest pupil there is a side forbidden romance between the king's newest wife played by rita moreno a latino as an arab come on and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though deborah kerr as the main female character annie is ok but not that convincing either the king learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does this is really a miniscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really
<START> steve martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy he absolutely does not fit this part like the woeful remake of the out of towners this movie falls flat on it's face how anybody ever thought steve martin could even come close to jack lemmon's wonderful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie dan ackroyd could have played the bilko part better martin is great when doing his own original characters but fails miserably trying to recreate other people's classic work it's a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the movie is over the line the producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the united states army was just about the only line that actually made me laugh if you want to see the real bilko get hold of the original episodes of the phil silvers show those are guaranteed to make you laugh unlike this mistake that should never have happened i put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned lemmon classic and the remake of psycho none of them should ever have happened
<START> it's 1978 and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well fans will be upset and certainly the 75 000 seats will be full only less happy there are so many black players on the field this made for tv super bowl movie is watchable it's not much more but it's really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance for the time probably most notably tom selleck unfortunately any goodness selleck brings to the screen is quickly trumped by actors like dick butkus br br it's a silly story about super bowl betting pj jackson is charged by new york read mafia for ensuring the game ends for their favor in this case a 10 000 000 bet pj is innocent enough and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there but things seem to fall apart for him another person the unsuspected lainie takes charge for a while the mystery of murders isn't known for certain but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that lainie is the new antagonist br br it's a bad movie but is watchable the acting is decent and the filming is ok at least there weren't any silly typical 70s car chases they have their place just not here just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you'll survive br br 2 10 maybe a 2 5
<START> just saw the world preem of fido at the toronto international film festival and thoroughly enjoyed it here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been pioneered certainly 'fleshed out' extensively and successfully by george romero but this is a canadian film by a canadian director and it's a comedy and yes i actually think it is better than 'shawn of the dead' thoroughly believable and perhaps even more importantly enjoyable performances by dylan baker carrie anne moss and young actor k'sun ray whom i suspect we'll be seeing a lot more of in future features however i must confess that i most enjoyed the delicious turn by tim blake nelson as neighbour mr theopolis essentially playing a willing animated version of victor van dort from the corpse bride or for those who've seen the film wouldn't that read even better here as the corpse pride and of course scotch actor billy connolly in his least animated yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character just think he would not have gotten this role had it not been for peter stormare's commitments to prison break as was revealed in the q a following thursday night's screening i can't help but speculate that the screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from day of the dead's zombie 'bub' i am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a comment and i won't start now suffice it to say that fido is not one of those dour graphically gory zombie films you can rely on from romero rather it is a film that will have you constantly chuckling and although and i did have to think back carefully to be sure there is a fair dose of blood letting and violence the delectable humour so well enhanced by the surreal milieu created by director currie and his co screenwriters goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated pg 13 i urge you to go see this little canuck gem i'll certainly be buying the dvd once it emerges hopefully by next summer
<START> well this film has certainly had a fair amount of hype from the buzz at the toronto film festival to gushing reviews on cbc radio a refreshing wacky hilarious indie movie apparently i'd been looking forward to it for months br br how can i put it this simply it sucked in a very big way an exercise in cinematic lameness that makes adam sandler look like a comic genius br br at best it was mildly amusing and at worst coma inducing an amerterish script badly directed and shoddily edited into a ramshackle mess br br and what was with the music being 500db louder than the rest of the sound track that was about the only truly odd thing about it br br if you want to see a genuinely funny bizarre movie involving aliens then try repoman there is no comparison
<START> i love seth green his appearances on that 70s' show is always worth watching but last night i felt the show needed to overhauled four single young guys inherit a new york city apartment that most of us would die for the grandmother must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place so i felt the need for realism should have been brought out anyway the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable i would have been thrilled if they had to move in with one of their parents which would have provided great humor and dysfunctional about the show's set up there did not seem to be much humor in it i am only watching it because it falls before my name is earl on a winning thursday night i think they should go back scrap this series and start over we need more family involved series how about seth and his friends move in with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place down they could have dabney coleman play the father and christine estabrook play the mother and dysfunctional siblings the list of possibilities with somebody like seth green are endless and the network is blowing it
<START> back in the 1970s wpix ran the adventures of superman every weekday afternoon for quite a few years every once in a while we'd get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air superman and the mole men i always looked forward to those days watching it recently i was surprised at just how bad it really was br br it wasn't bad because of the special effects or lack thereof true george reeves' superman costume was pretty bad the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible and true the mole men's costumes were even worse what was supposed to be a furry covering wouldn't have fooled a ten year old since the zippers sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious but these were forgivable shortcomings br br no what made it bad were the contrived plot devices time and again superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating a lynch mob is searching for the creatures rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to lois and the pr man the creatures are cornered again he stands around watching and talking but doesn't save them until they're shot luke benson the town's rabble rouser shoots at him attempted murder to any reasonable person but superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud but never once took advantage of them br br that said both george reeves and phyllis coates played their characters well seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles if only they had been given a better script to work with
<START> two years ago i watched the matador in cinema and i loved everything about this movie obviously i was totally under impression of pierce brosan's magnificent role yesterday i caught this movie again on tv so i looked at it a bit deeper now i can say with certain that this movie isn't that special but you just gotta' love it because of one man br br brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of julian noble tired hit man who has no friends soon julian meets danny wright greg kinnear in mexico city man who's got bad luck his son died in accident his job isn't going that well and he's not sure that he can keep his wife bean hope davis br br i always liked movies like this crime movie with big touch of humor mostly that humor comes from brosnan as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d or one of my favorite lines in this movie i look like a bangkok hooker on a sunday morning after the navy's left town brosnan says it with his charm while he's drinking his margarita as usually i also like greg 'typical american face' kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like danny wright br br so i recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of brosnan ever he'll make you smile and admire him at the same time great brosnan in not equally great movie
<START> after dipping his toes in the giallo pool with the masterful film the strange vice of mrs wardh 1971 director sergio martino followed up that same year with what turns out to be another twisty suspense thriller the case of the scorpion's tail like his earlier effort this one stars handsome macho dude george hilton who would go on to star in martino's satanic giallo hybrid all the colors of the dark the following year scorpion's tail also features the actors luigi pistilli and anita strindberg who would go on to portray an unhappy couple to put it mildly in martino's your vice is a locked room and only i have the key 1972 i just love that title i suppose edwige fenech was busy the month they shot this anyway this film boasts the stylish direction that martino fans would expect as well as a twisty plot some finely done murder set pieces and beautiful athenian location shooting the story this time concerns an insurance investigator hilton and a journalist strindberg here looking like farrah fawcett's prettier smarter sister who become embroiled in a series of grisly murders following a plane crash and the inheritance of 1 million by a beautiful widow i really thought i had this picture figured out halfway through but i was dead wrong although the plot does make perfect sense in this giallo i may have to watch the film again to fully appreciate all its subtleties highlights of the picture for me were anita's cat and mouse struggle with the killer at the end a particularly suspenseful house break in and a nifty fight atop a tiled roof lots of good action bursts in this movie the fine folks at no shame are to be thanked for still another great looking dvd with nice subtitling and interesting extras whotta great outfit it's turned out to be in its ongoing quest to bring these lost italian gems back from oblivion
<START> may contain minor spoilers br br dressed to kill having just seen it for the first time the other day is a movie with some terrific sequences some decent performances and a nice though obvious hitchcock ripoff plot twist at the end it's just too bad certain things quite obvious prevent it from being a classic br br dressed to kill deals with a mystery of a killer who has slain at least two women could have been more but the movie never tells us and the search for the killer by three people a brainy kid whose mom was a victim a lively hooker whose the only one who can identify the killer and a psychiatrist whose patient was the slained brainy kid's mother there are a host of well done performances including nancy allen as the hooker liz angie dickenson as the sexually frustrated victim kate miller and micheal caine as doctor rober elliot whose has more hidden than meets the eye though by no standard is anyone really outstanding on the other hand denis franz later to be a great character along the same lines on the hit show nypd blue is embarrassing as an over exaggerated ruthless hateful detective though he takes little screen time so it doesn't hurt the movie that much keith gordon the brain child is decent but is almost too smart to really be believable br br what sticks with me the most in the film are the tense sequences the scene with the sexually frustrated mother at the museum is gripping and well done as is the later sequence leading to her untimely death i also love the sequence at the doctor's office that reveals the identity of the killer which really makes the whole film come together at once and there's a split screen scene that i thought was almost classic still there's another situation when liz is on a train running from what may be the killer that gets taken in directions it should never had with almost embarrassing racial stereotypes as a thriller it's tense and quite often believable as a crime drama it often falters especially with the incomplete ridiculous explanation of everything that happened in the end there's also a needless and way too long dream sequence at the end in which they had the audacity to shoot someone's foot for what seemed minutes at a time this was an up and down experience one scene would catch me by the heart and mind with enticement and the next would make me squirm and ask why at more than 100 minutes this could have been under 90 and been a better film br br scary movie fans should like this it still stands as a better film than most of today's slasher flicks maybe it was a better film in it's time but having just seen it recently i can say i enjoy it and it is worth watching for my three favorite scenes alone
<START> pros nothing br br cons everything br br plot summary a female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies br br review never in my life have i come across a movie as bad the zombie chronicles filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks tzc is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame forgetable actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore that's more gross than frightening how does a movie like this even get made simply put avoid tzc like a sexually transmitted disease br br my last 2 cents humorously enough this movie was made by a movie company called brain damage films they're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this br br my rating 1 out of 10 if it were up to me this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion
<START> may and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren the visit is awkward because the grandchildren and kids don't really seem to know each other as one might expect the warmth that should be there is missing after dinner may's husband says he doesn't feel well blames it on his daughter's cooking and irritably says he wants to go home he dies that night br br may now a widow is lost she clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one but she had a purpose she had someone who needed her and even though her own needs had gone unmet for years she had something to do with her days br br she is depressed and unmotivated she goes to stay with her daughter paula who shortly after her mother's arrival lets her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all she lets loose with anger over her mother's lack of nurturing may seems disarmed and surprised yet she also doesn't seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right i'm your mother and i love you what does really say i've heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means paula is a bit well more than a bit neurotic both women are needy though they show it very differently br br paula has been involved with a friend of her son's darren who is a handyman working on the house owned by her son while paula is working during the day may begins to have conversations and lunches with darren darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their autistic son nicky but supposedly doesn't live in the home with his wife br br may becomes attracted to darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they seem to have darren becomes attracted to may because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life he also becomes too interested in money that may says she can give him to get away from it all though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey they end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day and may enjoys fulfillment as a woman that she has not known in years nor had ever expected to know again as her daughter paula had often told her that she would leave the married darren this becomes part of may's rationalization that what she is doing is okay br br at a writing group that paula leads may is introduced rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted there is one scene where she has sex with the older man who clearly can barely perform and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on may's face as she endures the one time ghastly liaison br br eventually paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother that indeed her mother and darren have been having sex br br this film will undoubtedly be seen by many in myriad ways sympathies will be divided at one point during paula's writing group may reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day and would leave for pubs after they were asleep making sure to get back home before her husband br br clearly a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub may however also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband didn't like her having any friends so she didn't have any she did what he wanted her to do she was miserable but she put up with it because as she said it was easier so while may was not the best mother for those inclined to have any sympathy for her one might see may's actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for a few minutes in her lifetime a woman who just wanted someone to listen to her to know her as a human being to have a friend and a lover br br paula though neurotic and unhappy perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her certainly it is not difficult to understand why paula feels completely betrayed by her mother br br it is a well done film with more complexities than i have mentioned and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many perhaps conflicting reactions it is a film worth discussing and debating and above all worth seeing br br one thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life no matter who is deemed right or who is deemed 'wrong by each viewer that theme of old age and loneliness evoking a sense of dread in most of us is inescapable
<START> i recommend families if possible to show this to older children only some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle now that thats out of the way let me explain about this movie this is in reality a documentary of a male fox who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate the beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score is breath taking you had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible it'll get ugly later they gave both the fox and the vixen names but i can't remember what they are for the likes of me he fights off this invading male to win her love they later on create a den and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs one of which is blind there are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon the first victim is the blind pup who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away the second victim is the mother who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole she unknowingly walks into a foot trap while trying to escape she rips off part of her foot causing her to bleed to death the rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree the male is now a single dad forced to take on the roll of mom and dad he alone has to teach them the skills they need for life it later proves not to be enough when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man i won't spoil the surprising ending for you but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail and it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through i wanted to say that i saw this when it first came out in early 1980s when we had a thing called showbiz cable i was only 4 when i saw it but i could never understand why they wouldn't let me see all of it now i know why after i secretly watched it when it came on disney when i was 9 i felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on i was moved to tears but as dark and ugly as it was it serves a purpose to let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals and why they are endangered this documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species and i hoped it worked its not fake like the true life nature films by disney they don't teach about why animals are going extinct the encroachment of land the killing off of the foxes main prey and senseless killing of these beautiful animals has resulted in them becoming endangered i wish they would make sequel to this movie glacier fox 2005 to see if they're being treated better maybe have it be about a vixen pup named teresa and her siblings growing up this movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes especially when one of the parents suddenly dies the surviving parent takes on the roll of both and tries to teach the important lessons of life it isn't always enough to protect them when they're adults especially when some of their lives becomes ruined or they fall victims to tragedy themselves best all around soundtrack and musical score i've ever heard
<START> i remember this movie from when i was 12 it was amazing i remember it to the day not like most thing i watched back then i have even tried to buy it but its like rocking horse sh t anyway the acting is a bit chewy but the story is amazing considering it was a real b movie with a low budget and event the fighting scenes were amazing to watch i must have watched it about 20 times it was a very well made movie and i loved the idea of fighting giant man controlled robots pity they had to spoil it by making a crappy spin off crash and burn don't watch that movie by the way it is total pants if your a real sci fi movie fan then watch this if it was re made today it would be a winner i really would love to see a remake or even release the dvd of it
<START> this miracle of a movie is one of those films that has a lasting long term effect on you i've read a review or two from angry people who i guess are either republicans or child beaters and their extremist remarks speak of the films power to confront people with their own darkest secrets no such piece of art has ever combined laughter and tears in me before and that is the miracle of the movie the realism of the movie and it's performance by bret carr is not to be missed the very nature of it's almost interactive effect will cause people to leave the theater either liberated or questioning their very identity bravo on the next level of cinema
<START> 'the luzhin defence' is a good film with fine central performances but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmaker's craft shines through it felt through most of the film that the characters just helped to push the narrative along marlene gorris could perhaps have examined the psyche of luzhin rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of others br br adapting literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task especially a novel written in the early 20th century this film does not go deeply enough into the relationship between luzhin and natalia natalia's rift with her mother comes across a churlish disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flashpoint in the film i felt that i was put through luzhin's torment and eventual tragic end without being given the pleasure of having his unusual and complex personality unravelled however this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one
<START> br br paul verhoeven finally bombed out on this one he became a joke on himself once again we have a film which includes sex and violence immorality leering at women and lots of attitiude talk between the characters and dollying pans br br its all for nothing because their is no action at all in this film it fudges all its set pieces all the actors give the kind of performances form a verhoeven film in other words rampant over acting on almost every level starship troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world the characters inhabited in this scientists are acting the same way sorry paul but soldiers and scientist are not really made of the same mindset br br one major flaw in the plot was that after escaping for that one night to do evil things kevin bacons character then returns back to the science lab where we have already spent more then enough time watching these animated manniquens elizabeth shue excepted walk and talk why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world how could they possibly track him if he could be anywhere at all think os all the different things that could have been done with this concept both in terms of story and characterisation then look at what this film does and you really how badly done and concieved the whole project really was br br more insulting is the doco on the dvd where everyone is claiming that verhoeven is some kind of mad genius well one out of two isnt that bad br br this film has nothing of note in it just like the title says br br hollow
<START> this movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects there are some interesting visuals br br aside from that it's typical nineties aughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance true to the title br br it's not worth picking apart the story that's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur there's not much there to begin with it's nothing original and not very special so don't go in for the story at all just look at the effects br br as has been mentioned it got a little flashy at the end diluting the purity of great fx treatment of an invisible and at times half invisible man however if you ignore the standard pyrotechnics it's a sight to behold or not to behold br br all in all it's a decent fx film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone
