<START> where the hell did vh1 find the scriptwriter for this movie out of high school this movie tries so hard to be sympathetic to michael jackson but instead turns him into a horrible tacky caricature all the lines are filled with clichÃ©s but surprisingly the acting wasn't bad as usual this is a bad movie with pretty good actors the actor that plays michael jackson jeez i feel sorry for him i think he did the best he could with the weak script i didn't mind that flex did not look like michael jackson i thought he did the best he could but later on when he had all that white make up on oh man did he look yucky the other actors that played debbie rowe priscilla presley and elizabeth taylor were pretty good except that the actress that plays liz taylor looked too young and healthy to be playing liz the actress that plays diana ross didn't look at all like her and i couldn't figure out who this woman was until much later on in the movie br br this movie does a disservice to everyone who is on the side of michael jackson or against michael jackson it doesn't do anything to change anyone's opinion as a matter of fact the only opinion anyone will have after watching this movie is oh god this movie really really sucks and where the hell is michael jackson's wonderful music and songs there are none to be found in this movie i love the soundtrack to this movie anyway and i'll probably purchase it if i could br br on the lighter side though this is a very funny campy movie it's a great time waster if you want to watch something light that won't trouble your brain too much i'll probably watch it again because it just is so entertainingly bad
<START> the hills have eyes is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination for one the villains look almost normal not what you would expect deranged lunatics to look like for another the pacing is very slow at times and there are many scenes of the characters repeating themselves by that i mean there is a lot of filler in the movie with a lot of running around aimlessly the film didn't have a clear direction the plot of the movie is hardly original even for its time the texas chainsaw massacre came out a few year earlier and is a much more effective film as far as horror goes the film has little in the way of scares and the pounding soundtrack just served to be both grating and distracting all at once i suppose the music was used to cover up the fact that not much happens through much of the movie though it failed in its intended purpose i basically kept looking at the time every few seconds hoping something would happen or it would end when something finally did happen any promise the film had was ruined by mere chaos and loud noise i sat through it because i like to give a film the benefit of the doubt yes there is some loud screaming and yes people die but who cares much too slow getting to any sort of pay off if you can call it that my buddy enjoyed it so at least one of us got something out of it the hills have eyes isn't the worst film we could have watched but i doubt i will watch it again this film was remade in 2006 and i will also have review of that version anyway this movie was painfully slow at times while other times was chaotic and repetitive unless you like watching paint dry occasionally interspersed with someone running around your block screaming their head off stay away from this movie a better bet would be the original texas chainsaw massacre 1973 1 5 out of 10 which is being generous
<START> emily watson and tom wilkinson together what a treat with rupert everett and linda bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue yet at the heart of it all each character maintains a streak of decency moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life how true these words are watson's anne manning is at the core of this intrigue she's the central conscience that the other three latched on she is the decency undeterred br br the circumstances of lies are to each its own one to defend one's professional name one to hold back due to family partner pressure one simply don't want to face the consequence one ironically can't believe the truth and lies to save friendship these are all precarious situations there lies the intrigue fascinating to watch how each tackles truth and lies contradictions indeed in spite of the seeming dishonor decency and heart remain strong br br the treatment of the subject involved and how each of the character behaves are masterfully delivered simple with clarity it's not sensational or complex as another film where the truth lies 2005 credits due to fellowes' writing and the nuanced performances of both watson and wilkinson there is warmth somehow that comes through the seemingly or frustratingly hidden lies beneath it all human frailty not excluded they meant well and following along with the story the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how the two seem to have grown and matured in their relationship br br you might say there's no obvious action drama or thrilling scenes in separate lies yet the intrigue is there and it will hold your attention the deserving production efforts include cinematography by tony pierce roberts a veteran to the merchant ivory films and music by with mood and tone reminiscent of composer of filmmaker kieslowski's trois especially bleu 1993 this is a british film you just might not want to miss br br emily watson anne the wife breaking the waves 1996 debut hilary and jackie 1998 the luzhin defence 2000 gosford park 2001 punch drunk love red dragon equilibrium in 2002 br br tom wilkinson james the husband the full monty 1997 the governess rush hour as villain in 1998 in the bedroom 2001 normal hbo cable movie 2003 eternal sunshine of the spotless mind 2004 recently as father moore in the exorcism of emily rose 2005 opposite laura linney br br rupert everett bill he is simply delightful in my best friend's wedding 1997 opposite julia roberts and marvelous in an ideal husband 1999 d oliver parker an oscar wilde play recently as sherlock holmes with ian hart as dr watson in pbs mystery sherlock holmes and the case of the silk stockings 2004 tv br br linda bassett maggie she was very effective as ella khan opposite om puri in east is east 1999
<START> there is an endless supply of trashy horror movies it seems that people never get tired of trying to scare and thrill alas very seldom these attempts succeed this unfortunate movie has almost no redeeming value the story is highly predictable most of the actors very uninspired or just plainly miscast special effects of very low quality it took a lot of effort not to switch off the dvd and go to bed with such a limited number of foreign movies issued in the usa why in the world would anybody want to import this drivel to top it all apparently there is an anatomy 2 for those who have nothing better to do i'd rather watch the paint dry
<START> this movie is a disgrace how can you take one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into some kind of half assed love story the entire beginning of the movie was not in the h g wells story and didn't need to be also the were done completely wrong they did build houses or form any kind of real society they didn't care about each other at all that was an important part of the story the way they had formed a world that was without hardship or complex emotions they were barely even aware of the i don't know why this movie was made the way it was but some stories should be told as they are or left alone
<START> the title of the film seems quite appropriate given the persona of the lead character he's an older man living in the late autumn of his life yet frolics about as a jubilant school boy who's just entered a spring meadow the frailties of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions to him his wife supports this idea when she observes laughs at funerals and death in other words death is not something takes too seriously he has more important things to do than worry about what already is inevitable life however and the pursuit of living life to its fullest is the philosophy that governs existence he is not one to merely exist but must live for each day and each passing moment for tomorrow is not guaranteed br br the film seems to make a strong commentary about living as though there is no tomorrow let alone death too many people take life much too seriously and consequently miss out on the actual living part of life wife for example she's so worried about preparing for death not in some religiously way but in a far too practical even lifeless way that she forgets how to smile laugh and just have a good time her humanity seems to have transformed into zombie auto pilot mode to the contrary is perhaps too blithe and absent minded for his own good he needs a person like his wife emilie to help balance him br br it's as though possesses the invincible spirit of a child like a kid trapped in an older man's body he is introduced as the adventurous type he pretends to be people he's not in order to get gain squanders money lies and is always up for a good laugh deep down though he is a kind hearted and gentle old man who wishes to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife the two off set each other quite nicely though neither one of them truly appreciates the quality of their relationship until they metaphorically chance upon death meaning their divorce it is during this courtroom scene that realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love his wife emotionally recalls all of his flaws yet is tenderly drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior in this moment of her forgiving him realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife bonkers and makes an internal commitment to make her happy br br ironically though after making this commitment he becomes what his wife later calls a living corpse the life blood within him drains away as he becomes more like zombie going through day to day motions he doesn't seem to live anymore but exist for example he gives up his zany pranks doesn't squander money quits smoking on account of his wife not his health and overall just to whatever she wants of him succinctly put he changes on account of wanting to make her happy thus the quality of their relationship begins to slowly vanish realizing that her husband is not who he used to be there is a part of emilie that misses the old she misses her husband's aloofness and the fights they used to have because it was in those moments that they were truly living not just simply existing br br i believe the filmmakers were trying to get across a specific message here that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient but often times will take sacrifice and endurance to wade through the seemingly bad times the possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live for every moment life is often taken for granted but when threatened with it literal or awake from their ungrateful and are aroused to start living life to its fullest it's as though they are scared that they'll never live again so they better make the most of it while they have it and emilie had been married 44 years with fights along the way but it wasn't till they were both threatened with the possibility of death like separation that they began to show their true colors as the old maxim goes love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation they both begin to see what matters most in life and that is the people they meet along the way more importantly the intimate relationships they make with their significant others
<START> a satire about greed and money what there is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they pathetically try to make fun of jim carrey's reign was certainly short lived he is an unbearable presence on the screen the insincerity of his portrayal is nothing short of creepy he produced this this masterpiece as well so he can't blame anyone here the number one comedy in america shout the desperate tv adds of course jim carrey was suppose to guarantee full houses but the game is over if i sound angry is because i am i spent a sunny afternoon in california plus between tickets parking flat cokes etc almost 45 bucks on this thing starring and produced by mr carry not anymore do you hear not anymore
<START> maybe i'm reading into this too much but i wonder how much of a hand had in developing the film i mean when a story is told casting the main character as himself i would think he would be a heavy hand in writing documenting etc and that would make it a little biased br br but his family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about life i think the best view would have been told from family and friends' perspectives they saw his transformation and weren't so messed up on drugs that they remember everything br br as for being full of himself the of the jesus christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life metaphorically of course he's obviously still alive as he was cast as himself for his family's happiness huh br br the viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex he lies on the grass coming down from during a high by himself and with his father he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while his arms his head cocked to the side br br it's fabulous that he's off of drugs now but he's no hero he went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle br br this same device is used in ted demme's blow where the audience with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero br br however quitting is a film that is recommended mostly for its haunting soundtrack superb acting and landscapes but the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of jia is actually a stage setting for a play it makes the viewer feel as if life was merely a play told in many difficult parts
<START> the railway children is perhaps my favorite film of all time simply for the brilliant acting of the cast the warm humane interaction of the 3 children and the people they encounter living near the railway in the beautiful english countryside jenny is especially believable in her role as the older sibling of her sister phyllis and brother peter the adventures they discover and relationships formed in their new home and surrounding area are very real and fascinating the scenery is lovely the trains a part of britain's vast history and the soundtrack is very moving this heartwarming film never fails to bring tears to my eyes each and every time as well as makes me homesick i often wonder if i should have been born in that era as i think i would have fitted in just fine as people treated each other with such chivalry and decency br br in short i consider this film somewhat of a masterpiece and a must see for anyone who considers themselves a 'sensitive or caring type' edith wrote this story around the beginning of the 1900's and what a wonderful story it is more kids today need to read this or see the film instead of playing violent video games if we had more films of this nature the world would become a better place
<START> a jane smiley novel loosely based on shakespeare's king lear about the cook family and its dark secrets director seems tamed in her approach allowing the characters to step forward and take a bow and how could you go wrong with the talents of pfeiffer lange leigh firth carradine and robards
<START> the french people are not known to be great movie producers br br though their amelie scores high points at the oscars asterix et is a very different film of what i am used to from the french it is a great movie especially for kids the only thing that me was that it was spoken in french and normally with the english spoken movies here in the netherlands i don't have to read the subtitles but with the french language you just have to read to understand the story it self is just great with who doesn't recall him self of fat but there also nice details mainly in names like and you all know the story from the comic books and this movie shows all most slide by slide the book every thing is in it from the nose braking till pirate red beards lose of three more ships i would say a great movie for the weekend with the children
<START> this is what used to be called a women's picture and later a chick's flick when times and movies got more juvenile the plot is just soap opera for women and will only appeal to those types the only appeal for most guys is if they wanna see a too rail thin mary tyler moore in leotards if you're of a certain age like me that might still be enough to give it a look otherwise mtm gives another of her typical by the numbers performances that she's been giving since the early 70s when she took it to heart that she was america's sweetheart christine gives another of those abrasive and unpleasant performances that seem a real part of her as a person and probably only appeal to those of that type sorry but it seems true ted danson is too young as husband and usually gives off a slightly creepy appeal unless he has an acting partner who can soften it and it doesn't happen here allan burns wrote directed and probably got it all through because he worked with mary before wrote it as a project for her and she had the juice at this point to get it made there seems no other purpose to it
<START> murder over new york is one of the better chan mysteries and i've just seen this for the first time br br in this one charlie chan is visiting new york to attend a police convention at the same time people who are involved with aircraft plants are being murdered and he decides to help with the investigation along with his number 2 son these murders turn out to be the results of sabotage at the aircraft plants and chan helps to identify the murderer br br charlie chan is played well by sidney toler and the rest of the cast includes sen yung as his number 2 son and marjorie weaver br br i rather liked this mystery and is worth having if you like this sort of thing br br rating 3 and a half stars out of 5
<START> i actually flipped to lifetime channel by mistake just as this movie was beginning and ended up watching it br br it certainly deals with a serious issue probably more prevalent than we realize in terms of this type of attack of a young woman by an ego maniacal fellow student who feels he's above the system and unfortunately often is br br the cast here was believable and the performances credible a lot of these canadian lifetime flicks are decidedly over the top however this is one i might label as under the top br br while appreciating the fact that it wasn't presented in an overblown fashion this film somehow seemed like a record being played at a slower speed than proper the 96 minutes seemed like many more and it had the effect of looking like a shorter film looped over and over seemingly going on and on and on and on before reaching its inevitable and predictable conclusion br br yet the engaging characters and performances made it better than the average film of this type despite these criticisms br br and while these pictures often milk the climax this one could have given it a bit more detail and length
<START> this movie is about pathetic spoiled ego driven who think they have something interesting to say performed by pathetic spoiled ego driven who think they are interesting straight from the coke filled gutters of new york's arty incestuous drama scene br br how so many viewers get tricked into making them think this carries any substance remains a mystery to me maybe they secretly long to belong too to this overpaid and overestimated or maybe they have never seen a decent movie br br get out put your hands in the dirty earth and get a real job otherwise kill your self with a real gun
