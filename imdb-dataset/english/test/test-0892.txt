<START> i've never written a comment on imdb before but this movie was so bad it left me little choice but to warn you not to waste the two hours of your life as an avid wwii historian i don't even know where to begin on how historically inaccurate this movie was carbines with korean war bayonet lugs missing cleaning and sight hoods german uniforms that didn't exist the list could go on forever added that it's loaded with flaws has literally no plot or climax and acting on par with your local high school theater the epitome of cheesy br br please there are too many good wwii movies out there to waste your time on this junk
<START> what can i say after having read herbert's books and loving lynch's movie version i was extremely disappointed i felt i was watching a reject version of buck rogers the sets looked like left overs from a star wars tv special i felt the acting was a bit amateurish by most the costumes were garish and over done which gave it a '60s flash gordon pulp feel the worms they're supposed to be sand worms and yet they appeared to big with a mouth at the blunt end the effects in general were pretty second rate i won't even start about the disgraceful navigator effect br br this so called frank herbert's dune wasn't even to his books it should have been called frank herbert's dune for dummies key plot elements were left out names were changed and the entire feel of the story was sanitised i didn't even recognise the in fact most of the characters appeared nothing like herbert's descriptions had depicted them i'm starting to get upset just remembering what a tragedy it was i'm glad i couldn't stomach the second installment
<START> some spoilers dull as dishwater slasher flick that has this deranged homeless man harry out murdering real estate agent all over the city of l a because of the high prices that they charge for their looking like an extra from a clint eastwood spaghetti western harry who's been living in abandoned houses eating dog food get's very upset where his quite lifestyle as a squatter is interrupted this happens when a number of real estate agents invaded his space in an attempt to sell the houses that he's staying at to their potential clients br br joseph stars in this bottom of the barrel horror movie as radio talk show host dr david kelly the handsome and popular host psychologist of the survival line dr kelly is being sued by the family of one of his callers tracy who ended up blowing her brains out while on the air with the doc who couldn't do anything to help her survive her ordeal of taking to him br br the real estate killer gets to talk with dr kelly on the air about his adventures and the police try to get the doc to get his phone number and address by keeping him on the line but he refuses to in order not to hurt his rating by having potential callers not call in in fear of being monitored by the br br kelly also is having a hot and heavy affair with a real estate manager and agent the busty lisa grant adrienne barbeau who's office of sellers are harry's main victims in he movie harry also gets to murder lisa's main competition in the housing business the chubby and outrageous barney resnick barry hope who threatened to put lisa out of business by any means possible even if he has to kill her br br getting alone and with his pants down harry slices his head off while he's being entertained by one of his clients a hooker whom he leaves dead and hanging together with the headless barney the movie ends with the deranged harry taking lisa hostage and having dr kelly try to come to her rescue only to have det shapiro robert looking like e hasn't slept in a week pop out of nowhere and blow harry's brains out harry quickly come back to life minus the gay matter between his ears and gets himself killed for the second time in the movie by being thrown from a balcony and landing on the ground as a dozen members of the lapd cocked and ready come on the scene br br nothing in the movie house worked with the tension laughable to almost non existent even the hot sex scenes between dr kelly and lisa didn't save the movie since there were far too few only two of them and and sexy adrienne barbeau was a bit too with not enough light and too much clothes on in all of them br br harry the killer in the movie was also a bit to comical to be taken seriously in trying to make a point to dr kelly on the phone and in person about the high rents and real estate prices in the country and how people like himself find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live in you can sympathize with harry's concern about the high cost of living but be very critical of him in how he crazily went on in it
<START> seeing this film or rather set of films in my early teens irrevocably changed my idea of the possibilities of human interaction and the range of potential experience this monumental exploration of individuals and their historical setting reveals how full bodied and intense every human existence is the people are portrayed as they are to themselves their experiences of the smallest to the largest internal and external phenomena are detailed with the greatest of artistry and perception edgar displays a fabulous appreciation of human motivations and longings br br when these phenomena are set against the immense time allowed by the length of the work one cannot help but apprehend the force and of happiness defeat lust love sadness melancholy that each person feels when i saw these films i perceived my future experiences how my life would inevitably twist and oscillate due to both intended and accidental events i acquired a feeling of the longevity of being and what it meant to reflect upon past lives memories and contexts a masterpiece and a revelation i only wish the bbc would screen it again br br if anyone knows where i can get a copy could they contact me
<START> richard is a canadian marvel and one that should be shared with the world be it for gut busting early work such as getting started and the oscar nominated snit through the apprentice and the digitally made la is a treasured local hero but no singular piece of work puts a stamp on his career quite like the big snit and did i mention it was nominated for an academy award darn br br the big snit although clearly a dated message bearer from the 1980s the short revolves around cold war esquire nuclear annihilation but don't worry Â it's hilarious as hell carries with it a larger meaning as is most of work in an understated sort of way while the planet scurries for cover from armageddon a couple bickers over each others' annoying habits in true fashion he the furniture while she shakes her eyes Â literally and don't forget to watch it again and again there's always something to look at loads this fella up with countless visual gags and memorable catch phrases br br i strongly encourage this incredible piece of animation be tracked down in canada it's usually spotted in a national film board video that includes other stellar shorts including fellow cordell barker's equally funny the cat came back americans will just have to dig a little deeper but keep at it Â the reward is worth the toil
<START> before i had seen this film i had heard some negative comments about it however when watching it i found myself thinking ok it's a little slow paced but this is quite interesting as it built toward the end it created a complex moral dilemma leading to a shocking yet within the context of the film entirely believable decision with extremely powerful dramatic consequences if this had been followed through it would have been a tremendously powerful ending and would have given me a very favourable impression of the film br br however due to an ending which not only cops out emotionally on an unnecessary happy ish ending without real emotional credibility but also within the context of the film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for you clearly see one of the character take an action which should end her life but inexplicably doesn't incidentally please tell me if i did miss something here and there is a reason why she survives as i just couldn't how logically she could have and this wrecked the whole film for me br br this said all three leads put in powerful performances although kevin characters' transformation by the end goes a little further than is fully convincing and it does create a very powerful ethical triangle br br this film is recommended if you ready yourself to walk out when the mother and the sister are lying on the bed but do not watch further than this unless you have only a pinch but several mountains of salt
<START> when i first heard about this movie i noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s i noticed the music was by elton john so i figured i had nothing to loose so i got it what a surprise the movie was awesome it was true love is all about the characters paul and michelle had no luxuries no money and sometimes no food yet they were still happy i recommended this film to all my friends but they all my tastes and even called me names becuase the movie featured two minors naked i think that only made the movie more realistic the cinematography was great and it only come to show the great abilities of director lewis gilbert
<START> having seen many of wong kar wai's other movies happy together fallen angels ashes of time i knew what to expect coming in to the theatre the cinematography would be lush the use of space and perspective would be varied the acting would be superb and at least one of the characters would be consumed by an ineffable loneliness these are after all precisely the techniques that make wong kar wai's art what it is what i was not expecting was the degree to which i was drawn into a film that some reviewers dismissed as unfinished and compelled by characters who seemed consumed by ennui br br i find it interesting how people can be so utterly unmoved by a film that so vividly displays emotions and settings many of us take for granted or work ardently to forget the overwhelming sense of grief stemming from being betrayed the guilt aroused by the thought of becoming no better than the betrayer the mundane yet profoundly intimate moments of relationships where the need to express oneself verbally is utterly superfluous this is what wong kar wai attempts to portray in the film and what he achieves so well br br too many americans are consumed by the need to have every moment of a film filled with stock dialogue witty banter disaffected sarcasm and overwrought confessions seem to be the pinnacle of the best american film has to offer wong kar wai sees things very differently instead of the character needing to keep the audience apprised of her every feeling perception or belief wong's characters make their feelings and understandings known clearly by facial gestures body positioning and yes silence br br if viewers merely contemplate this film from the standpoint of character development and action then they may be disappointed by what it has to offer if they are willing to let themselves try and what the characters are feeling then they may feel quite differently about what wong has to offer them
<START> alter egos do not come funnier than the creation of sacha baron cohen's ali g completely misled by his delusional and non existent sense of the middle england suburban surroundings that his social background consists of he persists on living the style of a los angeles while still living with his gran in the london suburb of he keeps tight control of his posse the west br br spending his spare time between me julie his girl the posse and teaching local eight year old scouts at keep it real advanced lessons at the government funded john nike leisure centre br br this is where the story takes off being told that the government funding has stopped ali g then proceeds on a one man quest in the struggle for justice i willing to lay down me life just like martin luther van dross did being his reply to the local media crew when interviewing him on hunger strike while chained to a fence br br charles dance here plays david carlton the sinister and devious deputy prime who is even more than skeletor using ali g unknowingly to lose the prime 18 000 votes three weeks before the general election seeing ali g as a bumbling idiot his plan backfires ali g suddenly becomes an over night sensation and a saviour of the people working directly with the prime the story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences br br ali g is a great british movie that brings the hugely talented attributes of writing along with dan executive production and acting of sacha baron cohen charles dance and michael as the p m play their parts with great seriousness among the gags and hilarity that is ali g br br ironically seeing the parodies playing their parts in a world that really is real and who are continually preaching keep it real from their own little world that is the west is true comic paradox br br directed by mark his first full length feature film since directing television work such as shameless shooting stars the fast show and the smell of reeves and mortimer to name a few br br very real and very funny
<START> what's the point of this film it's totally forgettable unless you have a serious bunny fetish look elsewhere so the bunnies had a merit demerit list no chewing gum in front of the customers are we supposed to find that interesting
<START> i thought there might be some level of worth to this movie and sat through the whole thing i can summarize by saying it left a bad taste in my mouth br br the movie started out ok i think the initial characterization of was true to the myths both as a child and a young adult he started out pretty strong but not the brightest bulb but later on he somehow transforms into a charismatic speaker beloved by all huh br br other problem terrible cgi the looked ok but the rest of the critters just looked terrible especially the hart the phoniest looking beast in the movie and how come leelee skin was sometimes golden sometimes normal the worst part for me and everyone should cringe at this was the twelve labors of hercules because the producers obviously didn't want to cover all of them maybe they thought us primitive screw heads watching this garbage couldn't count that high instead of the twelve labors of hercules we got the five labors of hercules yes the five labors wtf he did't even finish the last one so it was really the 4 1 2 labors just terrible i'll take hercules the legendary journeys over this piece of crap any day of the week
<START> maybe it's because i'm no fan of the comics but if the comics are of the same quality as the movie it's hard to believe there are any but this has to be one of the worst movies ever made non existent plot laughable acting dumb dialogue this movie is so bad that it hurts a lot that some people actually gave this one 10 10 is an insult to any good or at least mediocre or at least bad movie if you hate yourself then watch tank girl on another thought if you hate yourself that much maybe you should just commit suicide my rating 34 10
<START> empire of passion starts out deceptively that is if you're immediately expecting it to be a horror movie it's like a riff on james m cain's the postman always rings twice at first yoshiyuki is a mother of two and a dutiful hard working wife to rickshaw driver tamura but when he's not around and she's at home with the baby the feisty and aimless young man tatsuya fuji comes around to bring some goodies for and a little extra they're soon sleeping together but after he does something to her let's just say a shave he knows that he'll find out and immediately proposes that they kill they drink him up strangle him and then toss him down a well naturally this will come back to haunt them but that it's literally at least to them at first super terrified and then only later on skeptical changes gears into the a japanese ghost story br br this is a film where the horror comes not simply out of oh ghost ah but out of the total dread that builds for the characters in a way there's the mechanics of a film noir at work throughout if only loosely translated by way of a 19th century japanese village as opposed to an american city or small town i e the snooping cop the evidence found possibly by another word getting around suspicions aroused etc it's compelling because seiko actually was against the plan from the start manipulated by the lustful but ill prepared and her reactions to re appearances are staggering to her take the one that comes closest to poetry ghost pale blue face and mostly silent chilling stare motions for seiko to get on the rickshaw she does reluctantly and he pushes her around on a road she doesn't know in the wee hours before dawn surrounded by smoke most japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this harrowingly atmospheric br br while it starts to veer into hysterics towards the end there's so much here that director gets right in making this a distinctive work after hitting it huge in the international cinema world with in the realm of the senses which ironically got banned in his own country he made something that he claimed was even more daring that maybe he was right empire of passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor also starring tatsuya fuji a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range but its daring lies in crafting a world of dread you can believe in ghosts in this story but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hells these two would be lovebirds will go the snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries the fate of their very souls is at stake br br and takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp sadly it wouldn't surprise me if an american remake was already in the works and crafts shot after gorgeous shot with repetition working its way into the mis en scene i e the shots of seiko and walking on that road the camera at a dutch angle the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after i finish typing this i e throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion or how nude body is revealed after she becomes blind it's daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit not to be confused with the spiritual though there may be something with that as well about life and death's connections to one another inextricably it's a classic waiting to be discovered
<START> this is the last film of kieslowski one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema he intended to retire after this film so in a way it is his artistic testament he died a couple of years after making the film and though it is said that he intended to return to directing destiny decided that this was indeed his last and what a film br br the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film set in geneva one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge and immediately comes to mind but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere in the lack of communication of the characters in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final which only a great artist could have staged br br little else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the american style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers they deserve it the film gets quality as it advances and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters cinema quality is very original the image being a in as the title shows acting is fabulous with irene jacob and jean louis trintignant the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age br br a great film seeing it again probably adds and i am happy to have it recorded on tape 9 10 on my personal scale
<START> br br is a strange dark obsessive object the casting is impressive the plot is powerful reminded me of edgar poe's tales probably not a masterpiece but it does leave us with the remembrance of strong images fine music fear sadness confusion and a sentence that says it all the wolves are coming is quite forgotten now and when it was released nobody seemed to appreciate it that's a shame if you ever have a chance to see this well give it a try
