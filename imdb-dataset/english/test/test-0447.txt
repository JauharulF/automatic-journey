<START> is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects however it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story along with a magnificent cinematography the narrative structure is set around two narrative axes one of them the other each one having elements that relate and co exist in excellent harmony the story never loses the right pacing and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment which is a character in itself the acting is great and for that we owe credit to the emerging director esteban ramÃ­rez furthermore the characters are very well written and masterfully complex so once you become familiarized with them you can perceive their feelings without them even saying anything i can't say i liked this picture because of all the hype it generated in costa but rather because of the way it really achieves in showing an interesting portrait of what happens when you interfere with the equilibrium of people's lives hopefully will establish a reference for future projects in costa as it is a very good example of nice movie making
<START> this is one of those road movies that would like to tell you a lotta things about women the universe the better life the terrible solitude of the brilliant architect from manhattan who all links with everyone including his three years old child which may seem irresponsible to some actually the hero wins hands down when it comes to selfishness and the scene with his old school pal which begins as some kind of good old days conversation and ends on a threatening note is the oasis in a desert movie br br the scene with the father who left home when i was a child has been told and told and told of course it did not prevent the offspring from making his way of life and when you see the hero's wife's attitude you may think she must never have heard about woman's lib br br the best is the soundtrack which includes superb songs by willie nelson tom waits or bonnie raitt but you can enjoy them without this tedious pretentious work
<START> this is my opinion of this movie expressed in its dialogs br br to be more serious i can't say this movie is a bad moment but i didn't enjoy it either br br first i was simply indifferent couldn't get my mind into the apes world even though the make up are very realistic the constant screaming was irritating may the film have changed apes for cats and it's a cult movie for me in relation to my fondness of the latter br br the second part is more interesting with the talent and freshness of then newcomers macdowell lambert but i felt alienated all the story is located in a big british mansion no matter how luxurious is it it was like a prison for me br br at last it could be a good adaptation of the burroughs' story of tarzan i don't know having never read the book or seen the disney br br in conclusion i don't have any good moments to remember so one viewing would be enough for me br br i should have guessed my boredom after the endless freeze called overture at the beginning what's the meaning only the director knows it
<START> though the our gang comedies still have their followers i've got to say that their attempt to graduate to feature films courtesy of hal roach came up way short why did roach have to pick the civil war as is subject with all the attendant racism that would follow br br dashing southern cavalier phillips holmes takes in young orphan spanky mcfarland and his young black friend buckwheat thomas after spanky inadvertently exposes a card cheat on a riverboat all is placid and serene in the old south and then the civil war comes to ruin it for everybody br br but even children can charm the worst in the world and there's none worse than those damn yankees they just come south and ruin it for everybody br br criticized though it was for its southern viewpoint gone with the wind did make a good case for the southern cause and the blacks portrayed even though servile which they would be out of necessity are still three dimensional characters hattie mcdaniel would not have won her oscar if it were not so butterfly mcqueen's character of prissy as silly and vacuous as she was has some dimension br br here though is maybe some of the worst racial stereotyping ever brought forth in hollywood the companionship of spanky and buckwheat does show that kids get along racial feelings are acquired not inbred it's not the of the blacks that's objectionable but there total acceptance of it right from that horrible watermelon song sung over the title credits the message of general spanky is a bad one br br yet it did get an oscar nomination for sound recording probably one of the very few hal roach ever got out of the short subject field br br general spanky is far from gone with the wind though
<START> although is 15 years old tonight was my first time ever seeing it i had heard about the movie but there was never a buzz about it to make me go out and rent it or make a point to see it period well i caught it on one of the premium channels and i must say that it was very good br br this movie was about some brilliant young medical students deciding to explore death they have figured out a way to cause a person to die briefly and bring him her back to life besides the all star cast this movie had some serious bite to it just the very thought of exploring death is riveting enough but i really thought the writer director did an excellent job in giving a different yet hair raising view this was no generic attempt to thrill frighten and make one's mind race this was the real deal br br instead of making it an empty superficial star studded thriller this movie had substance a nail biter white knuckle edge of the seat hard nose thriller i give it an 8 10
<START> i saw this back in 99 and i remember loving it still to this day i can remember parts of the movie in my head like the slanted pitch unfortunately from 99 now i could never remember the name of this until i was looking through the filmography of a friend of my uncles and came across this he played clive straight away after reading the description i knew what it was after catching up i was shocked to find out that not only did it not make a release on video or dvd but still has yet to be repeated this is a massive shame i am begging you itv at least repeat this superb tv movie nick hancock showed in this movie he could do more than just host a show with his character mike this is a movie that most football fans would love and even those who aren't too keen on the sport would be able to enjoy the comedic value of this yes this is a brief review but there is not much to say apart from this is an underrated movie deserves to be repeated or released on video dvd so itv myself and other fans of this movie beg you please consider one of those
<START> mike judge's idiocracy is an interesting film and one that his fans will undoubtedly track down and see br br before i start the review i would preface it by saying that if you get a chance to see it definitely do as it is worth watching and isn't the easiest film in the world to track down br br let's start with the premise luke wilson is private joe an army librarian who is deemed to have absolutely no outstanding attributes or glaring flaws making him totally average in every way this along with the fact that he has no living relatives makes him a standout candidate for an experimental procedure also frozen with joe is a prostitute named rita who was pimped to the project by her abusive pimp unfortunately a few days after they are frozen the top secret project is abandoned and they are forgotten about br br they wake up in and find that with the dumbing down of society following the trends of recent times everyone on earth is only slightly more intelligent than a chimp the way that everyman joe talks is seen as being much as someone speaking like shakespeare would ridiculed now and a former professional wrestler is the president of the united states actually this one probably isn't that outrageous really the best show on tv is called ow my balls which admittedly sounds pretty good and not only is everything spelled wrong but signs seem to have run out of space for the wording leaving them to be bunched up at the end br br it's a funny premise for film but this is the problem aside from the initial premise not that much in the movie is truly funny what i mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind from having read the premise of the film are probably about as funny as the film itself obviously it's not terrible but it probably could have been funnier br br there are some winners in the script such as starbucks now offering happy endings and people placing their blind faith in the universally misunderstood electrolytes but they are just too few and far between so unless you are going to laugh hysterically every time one of the idiots of the future slurs out a slack jawed profanity laden sentence with little to no logic and or intelligence then the laughs might be pretty well spaced br br it's unfair for everyone to be comparing it to office space because it's a very different film but as a film regardless of what came before it idiocracy is a funny concept that will probably have you laughing a lot more in the opening 15 20 minutes than in the rest of the film br br i give it 5 out of 10 because it is enjoyable but doesn't do enough to raise it above middle of the road
<START> caution possible spoilers just watched 'joe' for the second time the first time was 30 years ago on an air force base i was reminded of that by the air force overcoat with tech sgt stripes wore by the boyfriend dealer we airmen had quite a laugh the first time that appeared on the screen because that is a rank over the years i have carried several other images from the film foremost was the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive as someone else commented you could not take you eyes off her i did not realize until now that this was a 20 year old susan sarandon in her first movie what a loss that she did not do more movies when she looked like that i also recall the irony of having a counterculture hero like peter boyle playing the title role of a right wing gun nut not unlike george c scott playing generals in dr strangelove and patton and of course the shocking ending made a lasting impression br br 30 years ago it was the most talked about movie that ever played on the base we thought it was a great film then and i have been reluctant to see it again because i was afraid that it would be as disappointingly dated as easy rider but watching it today i was amazed at how well the film has held up it is a very strong script with few holes although you have to wonder about the boyfriend immediately getting out of the bathtub when sarandon gets in with him br br searching for an explanation of why this film is still so entertaining i have to think it has something to do with the perfect physical casting boyle was physically believable as joe as others have pointed out his portrayal would inspire the archie bunker character a few later did ted knight model his character judge after the dennis patrick's advertising executive in 'joe' they look alike and sound alike patrick was totally believable as the wrapped too tight upper middle class executive and sarandon's doe eyed innocent with the ann doll still evokes a protective response from all male viewers perfect casting br br the nude and drug scenes actually hold up they were very provocative for their day and are as explicit as anything to be found in about the only thing that dates this film is that the violence is not realistic or graphic 'joe' was about the same time as 'the wild bunch' and the tone of movie violence had a just begun to change br br another reason this film holds up is that events in the past couple of years have brought back the relevancy of the theme and context of this film in the film both types of are portrayed as full of fear and hate toward the unconventional ways of the counterculture and filled with envy at their free and hedonistic lifestyle the counterculture is portrayed as mocking the straight culture and although paranoid toward conservatives legitimately so given that this was just a couple months after kent state they cannot resist flaunting their lifestyle in an attempt to the political landscape is not all that different 30 years later i'm not sure conservatives envy young people and liberals as much as 1970 but they fear and hate them more br br an excellent film that surprisingly is as relevant now as it was in the early 1970's
<START> when someone refers to the independent cinema realm in the united states it's often inferred that it means the filmmaker or people behind the project had much more creative freedom and did what they wanted this today is not really always the case unless someone is a solid auteur and creative freedom still comes with the caveat that one has to find distribution with one of the independent divisions of major studios or by getting picked up somehow for some kind of low level deal at a worthwhile film festival but robert downey film about a tough as nails african american accidentally promoted to head advertising guru at a production company is independent cinema the kind of work that went right along with the likes or romero's night of the living dead and cassavetes faces at the same time of getting no real typical studio distribution but causing waves kicking ass and taking names in the cinema world for all its moments that are rough and crude it's unforgettable br br it's also a film that is funny very and excruciatingly funny sometimes the sense of humor is just so ridiculous it's nearly impossible not to laugh from the mere appearance of the president with his wife to lines of dialog from the advertisements team puts together like i can't eat an air conditioner in a real soul voice it is as smart as the audience it is aiming at which is anyone with two brain cells to put together who can see that this work isn't offensive or too shocking because it's meant to rattle the cage and it does this pretty well in the first five minutes once that's past downey sr goes on his blitz of sorts as far as being a filmmaker with nothing to lose his protagonist is part fidel castro part isaac hayes circa 1972 and yes it's 1969 in the film and part hard assed ad exec with a firing streak to make mr on the jetsons look kind and don't forget those side characters dear god br br there's so many memorable lines and moments that it's hard to keep track from maybe the most hilarious botched assassination attempt in any movie to the one ad for face off skin cream that includes lines that would give south park a run for its dirty mouth money to just little asides with the one guy from jack hill's movies playing the muslim who keeps giving lip to and that one boy with the the nun who curses up a storm and impresses in a swift stroke it's a pretty direct message about media and advertising but there's also a lot of powerful moments where it just hits the nail on the head about racism in america sometimes without having to do more than a gesture and sometimes with doing something huge like having black panther types going this way and that around advertising regime and for a low budget production i mean super low hence the comparison to night of the living dead and faces downey got some really good actors all non union and it's hard to imagine that some of them might have had their first time on camera here br br it should be mentioned that downey's style doesn't make it perfect it is crude and sometimes too crazy and dated for its own good and i'm sure i didn't get some of the underlying humor of a couple of the ads since i'm from a full generation after these ads were aired albeit the miss redneck jersey was definitely not lost on me in general though this is one of the finest of its time period a satire that stings and a feature with a predominantly black cast that is all too knowing of what comes from an excess of power regardless of skin color it is as someone might say good s
<START> this film did entertain me with lots of laughs at the actors who kept the film moving along in all types of crazy directions if you like suggestive language and sexy looking gals they were all in the picture and gals and guys all looking burned out before they even graduate from high school there is one scene where the teenagers drive their car into a very fake deer and then proceed to throw it out into a lake or ocean which is repeated over and over again there is no horror to this film except the word horrible for the entire picture and arnold who plays a plastic cop is really one sick character please don't waste your time viewing this film
<START> believe me when i say this show is just plain hilarious the basic story is about kintaro oe who travels from town to town taking part time jobs chasing women and learning all he can about life kintaro has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made he takes everything to the extreme and it's just laugh out loud funny every time from his constant never ending quest to study life to tiny things he instantly blows up into life or death matters br br one of the funniest things about this show is simply constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions he spends a great amount of time in various super deformed modes like dragon half or other times in less then 0 1 seconds his face will turn not just serious but manga fighter style life or death expressions like a weight lifter trying to a new record it's hilarious br br if that wasn't enough the writing is superb and the english voice acting couldn't possibly be better english va is just perfect and will have you rolling around when he's not even really saying anything the one thing to mention though is this is without a doubt an ecchi series it practically defines the word if you're an adult anime fan who can get a laugh out of movies like american pie you'll love this br br com
<START> sorry folks but all of you that say this is a great documentary and that award it won at sundance well you've all been duped i've heard for a few years how i had to see this documentary and i finally watched it maybe in 1999 when it came out and reality tv didn't have such a dominant presence in the industry this movie would have seemed entertaining but mike and mark are so obviously playing themselves mike and mark at times they are funny and some of the lines seem off the cuff but mostly they do not ring true they are the reality version of jay and silent bob yes the people are real they are not actors but it's put on it's exaggeration of themselves and it's so obvious that it's hard to believe so many people think it's the real deal i wasn't fooled so it was actually a tad boring mildly amusing but not missing much if you miss it
<START> this film was nothing more than exploitative gay cheesecake it was not an art movie just an excuse to show several gratuitous exploitative over the top scenes with extensive male genital nudity there was a locker room scene involving over a dozen naked men the camera zooms in on the men's asses and penises as they are portrayed for several minutes with their dicks in full screen view there are several scenes in this film showing penis after penis it gets redundant real fast and makes it impossible to take this film seriously i was wondering if i was watching a playgirl video by mistake if these same scenes were filmed using women ex totally naked and showing their vaginas repeatedly it would be quickly dismissed as just softcore porn and an excuse to show a lot of eye candy which is all that this film is any artistic merit got flushed down the drain of the gay ghetto mentality the themes of class distinction homosexuality longing desire etc were simple and superficial no more developed than what one would expect from a first year philosophy student just cut to the chase and rent a gay porn instead
<START> that's how i was when i walked staggered out of this film i couldn't leave because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people i was stuck in the middle trapped br br the tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen the daughter was a stand out performance stand out in the bad sense br br thge cinematography was hideous consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting i've witnessed br br as for the stock footage well at first one br br wait br br why am i reviewing this film why do i acknowledge its existence please don't watch it do something useful with two hours of your life and go watch some paint dry
<START> this film offers you a fascinating trip through one of the most exiting cities of today istanbul and its musicians do not expect a compilation of turkish folklore or anything like that alexander a german musician and member of the cult band travels to istanbul to get to know the music scene his sparse voice overs of what he experiences are a guiding line through the film but mainly german turkish director faith akin lets various artists from istanbul do the talking and of course their music br br you meet a variety of personalities big stars and street musicians young and old people playing many different musical styles but this movie does not only introduce you to the sound of istanbul it also draws a compelling picture of istanbul today and how turkey has forged ahead in the last decade the film characterises its protagonists with subtle humour but never without respect all of them share a passion for music and the belief in its power br br akin again shows his talent to portray diversity lightheartedly when he brings you close to completely different musical scenes after his award winning feature film gegen die wand head on faith akin proves with crossing the bridge that he is equally able to touch entertain and guide his audience in a documentary if you have never been in istanbul you will want to go there after having seen the film
