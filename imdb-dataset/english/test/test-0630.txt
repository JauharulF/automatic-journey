<START> this movie needs to come out on dvd cause that's the only way i will buy it i thought it was soo funny because there was no real plot to it it was not suppose to be an oscar winning film i appreciate those films cary elwes was a very cute robin hood i can't even think of my favorite part of the movie because they are all pretty good anyways peace out
<START> another pretentious film from vicente if la of the same at least its quality was superior mainly thanks to the great performance of pilar de but carmen is boring and full of topics ardent brunette with a dagger in the stocking poor man dragged to madness due to passion sierra nevada gangs br br obviously paz vega is a pretty woman but about its talent there're more doubts and role is so stupid that results almost incredible the script is weak and and presumptuous character influences the entire film with these ingredients the result could not be good br br not the worst film i've seen but a complete failure in my opinion
<START> some possible spoilers br br of course this film could not be expected to be as good as the original remakes rarely are but this remake of one of hitchcock's greatest films psycho could have been a lot better br br first of all whoever cast the movie must have been psycho i mean vince vaughn as norman bates what where they thinking unlike the harmless almost childlike bates that anthony perkins was able to portray vaughn looks like he would could be a murderer in efforts to make his bates seem innocent vaughn ends up acting gay many of the other actors didn't seem to fit their parts either including julianne moore who just didn't seem to fit in the film br br on top of the atrocious casting the cinematography is notably shabby despite the fact that they remade the film scene for scene the one thing they added were random shots of object such as clouds or a nude woman in between the shots of characters being murdered these shots seemed to be irrelevant to the plot in anyway and in turn made no sense br br overall this psycho remake which could been a decent picture instead turned out to be a complete waste of time
<START> seriously where is al pacino's oscar nomination for this one is it that we take him for granted at this point in his career pacino here is extraordinary he gives a complex heartbreaking performance as shylock the jewish money lender the movie as a whole was quite great with beautiful shots of venice to look at and a pitch perfect score to listen to the other actors all do a fine job as well but the real reason to see this is pacino i have seen all the nominated oscar performances of 2004 and i must say that pacino was snubbed blame it on the anti semitism associated with the play the lack of campaigning by the studio the late release date with no major push or most likely all of the above in my mind the best performances of the year belong to jamie foxx in ray don cheadle in hotel rwanda and al pacino in the merchant of venice
<START> was inspired by events on the track during ww2 when australian militia slowed and ultimately stopped a push by 10 000 japanese soldiers to move and capture port what they really mean is that the movie is set in this time period but is fiction and everything that happens is just a jumble of standard scenes from other war films the first hour is just one clichÃ© after another some of the scenes are simply there to be able to draw us into a feeling that this conflict was horrific beyond compare when there appears to be little evidence of this both sides fought hard to control the track and no mercy was shown by either side both sides suffered from shortages and the terrain was a great leveler in this conflict as the japanese got closer to port their supply line grew and this ultimately led to their downfall on the other hand as the australians retreated closer to port their supply line decreased some of the scenes appear to be straight out of the handbook on standard scenes to include in any war film the film was misguided and highlighted the youth of the production team at a time when australia could have done with a great film about one of australia's best moments the film is a shallow disappointment
<START> and generally speaking you will eventually have to research this little gem when describing i changed my sex or glen or glenda as it is better known i must echo the thoughts of andrew smith who so hit the nail on the head when he wrote if you haven't seen any of ed wood's other movies this one is a completely bewildering experience if you have seen any of ed wood's movies this is still completely bewildering the film is both hilarious and tragic yet it moves with a strange rhythm of its own that leaves one in no doubt that its author knows and means every word he is saying during its running length wood bless him had some of the ambitions as a director wanting to promote peace understanding and even acceptance in the 1950s of all times when tim burton recreated a viewing of glen or glenda by studio execs for his biopic he showed the execs laughing and telling each other that this had to be a put on more than fifty years later there are still people fighting just to be given the kind of respect that the normal take for granted so i say it most certainly is not br br no the real comedy in glen or glenda is the sheer ineptitude wood displays in composing his message directors frequently use stock footage when they can find some that suits their purposes and can be edited to fit with their own footage ed wood used stock footage indiscriminately and tim burton's biopic celebrated the fact with a scene in which wood as played by johnny depp bets that he could make an entire film out of stock footage sadly the real ed wood died before he had a chance but glen or glenda is the closest he ever came the imdb states that twenty percent of this sixty something minute film is stock footage and it is never difficult to guess which footage footage of busy highways planes flying overhead poor lightning effects soldiers doing their thing they're all used in a haphazard manner sometimes repeatedly and they often only have a loose connection to the story wood is trying to tell had wood been able to sit back and think about what he is trying to do for a while there is no telling what kind of heights he could have achieved br br wood himself appears in the film as the titular character a confused transvestite who imagines himself as a woman named glenda aside from the daring manner in which he attempts to make his point wood makes one hideous woman having found myself out on the fringe of a society that thinks i am disabled and need to be cured myself i honestly found myself hoping for the best outcome for wood's character in order to make his point however wood weaves in short stories of two other transvestites one of them takes the extreme step of enduring a sex change in order to become a woman the other finds himself so disenfranchised that he fears being arrested again so much he commits suicide the scary thing about this film is that if you edited out the transvestism and substituted such disenfranchisements as my position on the autistic spectrum or such things as schizophrenia very little of the film would even need to be changed that is how little society has learned since ed wood was a boy br br the other significant personality in glen or glenda is bela lugosi whom wood shoehorned into the film speculation varies upon wood's motives but the accepted theory is that wood wanted to help revive lugosi's career and would do anything in order to achieve this with the exception of taking his time to carefully construct a good film that is in glen or glenda wood makes usage of lugosi that was best described in flying saucers over hollywood as bizarre lugosi plays a character billed as the scientist but comes off more as an omnipotent puppet master people who have not seen ed wood films before the biopic will think tim burton made up the beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep speech if anything burton was being restrained about which bizarre speech to use in depicting wood ian dialogue nothing can prepare you for seeing the speeches in their original context not even hilarious ranting during plan 9 from outer space br br observant types will also note the presence of delores fuller wood's girlfriend at the time again burton her reaction to seeing the script for the first time whereas the film portrays her as being accepting and forward thinking i cannot help but feel that burton's portrayal is more accurate as fuller looks extremely uncomfortable in her role she only appears for about fifteen minutes but her delivery seems so mechanical so lifeless that she somehow manages to seem less talented than her cast mates if such a thing is possible whether wood's direction was better focused in this case than usual is hard to determine but if the ability of the support cast to leave the stars with the obvious exception of bela in the dust is any guide then it should come as no surprise that fuller would only appear in a very small role within one other wood film that she went on to write a number of hit songs tells you she made the right decision to stay behind the camera while wood would appear before the camera again it was never as more than a cameo a walk on or a bit part br br i gave glen or glenda a one out of ten i generally only give this rating to films that are so bad they become entertaining as a result bold and well intentioned as it was glen or glenda fits that description to a t
<START> before seeing the sneak preview today of angels demons i cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it the enormous amount of hatred towards dan brown the fact that it was written by dan brown and because dan brown's name is slapped on all of the posters i went in with an open mind and expected the worse but instead what i got was a 2 and a half hour roman cat and mouse game with forrest gump and that is by all means good entertainment value br br the movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself harvard robert langdon hanks jets off to rome after the sudden death and the re election through papal arranging all of this is the patrick mckenna mcgregor however he soon learns of a new threat one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known an anti matter time bomb that vatican city is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals langdon using his intellects and trust me you'll be hearing a lot from it is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious path of illumination aiding him on the quest is scientist who is also the co creator of the anti matter br br the movie itself runs at an uneven pace one minute langdon and the swiss guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes evidently slowing the book's much anticipated action thriller sequences down it makes for an interesting read on paper but on screen it can go either way br br the character's are decently written onto the big screen ewan mcgregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable patrick mckenna famous accent included tom hanks is slightly more agile intellectually and physically since his last performance in the mediocre da vinci code plays commander richter the straight faced leader of the swiss guard unfortunately neither his nor performance are worthwhile ones and instead of playing a part in the story they are just kicked aside as assets br br however angels demons accomplishes what could never a thrilling fast paced movie filled with satisfying explosions beautiful recreations of st peter's square and including many of the churches and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour ron howard does a decent job at directing this second langdon adventure this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases almost br br while newcomers might call it a national treasure 3 with a much larger threat there is still enough contagious suspense thriller eye candy and brilliant still shots of rome to breathe in fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates a d does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder br br a good book to movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain br br 7 4 10
<START> i'm not really sure what to make of this movie especially after seeing a great film like la notte unfortunately i saw this in german during an antonioni film festival at the frankfurt film museum so i didn't get to hear great voice he is supposed to tie together four stories about couples in italy however as good an actor as he is malkovich cannot rescue the most ridiculous of the four stories portrayed here a woman who comes up to him at a waterside cafe near a shop she owns and blurts out about how she killed her father nearby then the two of them go home have sex and he leaves it seems as if antonioni lost the subtlety had in earlier films like the passenger when dealing with sex and replaced it with blatant nudity br br however nonsensical the storyline is the film features two things that make it watchable eye and ear candy the actors and actresses are all beautiful people and the cinematography is marvelous scenes in old italian cities contrasting with a bit in a tall apartment building overlooking a city reminiscent of la notte br br the ear candy however is what really makes the film worth watching u2 and brian collaborated on your blue room and beach sequence both of which set the mood perfectly in the film the songs are available on passengers original soundtracks 1
<START> i had noticed this movie had been on cinemax a lot lately so this morning i decided to watch it i had just finished the which is a great movie and i thought this looked good as well from the description the cable had atleast this film was awful it's slow the pacing is horrible it feels as tho it lasts 4 hours there's no real plot to speak of how can anyone say anything good about this movie rickman is good but he always is the other two characters work well but there's no real story to support any of it after 2 hours and you sitting there wondering what on earth is going on where on earth is the plot it ends with a surprise that frankly just made me sick don't bother with this one
<START> how did they get that cinematic shot of the car colliding with the back end of the semi and then roy sits up great looks like the dvd is scheduled for may of 2006 about time watch this on a large screen or film revival in a theater if possible in order to fully appreciate the full aspect ratio my other favorites in this category are original italian job with michael caine bullit with steve mcqueen to live and die in la with the csi guy when he was young french connection with gene hackman ronin with robert deniro vanishing point with barry newman enemy of the state with hackman again what are your favorites
<START> oh boy this movie is so mediocre i don't really know what exactly to write about it br br i think it's easier to write what it's not br br it's not very entertaining it's not original and there's not one character in the whole movie i cared about br br kind of reminds me of a certain reality tv show on mtv but without any interesting people it just drags on and on and i could hardly wait for it to end the only thing that kept me from switching it off was jennifer lyons c br br i thought a long time about this movie to find one good thing to say about it what i liked was the reminder not to judge a person by the first impression you get as holly did when she accused nicole which earns it a score of 2 out of 10 instead of a 1
<START> for many years i thought i was the only person on the planet who had seen tempest and i am so glad to learn that i am not the only person who discovered this sleeper somewhere in their movie going travails loosely based on the shakesperean play tempest follows an architect the late john cassavettes in one of his best performances bored with his work and his crumbling marriage to real life spouse gene who decides to chuck it all say the hell with the rat race and go live on an island with his daughter molly ringwald in her film debut and new girlfriend aretha a luminous susan sarandon even though paul mazursky is credited as director cassavettes hand is all over this film the long scenes filmed without cutting the improvisatory feel to the dialogue the self indulgent storytelling style this is definitely his show from beginning to end and if you're not a fan of his work the film will seem laboriously long and dull but if you are a fan there are rewards to be had cassavettes is surrounded by a first rate cast his scenes with rowlands crackle with intensity and his surprising chemistry with sarandon is a stark contrast to his scenes with rowlands ringwald shines in her film debut and there is a scene stealing performance by the late raul julia as cassavettes' manservant on the island julia stops the show in one scene dancing with a flock of sheep accompanied by liza minnelli singing new york new york this film is sad and tragic and funny and intense yes it's a little long and disjointed and it works a little too hard at being different there's even a curtain call at the end of the film but it never fails to hold the attention of those who like something a little different in their filmgoing
<START> i first saw this film when i was about 6 ish my grandma thought it'd be a nice kiddies film to entertain me and keep me occupied however every time i watched it i had nightmares the same night yes it masquerades as a kids' film but even now i find it really dark in places particularly the haunting music that is played each time the guardian angel woman is on the screen and her rather hypnotic eyes and voice the actual baddies of the film ie the sharks mr etc didn't scare me at all i just always found the whole film rather creepy and dark this is obviously something i can appreciate now that i'm 21 years old but speaking from experience there is no way i would show it to my kids
<START> this is going to be my first review on imdb and i'm glad that the standard rating is 1 out of 10 because then i don't have to change anything br br first there are awful movies movies you can make a laughter out of like island city battlefield earth or conan the destroyer that is totally acceptable they makes a great party enhancer then there are the worst movie ever i cannot believe how utterly crappy this steaming pile of dog turd was br br i found it on a second hand store on vhs and bought it quickly because i like sci fi terminator post apocalypse and stuff like that everything on the box art was very promising then i loaded in the tape quickly when i got home and the first thing that i noticed was what there was maybe 10 minutes or more of switching between present clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect with sounds that makes you puke and it just continues over and over then some acting kicks in and you wonder why you were ever born in a world where this abomination of mankind actually exists and then i realized there are actually two prequels i didn't think about it first but the title says 3 in it and i was horrified but as i actually in great pain and agony watch it to the end i thought nothing could ever make me feel worse about myself and this universe but then a little text showed up saying next and nemesis 4 no please no
<START> the film tackles the here and now horror of rendition with a multi cast trans global account of all involved no one gets off lightly because we see the blindness of the players as they carve out their own slice of the worldwide game piling hatred and misery on their enemies and themselves in equal measure br br the interplay between the sympathetic senator's aide played in scintillating style by peter sarsgaard and the real washington power mongers is electrifying meanwhile out in the field new cia man jake gyllenhaal goes through a sea change in his attitude to the usa's new found cosiness with torture sudden though his rejection of what he initially tacitly condoned is one has to ask why on earth would anyone who calls him or herself civilized stand and watch anyone be humiliated and abused in this way the film has few heroes perhaps gyllenhaal's flawed and vacillating cia man is the exception and a necessary indulgence to make the film offer a sliver of hope br br the sad fact of course is that this film isn't fiction at all but a wake up call to those with a shred of decency left in them the awful truth is that we in the uk and usa have lost the moral plot and this film shows how low we are prepared to go all this in the name of freedom there's a wonderful line in the script that says that torture is a sure way to swell the numbers of our enemies this is already happening in real life and we should listen to the message that this film delivers and start using our might and money much more intelligently the message seems to be that any of us who claim that rendition torture and the abuse of basic human rights are necessary to protect our way of life are as wrong headed and stupid as the jihadists and suicide bombers br br all praise to the sensibilities of a talented south african director with a eye on the gross unfairness of how power is exercised and a cast of principled mainstream actors from the us and beyond oh and by the way the film has a sting in its tail with the ending a clever and thought provoking surprise which i won't give away br br i saw the film in an early london preview so it has not yet been widely written up but i'm glad to say that the tide of less than glowing reviews seems to be turning the bbc review has been very strongly in support and they and i suspect that much of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple specs of hollywood where the good guys and the bad guys are cardboard cut outs hence the reason that many of the truly great films of the year are increasingly indie and or non us pix
