<START> this is a 1972 disney movie for the time i was eleven years old and i thoroughly enjoyed this movie feeling nostalgic i purchased the three series dvd's of the dexter riley movies and even now at age 46 i still enjoyed them it was all about fantasy magic and clean fun and it still is i wasn't sure which of the three movies came first then second and last so now i have the official dates on december 31 1969 the computer wore tennis shoes on july 12 1972 now you see him now you don't on february 6 1975 the strongest man in the world i still think the middle movie was the best the special effects were amazing back in 1972 to us kids i definitely recommend it to all ages
<START> one of the better movies to come out of the 1980's this based on fact movie tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend leaves her naked body on a river bank and brags about it later to his friends what is just as bad is their inability to feel anything about it br br disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic kids who have no respect for their parents or any sort of authority who seem almost doomed to live lives of rebellion and recklessness this drama hits hard and is impossible to forget the young cast does a creditable job even keanu reeves in one of his earliest roles is better than usual of course there's no reason for the character of crispin glover to be as crazed and off the wall as he is but that's just glover being himself veteran dennis hopper has an especially good role as a loner who despite his own sordid past is saddened by the attitudes of this group of kids i would like to point out the chilling performance by daniel roebuck as the young murderer he's an under rated actor and aside from hopper his is probably the best performance in the film br br i saw river's edge for the first time a long time ago when it first started being shown on cable tv movie channels however i didn't catch all of it i saw it in its entirety for the first time a number of years later and now i've seen it again for what is probably the definitive time br br some potently affecting moments include madeleine's constance breakdown where she wails that maybe she should leave her children just like their worthless father did i also liked the scenes where matt reeves faces off with his disturbed younger brother joshua miller and when the teacher mr jim metzler the fact that the girl has died and that none of his students seem to care br br i will never forget this film not as long as i live it's too saddening for that br br 10 10
<START> i have to hold my hand up and say that i was one of the first and probably the last to see this film where do i start it's a complete mess the main attraction of course was the soundtrack which goes without saying is brilliant it's what himesh does best but as they say don't give up your day job hr definitely shouldn't br br acting is plain and simply awful even if the film had a plot the thing that baffles you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there two words of advice to hr give up acting and secondly use br br hr has no screen presence no acting skills and the female lead looks just a little too young for him as for malika just the same old bollywood vamp crap br br you can package the product as much as you want but if there's no substance it won't hold don't waste your money
<START> a lot of the films i've made probably could have worked just as well 50 years ago and that's just because i have a lot of old fashion values steven spielberg br br some points br br 1 though this film is a loose remake of a guy named joe it also borrows heavily from a matter of life and death and wings of desire br br 2 this was spielberg's second attempt at being frank capra br br 3 spielberg has often said that he wishes to make a frank capra movie in the vein of it's a wonderful life and mrs smith goes to washington judging from his recent attempts to get a harvey remake off the ground it seems as though spielberg still holds this dream the director rightfully not satisfied with his last 3 ventures into br br 4 critics at the time bashed always stating that the elaborate action sequences distracted from the film's romance but that's really not the problem at all the problem is that always needs a lot more special effects to distract us from the fact that spielberg can't film any line of dialogue that doesn't end in an exclamation point br br 5 the film is filled with comedy that just doesn't work spielberg's comedic tastes aren't very sophisticated and seem to be ripped right out of 1950's screwballs and looney tune cartoons these exaggerated antics may work in a cartoon universe but in a film it just seems like an odd marriage br br 6 the film's lead couple come across as brother and sister not lovers spielberg's films have always being apprehensive toward sex and intimacy but this film goes to extreme lengths she's a wisecracking tomboy and he's a wisecracking old man they're more irritating than endearing br br 7 the film contains one good scene in which john goodman argues with holly hunter but for the most part the film's characters are too annoying there's no subtlety every emotion overplayed every joke over designed every sequence filled with unnecessary br br 8 always and hook taught spielberg how to con audiences after their failure and the twin financial failures of the color purple and empire of the sun spielberg dumped the goofy colour cinematography of color purple and empire of the sun in favour for the more desaturated black and white worlds of schindler's list munich minority report and saving private ryan from here on less light and dark cinematography became equated with serious topics br br 9 after the financial success of each dark film spielberg reverts back to his colour cinematography and falls flat on his face once again amistad followed schindler's list ai followed ryan and lincoln will follow munich these colour films are always bashed for being too tacky sentimental corny and hokey but the truth is if you removed the all these serious films would feel the same way br br 10 since the 70s spielberg has tried to differentiate himself from the other brat pack directors scorsese de palma coppola etc by pretending to be an optimist and humanist he would himself state this repeatedly during many interviews in the late 70s the reality though is that he is probably the biggest sadist of all these directors the very form of his films often undermining their content their very box office performances always to their dazzling displays of carnage br br 11 the failure of spielberg to connect with any of the characters in always and the relish he shows instead for filming forest fires air planes crashing etc perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography people running from dinosaurs sharks nazis tripods rocks etc this is what spielberg delights in the moment his characters stop to speak however everything self destructs a film like amistad failed in other words because not enough blacks died and too many whites talked br br 12 the film's flying scenes aren't up to the set several years earlier in the mega hit top gun of course when your enemy is a forest fire it's hard to make things cinematic br br 13 failures like 1941 hook always etc are often more illuminating that spielberg's more successful films they reveal the steel skeleton beneath the technique they show what the amusement park ride looks like when its not working revealing the vacuum beneath the broken machinery br br 5 10 Â there's one good sequence here two actors in a room simply improvising but this is mostly an annoying picture with a predictable script br br worth one viewing
<START> the frogs who wanted a king or frogland is ladislaw starewicz's most cautionary tale about people wanting government to solve their problems that i've ever seen the ironic thing is that they pray to the god jupiter for their answers jupiter responds first by sending a tree stump and then a stork neither works out and the stork is especially dangerous to the creatures the frogs have some human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashions of the day and we see some take pictures or use a movie camera when the stork arrives like i said this short is very much a political allegory more suitable for adults than children in fact i first saw this on the rhino vhs that had bambi meets godzilla that alone should tell you what to expect here
<START> friday the 13th meets the matrix as with all of these stupid horror movies everyone knows who has been killed and who will be killed next but do nothing to prevent anything all with the added cgi action effects from the matrix hasn't the world seen enough matrix
<START> there are so many logical errors in this show it's barely worth me stating 1 mystic is non existent 2 is as powerful as majin yet plays absolutely no role in the show somehow he is easily overpowered by every bad guy 3 the whole super saiyan 4 idea is retarded and it's appalling that he loses to super 17 which is the worst idea for a db villain ever 4 super saiyan 4 goku is no match for super 17 but non transformed goku using a move he learned in a movie that wasn't supposed to happen kills him with ease 5 is utterly useless 6 no character other than goku has any impact to the outcome of the battles 7 the series ends with a spirit bomb come on 8 goku invincible absorbs lame 9 better yet goten trunks they both suck 10 super saiyan 4 involves a magical transformation into an adult 11 goku is a kid 12 goku is a kid 13 no super saiyan level 2 characterized by electricity 14 no imagination with the animation of 15 utterly useless 16 big bang is the biggest let down in anime history not really logical but i'm going off on a tangent 17 shortest character fights ever br br i could go on longer if i hadn't repressed the majority of memories associated with this show when i make enough money i am going to fund the remaking of this series
<START> was a good film at the first i was wondering what is going on organic pods made out of mutant reptiles which connected you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game via a umbilical cord well it seems a little odd br br but once it gets going its a pretty good film with a few twists with a great open ending and the good aspect of throughout the film is entertaining too see as your not sure whats coming next br br security personnel throw away the metal detectors they have bone guns
<START> i couldn't relate to this film i'm surprised that people are it for being so 'realistic' how many people at your school were victim to incest how many closet homosexual jocks were there how many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide hmmm ok you wouldn't know even if their were but really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with and yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored but hey where's the 'entertainment' in that br br with regards to the girl who committed suicide i found this to be exploitative i actually think many people in high school at some stage feel invisible ignored and unwanted but what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed the filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative and the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative i didn't buy it as a real life scenario br br and the problems of the other students i didn't fully relate to bullying is explored but that's been done to death we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person closet homosexuality pfft another clichÃ© gets rolled out thats the thing really too many clichÃ©s i guessed the ending at the start there was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense you've got all these characters with explosive problems and one with apparently none and i thought what is the point of this character unless she's the unsuspecting suicide victim and surely enough br br one thing i will say and it is the saving grace of the film is that it does not glamourise suicide the suicide is very graphic and heart breaking to watch it is a powerful scene regardless of how contrived it is and one that dismisses suicide as the easy option but the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes br br not bad but certainly not groundbreaking or worthy of a 17 minute standing ovation at cannes
<START> 1st watched 6 24 2007 4 out of 10 dir stefan ok thriller but a little too predictable this story is based in germany which is also where the movie is made it is about a young medical student who gets a shot to go to a premiere school in heidelberg and arrives seeing some strange things occurring someone she met on the train there and saved shows up on the school's experimentation table and she's suspecting foul play right away she does some investigation and the disappearance of her friend leads her to a secret society called aaa and no it's not alcoholics anonymous that has something to do with the anti hippocratic oath and is used to perform on live people that doctor's wouldn't normally be able to do she finds out her grandfather who was a dean at the school was a big part of establishing it and it's pretty readily filled by members of the school it's an interesting story but the problem with this movie is how quickly the audience is told what's going on and then it's kind of a horror movie with the heroine fighting off the bad boy of the group that's taking things to the next psychotic level although this movie was made in europe it plays to a young american audience with it's focus on gore sex and the horror film premise which is really it's big downfall and explains why it probably made good money and spawned a sequel but doesn't necessarily make for a good movie
<START> i sell the dead is a big sloppy horror comedy that refuses to take itself too seriously this has advantages and drawbacks the 85 minutes of the film breeze by and the film is full of bits sometimes funny sometimes scary sometimes gory occasionally all three at once but the individual bits are much better than the sum of the film's parts br br the story such as it is follows professional grave robber arthur blake played by dominic monaghan arthur's partner in crime willie larry fessenden has just had his head chopped off for murder and arthur has one night left before his own head is forfeit for the same crime arthur insists that he is innocent of murder but there are plenty of other crimes that he is willing to confess to when bribed with irish whisky by a catholic priest played by ron perlman br br since the movie is a series of grave robbing anecdotes confessed by arthur it becomes a sort of horror anthology a series of disjointed tales all linked by a similar cast arthur and willie and a similar theme grave robbing like most horror anthologies there is no consistent mythology because all mythologies are true and happening simultaneously even when they contradict one another br br it probably didn't help that i saw this film the same night as trick 'r treat a horror anthology that avoids all of the traps that i sell the dead falls into in fact trick 'r treat designed as an anthology tells a more unified consistent story than i sell the dead which is intended to be a united narrative br br the other problem with the film and i recognize that this is insane nit picking is the way the film plays fast and loose with history is killed with a guillotine we might be able to stretch a point and say that he is killed by a scottish maiden a precursor to the french guillotine but the scottish maiden was abandoned in and this film is set a good hundred years later since burke and hare are mentioned and they were executed for murder in grave robbing as an industry became obsolete with the passage of the anatomy act 1832 so the film must take place before then br br i know that bringing this up is the ultimate in historical nerdiness and we are clearly dealing with a universe where all sorts of dead undead and legendary dead are possible but the easiest way to anchor a fantasy to convince the audience to suspend their disbelief is to use something real and authentic to bounce the fantasy off of and it's not like the history of grave robbers or body snatchers or call it what you like is a boring story br br the most frustrating thing is that writer director glenn clearly does know the history especially the good bits as an example when first takes on arthur as his apprentice he correctly explains to arthur that as they don't steal the clothes from the dead because stealing corpses is a misdemeanor punishable by a small fine while stealing clothes is a punishable by deportation or possibly even death so you would expect and arthur to strip the corpse at this point and for the rest of the film but of course they don't you could accuse the director of ignoring his writer's script but not when the writer and the director are the same person br br my point isn't that there should have been a lot of buck naked corpses in the film my point is that if you are going to bring up this quirk in the law and make it clear that willie and arthur will follow the law no matter how silly it is than you do have to pursue that thought to its logical conclusion even if that means that willie and arthur wind up chasing a zombie through a graveyard trying to rip his or her clothes off and stuffing them back in the empty coffin so that they don't get deported for stealing the walking corpse's clothes otherwise don't bring up the matter at all br br historical nerdiness aside i sell the dead is worth a rental as a slight but funny horror film that could have been much more
<START> all men are guilty says the chief of the police they're born innocent but it doesn't last add this bit of nihilism to jean pierre melville's fascination with the idea of the code of honor and you have le rouge this code of honor among crooks however is not simply a clichÃ© it's a figment of the imagination even when film realistic by their viewpoint romantic by most others' began to make movies on the subject their theme is that it isn't what one does but how one does it we most often wind up with stories all about experienced men with their own sense of honor stories where fate fatalism and the code run things br br for most of humanity except screen writers and movie directors this would seriously get in the way of living one's life raising one's children and being a good friend this mannered fatalism is something of a self indulgent notion le rouge is in my view a classic film for people who may secretly enjoy the adventure of just missing the last bus home but where melville's le samourai criterion collection in my opinion is style dominating story le rouge manages the great trick of combining style with a strong story and with compelling actors the point of the movie in my view is nonsense but the movie itself is a first class experience br br melville's hopeless tale of three crooks cory alain delon vogel gian maria and jansen yves montand is based on a bit of wisdom which is maybe attributed to the buddha that all men who are destined to meet will along with their destiny they cannot change maybe because some believe melville himself came up with the wording if not the thought either way we know right at the start that this movie will not end happily will depend upon fate and coincidence to set things up for us and will leave us recalling the nihilistic philosophies we discovered and loved when we were in high school once corey and vogel meet and then gather in the unique talents of jansen we are off on a one way ride to rob an exclusive heavily protected jewelry story on the place the tension arises because we not only know the french police are after vogel we also realize that some determined crooks are after corey br br the great pleasure of the movie for me came from admiring the work that delon and montand brought to their characters and the intelligent ruthlessness that andre brought to his character the police captain mattei melville hooked me as he developed these characters and their own situations he built me up emotionally and then released me when he brought me to appreciate their probable fate and let me see see it happen melville establishes his set pieces the escape from the train the escape from the woods the later shootout in the woods the meetings with mattei and a man who refuses to inform with intriguing possibilities he builds tension in all these cases by taking his time a rare trait in movie making and an even rarer trait now and melville takes the time to build up mattei as an individual mattei is a rueful experienced man he's a loner he has a set routine when he returns to his apartment he greets his three cats affectionately he draws his bath and while the tub is filling he sets out food for them i don't know who mattei is destined to meet but i hope it's someone who likes cats br br nihilism is always fashionable among some creative people and some critics in most cases i think it's a much harder task to set nihilism aside and to simply live one's life without damaging too many people and that's even more challenging to show compellingly in a film le rouge is a movie which for me tells me little but it is in its own way i think a beautifully put together film
<START> i won't reiterate what so many others have said about this film i'll try to add a few new points the coolio as vampire bit is a nod to fans who are familiar with his turn on the blondie song no exit in which he assumes the role of a rapping vampire it actually works as a musical concept and is in fact a great song casper van dien is no worse than brad pitt and is actually more handsome and really what does anyone go to a brad pitt movie for other than eye candy same here although this is poorly filmed check out starship troopers instead and of course udo kier after having played dracula in the morrissey warhol film has little more than a cameo enjoy it if you can
<START> i had stifled high hopes for this david lynch whom i really like film but the very poor acting by everybody but naomi watts was the first clue that this was a wasted effort some twin peaks characters are recycled into this film but it wasn't eerie it wasn't interesting except for the topless watts scenes and the quirks were poorly executed br br i will probably give lynch one more chance but the hype around this film just doesn't pan out especially for those of us fans who saw eraserhead when it first came out
<START> 1st watched 3 17 2002 2 out of 10 dir mario silly sex filled master slave having too many intimate relations movie this movie seemed to care more about the sex than the story and kind of worked the story around the sex laughable dubbing of the original italian language in the version i watched with ridiculous ending where the attempt is made to give an anti slave statement or should i say one line what a waste of time for everyone who watches this trash
