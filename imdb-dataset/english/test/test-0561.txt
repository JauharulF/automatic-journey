<START> i gave this movie a four star rating for a few reasons first i felt that this movie was definitely preaching and i hate that still it's my own fault for watching a christian movie in the first place br br my friend and i rented this movie because it sounded interesting the back of the case said something along the lines of a spiritual battle someone opening some sort of boundary that let demons into our world and the like something i am very interested in indeed this movie almost hit the target it was more like on the edge of the target more on the tree than the target itself br br the basic plot of this movie is two couples are abducted by a group of terrorists to be victim to experiments however because their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual realms the men of the couples are now able to feel smell hear and see the demons of the spiritual world in that order apparently the sense of taste is not present in that realm br br this movie is very clichÃ©d they took the title seriously as the men while chained to the beds demand their women look behind them because there is something there br br although a good effort for what it was i think the special effects could have been done so much better the demon scratching at the woman was in a word hilarious the wife was obnoxious as hell and everyone in the room practically cheered when she died we were all hoping she'd be beaten by the other woman with the chair though br br the message is one that i don't care to comment on other than i think the christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it br br and so i give it four stars because it is not the movie's fault i am not a christian and don't like this type of message and i got a kick out of making comments throughout my friend and i watching this movie seemed to resemble an episode of mst3k
<START> michael jackson's thriller 1983 has to be the greatest video ever made dude you have zombies gore and a catchy tune what more can you ask for john landis mixed elements from night of the living dead and american werewolf in london and out came this video what starts out as a nice evening for a young couple turns into a date from hell literally you have dancing zombies a werewolf in a funky jacket and vincent price rapping a cool video to a song that everybody in the neighborhood marked out to br br i have to give this one a high recommendation because it has to be the best music video ever made there hasn't been another one like it br br check out the making of thriller the documentary has some interesting stuff in it
<START> the film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then we get to know that the hero is a cop who is either suspended or has probably retired i did not have the patience or the interest to verify the above before commenting if there is a stereotype for narrators to have a deep sleep inducing voice then it is high time to put an end to it i seriously fell asleep and did not bother to shut the movie down either am still trying to figure out what the movie was all about and why there were no outdoor shootings a third rate tv serial will have more number of sets compared to this crap of a movie and i still pity the actors and producers involved in this huge bullshit of a movie it ought to have been produced as a normal tv serial or maybe even as a local theater drama instead of putting it out on the big screen total waste of time and money the movie was supposed to be in production for a long time and it would have been better to have left it that way with redundant sleep inducing dialogs and sets this is the worst movie i have come across
<START> ok ill be brief this film wasn't just bad it was very very bad with like if you deal with the devil you expect to get sh t on your shoes you know your in hideous film territory after watching this film i wanted to kill myself and my entire family it gave me such a vast feeling of self loathing i wanted to do murder don't watch this film i will kill again but when i do it will be terribly edited with a pathetic soundtrack and stock shot for hire action sequences and bad shirts br br fortunately there is a flipside its the first action film to feature a three door ford sierra br br unfortunately it ends up trashed on its roof br br ps worse than the marksman
<START> fred the hammer williamson delivers another cheaply made movie he might have set a new standard for himself look for the painfully obvious special effects mortar cannon that is visible in the street during a chase scene you don't see it just once you see it several times look for the out of focus shot in one scene and the camera operator try to fix it as the scene rolls on watch this with a group of people and make your own mystery science theater
<START> when dubbed into another language let's face it neither nielsen nor schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialog and given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a loose loose situation any type of voice over is sure to be an improvement and it actually is at least in the german version br br but that is only a minor point the acting is bad the speeded up combat sequences are pathetic nielsen couldn't use her sword to fight her way out of a wet paper bag this becomes painfully obvious when compared to the fluidity of motion exhibited by the kid who has had some martial arts training no doubt and to the athleticism shown off by bergman br br schwarzenegger does his conan thing nothing new here br br some of the visuals are nice i'll have to grant that the dragon skeleton bridge looks cool but more often than not the plaster is all too evident br br overall the movie isn't worth seeing even the is better than this although only marginally i would have much rather seen bergman as red sonja as she was originally supposed to be but i doubt that that could have saved this movie oh well br br 3 10
<START> in some scenes in the rain people francis ford coppola's precursor to his hey day of the seventies there is the mark of a similar situation to 1969's easy rider but not exactly in the same reference frame here we have a drama about disconnected people from society in some ways alienated by the choices or by limits imposed by one mean or another it's one of those rare original dramas where some scenes stand alone as total knockouts even with such a low string budget and a very freewheeling so to speak attitude about filming the movie coppola is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters and the curved unexpected degrees of one character versus the helplessness of another or vice versa or both and as one might be inclined seeing as how it is very much about the cutaways of suburban life of the 1960s it has that escapism of the film mentioned before but of a more concrete near timeless quality with the drama and the underlying issues in a way if bergman were on route as a quasi guerrilla 20 something filmmaker out to get the strange truths of everyday outsiders this might be it br br but along with all of the very direct and sometimes self conscious photography though also with a more documentary approach at times akin with its characters the actors all fit into place shirley knight an actress i'm not too familiar with has a complex role as a pregnant wife running off in a sort of existentialist conundrum of what life is there to have there are moments of some awe inspiring acting by her and one of my favorites if not my favorite is when she is on the telephone calling her husband the first time such a tense scene on both ends and in every small gesture and inflection of a word so much about her is spoken with so little it's extraordinary in ways that mirror others in coppola's films then comes in the character of 'killer' played by james caan this too is a dangerous character to take on as it is a mix of childish bewilderment and amusement with scarred memories think forrest gump if he didn't make it past the football and wit it's one of his best actually by being the most minimalist for a guy who's usually playing tough guys in movies here's one that also is part of the crux of the story and of knight's character also very good in a supporting role is robert duvall as a cop with a rough side and rather checkered past kind of an early sample of other defected characters he would play later on in his career br br so the characters and what coppola risks in having an uneasiness running in them are really what make up the film as whatever story there is it is definitely not resolved in the usual way you might think or expect the last ten or so minutes are like others in coppola's work where the specific tragedies on all sides are undercut by the emotional and psychological implications this will leave on the principles are amplified to the sublime and sad this is for its time brave on the part of what is trying to be represented in both the freedom as well as the flaws and ambiguities in the subject matter and the style of the picture adds a fragmented kind of view onto it all with quick flashbacks that are graphic and self contained in a contrast with the longer shots in some crucial scenes it's a road movie of its period but its also got a lot more working than it would under another filmmaker with less chances to take on the nature of these outcast characters one of the best films of 1969
<START> another period piece for chen can't remember him doing a modern film br br good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises none of the hk fighting scenes or the hollywood type of heroes but it is good because of it the characters are strong i really felt for them br br understanding the mandarin definitely gives the english subtitles the edge the film is 3 hours but it didn't feel like it
<START> this movie contains real animals been killed like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an been cut open i find this totally deranged and sick and seriously question the mental health of the director of this trash br br this movie is so stupid and daft that it has no logic at all br br there is a lot of boobs and sex in this movie still don't bother viewing this trash for that if you want to see boobs and sex watch a porno instead there is also rape scenes in this movie which i found disgusting like women been raped and cut up and eaten this movie is for sadists and those who get their kicks seeing people been cut up and eaten br br a lot of the animals like the monkey that appeared in this movie there is none in the jungles of new guinea the local characters most of them appeared to be asian and none look like they come from new guinea it looks like this movie was made around the grounds of a resort which i bet it was br br stay away from this trash its sick and deranged
<START> wow as soon as i saw this movie's cover i immediately wanted to watch it because it looked so bad sometimes i watch bollywood movies just because they're so bad that it will be entertaining eg koi mil gaya this movie had all the elements of an atrocious film a gang of local thugs that is completely harmless a poorly done motorcycle scene horrible dialouge congrats son i am very proud that you are a bad boy actors playing basketball as if they are good atrocious songs me bad me bad me bad bad boy unexplained plot lines like why are the good boy and bad boy friends and why is the hot girl in love with the nerd i've never seen such a poorly constructed story with such horrible directly some of the scenes actually took 30 seconds long like the one where the good and bad boys inexplicably ran over the gang member's poker game congrats you are a bad director if you want to watch a good movie watch guru if you want to watch a movie so bad that it's actually entertaining then watch good boy boy
<START> ridiculous film where two swinging college graduates move out to california and one becomes a movie star and the other his manager br br as 10 years pass the star's popularity is so it is determined that there will be a television show where women will compete for his affection br br the film is obnoxious and ridiculous the girls who vie for lover boy are made to look foolish only one girl seems to be the choice of the producer of the show she is really an amateur up against some of the other women but she is wholesome and brings good ratings to the show as well br br by the third scene you realize that the manager is falling for her br br we know that ryan really was meant to be a bachelor while the ending is somewhat cute you really know where this was going
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this film when it was first released and on each occasion i've seen it since the political drama is effective if not especially new or inspired the decades since the release of the film have demonstrated that the willingness to cut costs at the expense of public safety is definitely not just something imagined by a screenwriter br br however i think the most impressive element of this film is jack lemmon's performance it is absolutely astonishing to watch him at work he has the gift to be able to communicate so much at times without saying a word next time you watch this film check out jack's face at the times he is not saying anything he does not need to speak or worse yet to mug to let you know what's going through his mind br br i am calling this a spoiler because of the impression it made on me when i first saw the film in lemmon's last scene in the film as he is lying on the floor he feels a slight vibration the terror in his eyes is one of the most frightening images i have seen in any film it is perfect acting because it conveys instantly the threat about to occur if jack's character is so terrified there is certainly something awful about to happen and it does
<START> imagine if you took the christ myth mixed it with a healthy dose of porn against a backdrop of bad sci fi from another planet like throw in a dash of after school special and lots of really bad kung fu fighting oh and some decent break dancing with an awesome casio keyboard soundtrack br br and some how they make this even worse than you could imagine there are at least 4 rape scenes at least one great car explosion a buff black guy running around in his undies with an uzi br br add alcohol and this is the perfect movie br br i mean lots and lots and lots of alcohol
<START> barney is that idiot dinosaur who didn't go extinct with the other dinosaurs many eons ago instead he sings stupid songs and has stupid morals about life that are 100 worthless and or extremely dangerous that is strangers are your friends you haven't met yet the reason why i say he's evil well on youtube there's a video of a barney song about toy balls when it's played backwards it comes out as we'll all come hang you let's stab the knockers don't believe me see it for yourself i also read on another review that they are now reading out pc folklore and fairy tales now that is just stupid with a capital s i mean really anyways i don't recommend letting your kids watch this filth as it contains stupid morals like strangers are your friends as said before there is never a reason to be sad and if you are sad eat junk food being an individual is taboo magic can solve all of your problems and heaps of other ridiculous crap
<START> dark and bleak sets thrilling music that cuts through your spin like or razor a perfect cast lead by broadway greats and lansbury this is exciting theatre flawlessly transferred to the small screen sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our age and todd is his masterpiece from the brechtian opening ballad to the darkly humorous act i finale a little priest where lovett and todd fantasize about the victims that will wind up in their meat pies this play never ceases to thrill excite and satisfy betsy joslyn also excels as johanna even she as the plays ingenue seems slightly mad edmund turns in a bravado performance as the corrupt judge who lusts after joslyn and is the subject of todd's vendetta lansbury and command the show as only two great actor stars can do other musical highlights include todd's johanna worst pies in london and the act ii opening thats good and that is a title to describe this production
