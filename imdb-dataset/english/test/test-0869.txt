<START> this comment discusses north and south book i dealing with 1861 period br br the 19th century history of the usa is mostly identified by people with the civil war 1861 1865 this is a reasonable opinion because that was civil war which put the union under the severe test that was the civil war which made americans realize how precious it is to live in peace finally that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery br br from the birth of motion pictures there were people who adapted that time onto screen d w griffith in the early 1900s made his unforgettable birth of a nation yet the most famous film about the north south clash is still i suppose gone with the wind 1938 unfortunately fewer people know the magnificent tv series based on john novel north and south it is the very best tv series ever made and the time spent on watching it is really precious i taped it on my video from polish tv many years ago and have come back to it with great pleasure many times since then why br br firstly the entire story is deeply rooted in historical reality the two families the from south carolina and the hazards from pennsylvania represent two entirely different ways of life in spite of that friendship unites them yet what they experience is the struggle all people do friendship attacked by truth of political correctness love attacked by hatred of legal spouses gentleness by strength of social heroes orry maine patrick swayze is my beloved character someone who finds love and who is quickly deprived of her someone who cares for friends but political fanatics step in the way and ruin much finally he is someone who can see the tragic future for his land but there is nothing he can do about the inescapable fate his friend george hazard is similar in most aspects but sometimes he appears to have a stronger character it is him who shows orry that although there are tragedies he must get up from despair and live since life is the most precious thing we have although they represent two different lifestyles their friendship occurs to be stronger than any prejudice politics or conflicts br br other characters are also particularly well developed there are villains like justin or salem jones who are really wicked but most of the people are ambiguous as the nature of humanity has always been charles maine is at first full of rebellion prone to fighting later however he learns to be a true southern gentleman for whom southern pride is not courageous words but foremost courageous deeds hazard represents the most fanatical side of movement striving to condemn slavery and punish the owners of black breeding farms her marriage with grady appears to be a symbol of equality but also a symbol of saying no to the politics of the south two interesting characters are sisters brett and ashton sisters in whose veins runs entirely opposite blood brett in her gentleness but also naiveness believes in absolute fidelity she marries billy even though he is a because she truly loves him brett is the representation of all that is precious in any young woman ashton however is a vamp a tigress a woman who does not hesitate to do the most wicked things the clear picture of their world views clash is their chat about men and family unforgettable moment and how universal most characters head for their values yet war breaks out and they'll have to put aside a lot br br secondly the performances someone said that not all people act naturally i wouldn't say that i'd rather say that all cast do very good jobs in their parts from the main characters who are portrayed by younger staff to the guests that consist of famous stars including liz taylor robert mitchum and others patrick swayze as orry does a great job i consider this role one of his best ones lesley anne down as madeleine is also very memorable her part perhaps entails too much suffering but she manages to express all sorts of feelings really well kirstie alley is very appealing and truly memorable as the hazard phillip casnoff is worth consideration as horribly ambitious bent as well as david carradine as a monster husband disgusting justin and in contrast to him a mention must be made of jean simmons who is truly excellent as mother whose heart beats for the glory of family life and of union br br thirdly memorable moments of north and south leave an trace in one's mind who can forget the first meeting of orry and madeleine what charm what gentleness there is in this scene or is it possible to skip the moment when madeleine's father dies i found it really powerful there is a real drama in this moment a drama of a woman being left by someone who really loved her i also liked sequence and george hazard so worried about the life of his dearest friend orry then his meetings with constance are terrific speech in philadelphia is a masterpiece of performance and the final moment of the first part although north and south may separate their friendship will never die orry and george symbolically join hands as the train moves on simply there are so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it's impossible to mention even half of them here and these gorgeous tunes by bill conti and shot in brilliant landscapes the music in north and south is very touching and memorable br br what to say in the end north and south is a real must have on dvd simply an amazing tv series about the victory of all that is precious in us love friendship loyalty honor truthfulness absolute fidelity 9 10
<START> this movie is one of my all time favorites i have watched it probably 100 times literally and it is still funny to me it seems that every time i watch it i see something different mel brooks is definitely the all time king of side splitting comedy
<START> minor spoilers i just wanted to say that for anyone who likes entertaining baseball films this is definitely in my top three only little big league and major league can compete with this one in my mind i would also like to commend the writers of this film for creating such enjoyable dialogue without being too specific i would say that the lines are very fitting for each character tom selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ballplayer his animosity towards playing overseas in japan sets the tone for comical yet meaningful interactions with his new team the dragons he must adjust to life in japan first you wash then you bathe he eventually sees eye to eye with his coach and sets his goals to have that one final season of greatness though in a much different environment than he ever imagined so for any baseball fan or anybody that wants to watch a good baseball movie mr baseball will not let you down
<START> and one only in my opinion br br that reason is margaret leighton she is a wonderful actress on stage as well as on the screen we have few chances to see her though i think that's especially true in the united states br br here she plays a sympathetic role not only that but she is also very pretty and meant to be something of a bombshell br br walter pigeon does not hold up the tradition of drummond performers he is always reliable but he's not much fun he's not a rascal or a consequently this seemed to me a talky endeavor with little action or suspense but check it out for leighton
<START> this movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in russia epic movie about russian culture great saga of russian spirit endless articles and interviews for me this movie was the biggest disappointment the main character played by oleg is a stupid immature boy ready to set up his comrades because of a woman who doesn't even look like a lady what is there to admire in the first part of the movie the story doesn't develop at all people's festival scenes look like boasting about russian audacity br br i respect mr for his previous works both as actor and director but this movie just demonstrates his ambitions to be considered the of russian cinema
<START> not the best of the but not the worst either i honestly feel guilty laughing at this film considering it had to be career lows for all involved yet the acting dialogue preposterous scenarios and the ever present boom mic get to me everytime and certainly add to its bad movie charm as much of a linda blair fan i am top or topless honors go to sybil danning also special kudos to henry silva who's the only one in the cast who doesn't play his role too seriously viewing the film now though makes me look at stella stevens character more closely she plays the head officer and i have to wonder if this where hilary clinton decided to adopt her current look and demeanor after all i'm sure she had to look no further than her husband's video collection to find this film not that i'm judging i've seen it several times myself and it all makes me wonder what would've happened if mr clinton had been allowed to install a hot tub in the oval office hmmm
<START> dashing errol flynn brings his usual flair for drama in this historically flawed but entertaining film of the life of george armstrong custer the dashing jovial flynn essays custer from his days at west point as a reckless headstrong cadet through the civil war years in an extraordinarily generous and partisan interpretation of history and finally as the nonpareil indian fighter whose blunder at the little big horn is excused as a sacrifice by custer of his command as a way of exposing the corruption of government officials and post traders as well as a protest of the unfair treatment of the plains indians olivia de havilland flynn's co star in several other films scores as the devoted adoring libby bacon and anthony quinn looks the part as the fierce sioux chief crazy horse the film's battle scenes are excellent the civil war battles are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which custer seemingly supported by just a handful of troopers hammers the confederate army into submission custer's last fight against the indians is a grand spectacle a savage clash between red men and white with no quarter given in a wild mix of military might between determined fighting men great direction cinematography casting and wonderful music by max steiner make this film a hollywood classic
<START> heaven mary and all the saints above a young man has got super sperm it's miracle bejesus call the pope all you ladies out their desperate to get preggers line up out side his door and drop your marks and sparks finest risible retro ealing comedy type comedy trying to bring you a bit of the auld irish charm has an effect like placing two fingers down your own throat maximus one out of ten
<START> after consuming human pork chop and properly digesting it i felt urged and obliged to inform potential viewers that chewing on this product is no fun and its substance of low value br br according to the dull nature of this film the following is gonna be a warning more than a review this is the first time i wished that there is an i don't care to rate this movie button on imdb because the only reaction to this boring piece of trash is stasis and indifference every possible rating would do injustice to all the other items listed here a 10 is out of question anyway 1 might persuade some readers that this is one of those cases where it's so bad that it's actually really bad and that's kewl and 5 is unsatisfying as well people might think that it's an ok flick and alright if you wanna have some cheesy fun which it is not honest to god it's neither a 10 a zero nor a 5 it's nothing a black hole a futile work conceived by an embryo i bought the region 3 dvd which was cheap 7 bucks at least and of good picture quality i bought it mainly because of the positive and promising reviews posted below my own entry oh boy was i to be disappointed this movie is neither shocking nor disgusting nor unnerving nor it's not even laughable it doesn't take itself too serious to be laughed at but still serious enough so as not to be comic a truly amateurish effort the only sequence that i found mildly disturbing is when two giggling thugs put an ugly dog in a bag and bash it against a brick wall but even such a cruel premise only lead to a poor execution the further down cited toilet scene is unrealistic and without any sense for suspense suffering or humiliation the feces look like painted marsh mellows there is a butchery scene at the end of a loooong 85 minutes where three men dressed in plastic a setup which one finds also depicted on the front cover of the dvd start to dispose of the female body reminded me of american psycho and shallow grave now these flicks are worth watching and true masterpieces br br let's be realistic for once and not rush to make a myth out of every asian wannabe scary movie as seems to happen lately br br if you are looking out for some eastern horror then try danny lee's masterpiece of the very same english title ba xian fan dian zhi ren cha shao bao human pork chop it's from 1992 and has not without reason i might add been compared to henry portrait of a serial killer there is also a similar film telling the same story by a different film crew called ren dou fu there is a secret in my soup of the same year sort of a rival production it's available as a region 3 dvd and by most regarded as superior to peng shi zhi sang jin tian liang i might add a few more words on the special effects what special effects there are a few chopped off limbs they look awful in a wrong sense probably made in hong kong br br that's about all the info i can share on this subject hopefully it will prove helpful enjoy your meal
<START> this film is supposedly about three young idealistic people two of whom join the movement and blah blah it is really just another film about some beautiful rich people trying to decide who they should bed next the peasants and and the political struggles of the era merely serve as a picturesque backdrop literally as we don't hear the villagers say a word never mind learn anyone's name thus they occupy the same 'role' as the in old hollywood films the movie is also dull and the story does not actually get us anywhere except to various bedrooms we are apparently supposed to admire the of it all which merely means no good song and dance routine which would not have saved the film of course but might have at least the boredom br br my friend was annoyed at the immorality of the whole story not the bedroom bit but the whole pointlessness of the story the message seems to be that ideals are not worth pursuing
<START> i've been looking forward to the release of this movie since i first heard the concept two years ago and i was not disappointed i won't bother summarizing the story since everyone else has but i will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout the performances were great as was the music and the main characters were likeable br br my only complaints are 1 the story was definitely lacking the movie wrapped up very abruptly in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot since the plot wasn't nearly as important as the music and the action this didn't really affect the entertainment value of the film so this is not as major a complaint as it would seem br br 2 this is really nitpicky but the music that the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated after 1985 when the movie was set devil inside was from 1987 and ac are you ready was from 1990 among other mistakes this bothers me a bit since they obviously went to lengths to make a good period piece they could have checked the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier again not a big deal br br oh i thought of something else that was strange the steel dragon band members were supposed to be english but for some reason bassist jeff and ozzy guitarist played band members and they each had a couple of speaking lines in american accents that was kind of lazy also but it was still cool to see actual musicians playing musicians so i will forgive that as well br br i could probably nitpick all day but i don't want to give the impression that this wasn't a super entertaining movie i will probably buy the dvd when it comes out and i will certainly buy the soundtrack cd simply for the six steel dragon songs some of which were sung by the singer from the band if you remember them the highlight of the film was possibly a great outtake where mark wahlberg is to a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays good vibrations by marky mark and the funky bunch the surprised look of mark's face is priceless classic rock and roll flick score 8 10 due to extreme entertainment
<START> i love exotic science fiction fantasy movies but this one was very unpleasant to watch suggestions and images of child abuse mutilated bodies live or dead other gruesome scenes plot holes boring acting made this a experience the basic idea of entering another person's mind is not even new to the movies or tv an outer limits episode was better at exploring this idea i gave it 4 10 since some special effects were nice
<START> the white warrior is definitely one of if not steve reeves weakest films set in 18th or 19th century russia steve plays a warrior who tries to over run a mad man russian czar by running up a mountain side with his rebel band in a goofy looking russian white tunic for the most part the great reeves physique is hidden in a goofy knee length tunic with an even more sillier looking russian hat br br the action is rather minimal with only a good wrestling scene from the mid waist up that shows off the great reeves physique this is an apparent attempt by the producers to move reeves out of the sword and sandal genre into another historic era with poor results the dialogue from the script is hard to understand at various points and only commentary from the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene i would image reeves regretted making this film but in an attempt to try and get out of his toga and sandals and tribune armor it helped launch him to other historic characters such as morgan the pirate and the thief of baghdad
<START> a special unit of four police detectives are dispensing justice in their own unique way in 1950s los angeles nick nolte plays max hoover the unit's lead officer and his partners are played by michael madsen chazz palminteri and chris penn also starring are melanie griffith jennifer connelly and john malkovich among others quite an impressive list of names unfortunately that is the only thing even remotely impressive about this film br br our story begins when young allison pond played by connelly turns up dead in a remote area of town currently under development our band of four detectives is called in and it is immediately obvious that nolte's max hoover is going to be taking a very personal interest in this case we will soon find out that allison in addition to knowing hoover quite well was also involved with some rather important military and government types who may have had reason to want her dead but who exactly was involved and why exactly would they want this seemingly harmless woman dead hoover and crew set out to find out sounds like an interesting premise but unfortunately it goes nowhere br br despite the impressive array of names the acting here leaves much to be desired nolte is overacting madsen seems incredibly bored palminteri and malkovich come off as caricatures penn has hardly anything to do and griffith is dull as can be by far the best performance is connelly's in all too fleeting flashback sequences the dialogue throughout the film is forced and wooden the sense of drama you would expect from a mystery of this type is missing altogether nothing dramatic really happens in fact nothing at all seems to happen for the bulk of the picture instead we just slog along towards a rather ludicrous and incredibly disappointing climax when the mystery is solved you may find yourself saying oh come on now is that all there is but it gets worse as after the mystery is solved we get a completely ridiculous and utterly unbelievable action sequence and even then we are made to suffer further as another awful badly acted completely unnecessary scene is tacked on at the end and then mercifully it is over and not a moment too soon
<START> this is a very realistic movie it's the most realistic i've seen on urban youth the actors were great i will look out for more films by gomez i had never heard of the film until someone mentioned it recently i bought it on dvd i was impressed i haven't seen anything come close to life as i know it in philadelphia this comes real close in fact one scene where there is an accident i won't spoil and give details reminded me of a nearly identical situation in philadelphia at first i thought gomez took the scene from that real life event but then i realized that he made the film a few years before that situation i also agree with the point that this film didn't try to broaden its appeal by putting in hollywood crap gomez also directed laws of gravity i am eager to see it
