<START> my summary refers to the fact that this film has votes just 21 short of making it eligible to be on imdb's infamous bottom 100 list the 100 lowest rated films on the website with a paltry score of only 1 8 this would place the film at approximately between 38 and 46 on the list talk about a very dubious achievement my score of 3 isn't that bad but it does bring the film that much closer to the dreaded list br br as for the film it stars the once cute aaron carter yet another and forgettable pop star of the 1990s when he first broke onto the scene he was a cute kid with some songs that appealed to pre teens and tweeners on radio disney his songs look and image were all scrupulously groomed and created by marketing folks and did the trick leading to some huge album sales unfortunately by 2005 sales were in decline and carter had hit his awkward stage of life something all kids his age have to deal with eventually to put it bluntly he isn't cute any more in this film and is at a very tough stage of life i assume now he's a gorgeous young man but in popstar he's no longer the heart throb he once was here he is just very normal a death sentence for a kid in his position as a pop sensation br br interestingly the film has some appearances by some other ex teen heart throbs from the last few decades including a roles for david cassidy and leif garrett two guys who also know what it's like to disappear from the limelight cassidy managed to pick up the pieces and make a niche for himself while garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after stardom has been a bit of a joke hopefully carter will take after cassidy in the future and so far thankfully he's managed to avoid the negative publicity and court appearances of many ex pop idols i was far from thrilled with the film but seriously wish him best in this department it's not his fault he was plastered across the radio and television throughout the early to mid 1990s br br in this film carter doesn't exactly need to stretch himself he plays a pop star however despite making millions and being adored by girls he doesn't have it all he's quite dense mostly because he has little interest in learning the problem is so bad that his mother decides to no longer home school him forcing him to go to public school the problem though is that he is rather phobic about taking tests and making the grade in school is difficult so he gets the idea of finding a smart girl to date one who would naturally be obliged to help him out in school he picks the cute but bookish jane alana austin and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt to make this scheme work br br this plot by the way isn't bad and could work even though it seems a lot like an episode of a show like the brady bunch or a nickelodeon sit com sure it's predictable and you know that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn his plot and be hurt and he will eventually realize that he actually does care for her and by the end of the film all will be forgiven and they'll be a real couple but given good acting and competent direction this could be worth seeing for his teen fans as predictable isn't always bad and as it turned out this isn't exactly where the plot went but it was awfully close br br there are a few good things i liked about the film seeing tom bosley and stella stevens playing jane's grandparents was very nice their role was quite sweet and it was good seeing them again also 1970s made for tv movie star andrew stevens appeared in the film it was nice to see him again though part of me hated him as he looks so great after all these years and i look ever bit of my 45 years he did a fine job and it was nice seeing him in the same film as his mother stella br br as for carter with his many prior experiences on tv he was not surprisingly pretty good while his relationship with jane didn't seem very believable he and ms austin gave it their best the film wasn't great but they did try and i think most of the problems with the film were in the writing with a better and less formulaic plot it could have worked much better plus the whole angle seemed pretty contrived and rather insignificant who cares if a mega millionaire star gets anxious taking tests in school overall not a rotten film as the current rating would imply though there isn't much here to attract a wide audience people who grew up loving carter probably will enjoy the film older folks will probably care less as well as really young people who probably haven't heard of him for them there is no nostalgia value in the film br br my favorite part of the film leif garrett giving aaron advice i felt like screaming don't listen but didn't
<START> this was one of the most contrived tedious and clichÃ©d films i have ever seen and yes i've seen pearl harbour even the likes of gina mckee couldn't act their way out of the appalling dialogue it has been described as 'art house' this can only be a euphemism for dull dreadful and quite frankly artless why is it that when a film is devoid of plot critics feel it deserves to be called art but far more baffling why did america love it without you this film would have remained on the shelf where perhaps it belonged
<START> at last here's a movie that does as much for the reputations of the men of greece and russia as gigli did for the those of mr affleck and ms lo from the edge of the city details the sad and sordid lives of some young russian Ã©migrÃ©s who live in and around athens and spend their time burglarizing cars getting laid pimping woman Ã©migrÃ©s and prostituting themselves but we're not gay because we don't do you know and if we do it's only once or twice with the same guy there is hardly anything here you have not seen before and better only the athens locale adds a little novelty even then there's but a scene or two that's scenic writer director constantine 3 steps to heaven offer a relatively generic 95 minutes in which the standout moments involve how stupid sexist and from the looks of things pretty much irredeemable most of these guys are interestingly the gayer the guy the more redeemable he appears what really rankles is the treatment of the women greek and russian males would seem to give the italians a run for their money regarding that famous madonna whore complex has life in greece improved much for women since the time of plato and socrates one has to wonder br br if i seem to be equating russians and greeks in this review i apologize but even the non Ã©migrÃ©s pictured here the cab driver for instance are creeps according to another review on this site the film a hit on its home turf was actually submitted by greece for an academy award for best foreign film what this says about the state of greek movie making i hesitate to ponder
<START> i was very happy and at the same time quite surprised by other positive comments written by non koreans below this movie is amazingly and shows very 'sad but view toward life which is typical to korean people i thought other foreigners would not understand this delicate feeling and under rate this quiet film as a boring one but i was wrong the attraction of this film might be hard to avoid to foreigners too even without subtitle br br i would like to mention some points others have missed of course this film depicts love between a man and a woman however the very theme is way beyond that actually it is about time value of remembrance and death in this film the focus is not on the 'love affair' between two people as some pointed out they do not kiss they do not hug each other even without holding hands so love itself is not completed whether positively or negatively in the film rather what haunts a leading actor is his impending death he's running out of time he can't hold it leaving a few behind including his father and of course a so the problem is how he can face the death and leave something valuable in his short life not how he can make love with br br this kind of theme sounds very familiar to us there are lots of movies regarding patients with disease such as 'love story' however what makes this film outstanding is the way deals his death he is a loser but tried to do his best while he's alive in a silent way he does not tell anybody around him about his death he hides something in his mind but without rage hate vengeance he just tried to do best while he was alive this limited communication and obedience to fate is the typical mindset of koreans and the point most western people don't understand or at best misunderstand br br this theme is very effectively expressed by the director of this film surprisingly his debut some say he's much influenced by japanese director ozu yasujiro who directed tokyo story indeed i remember i read in some magazine that the director himself admitted he was influenced by ozu i'm not that to analyze his style comparing to ozu's but they have some in common and some not low angle and static camera especially remind us ozu's style but in terms of theme again this korean director seems to have somewhat warmer and hopeful vision br br it is expressed concisely with last photograph very well done and really heartbreaking scene i think actually the director first had the idea of this film when he participated the funeral of a very famous korean folk singer who died young of mysterious suicide they say he saw the photograph of the singer at the funeral and thought of a film on death and remembrance and possibly hope for the remnants i think br br i highly recommend this film to anybody who has deep interest in film art as well as korean culture this film in my opinion can be rivaled with other movies like tokyo story and a sort of american beauty it is that great if without language barrier dvd version is going to be out in the market this february so it might be a little help for foreigners with english subtitle
<START> sean bean returns as napoleonic hero richard sharpe in sharpe's honour the fifth movie in the series and as always patrick harper and the rest of chosen men are all along for the ride but this time major sharpe is in serious trouble br br under the influence of sharpe's sworn enemy major a mysterious lady by the name of la has accused sharpe of rape her husband arrives at sharpe's camp to challenge his wife's attacker to a dual br br the dual is discovered and stopped by the authorities and as a result sharpe becomes the prime suspect when his opponent is murdered in the middle of the night br br as no one in the british army other than wellington and major consider sharpe anything but a rough commoner with little or no honour he his given a shambolic trial and is sentenced to death by hanging and harper and the chosen men have no choice but to look on as their beloved commander walks slowly to the gallows br br however convinced of his innocence wellington and hang another convicted prisoner in sharpe's stead and release him and his chosen men to find the real killer and la herself to not only prove his innocence but to find out her reasons for framing him in the first place br br micheal byrne and hugh fraser co star with brilliant performances by alice krige as la and atkine as the villainous major in what is another exciting swashbuckling instalment through sharpe's eventful journey through the napoleonic wars
<START> this is a cut above other movies of the genre genuinely suspenseful intelligent brilliantly acted and visually stunning yes the plot can be confusing but that's partly what makes it pack such a punch watch it twice if you can you'll get almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time br br don't be put off by the fact that this film comes from korea a country not too familiar to most western audiences while there are elements of the film that are culturally specific the underlying themes are all too universal guilt anger loss madness and retribution all of these are handled superbly by lim su jeong as su mi the lead character also worthy of particular mention is yum jung ah who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother br br while it has its scary moments this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it it's more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery it grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end and possibly beyond
<START> this film has some nice special effects tearing apart the japanese archipelago to a degree that would humble godzilla the two leads also put in above par performances apart from that it is all a bit ropey in this understated disaster flick the incongruities in the pacing are bizarre at one point we have sinking into the sea and snow falling on the rest of japan while osaka is buried under an immense tsunami yet elsewhere in the country people are still strolling around sightseeing and licking ice cream when another tsunami rolls in also manages to travel great distances without any hindrance or even a in his cream shirt other people turn up with burns ripped clothes and mud streaks on their faces br br the of the film is both touching and repugnant sacrifice in his final evening with shibasaki is a touch of chivalry seldom seen in this genre these days however the ill fated pms musings on the japanese psyche and the seduction of death and the fact that japan is abandoned by everyone and has no friends in the last instance hint at a darker paranoia that infects japanese concerns regarding their status in the world br br sadly the final sequence is a rip off of edited with a cookie cutter br br finally my own particular bug bear the heavy handed product placement for cigarettes this time around it is mad or is he scientist who gets to be the poster boy for japan tobacco at one point he manages to light up 5000 meters below the ocean surface in a miniature sub the size of a phone box gimme a break
<START> i can't even describe it it's the worst movie i've ever seen i'm being a nice guy when i call it movie just another big budget made to someone who doesn't like to think much it's not even scary it's revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this thing to trick movie fans i guess big producers make whatever they want br br just get a big producer hot chicks allthough horrible actresses and a ton of horror movie clichÃ©s and cook it for a week or so and you'll get the nun br br and i thought bad boys 2 was horrible
<START> this is being commented on only because serge 1953 may not of known at first just how powerful a score and how actually majestic these lyrics really are if you read the lyrics to alexander nevsky op 78 there is nothing here that is less than a witness through the song to one of the most beautiful and moving scores in all of musical literature this film with its accompanying score have a special place in the world and that may be just as true on the internet as anywhere the composers own website which is underwritten by his estate provides for additional care given such a score as this score truly deserves it is to me as deep as it is wide with such boldness that you wish to be the one the one they called great this is a song about alexander nevsky yes it happened on the river neva on the river neva on the wide waters there we slew our of fighting men there pick of fighting men the army of swedes ah how we fought how we routed them ah smashed their ships of war to kindling in the fight our blood was freely shed for our great land our native russian land hey where the swung was as an open street through their ranks a lane where spears ran we mowed down the invading swedes like feather grass grown on desert soil we shall never yield native russian land they who march on russia shall be put to death rise against the foe russian land arise rise to arms great the call to arms goes on arise to arms ye russian folk in battle just in the fight to death arise ye people free and brave defend our fair native land to living warriors high esteem immortal fame to warriors slain for native home for russian soil arise ye people russian folk in our great native russia no foe shall live rise to arms arise native mother russia no foe shall march across russian land no foreign troops shall raid russia unseen are the ways to russia no foe shall ravage russian fields here dear reader we are asked to live forever with the following verse titled the field of the dead i shall go across the snow clad field i shall fly above the field of death i shall search for valiant warriors my betrothed my stalwart youths here lies one felled by a wild saber there lies one impaled by an arrow from their wounds blood fell like rain on our native soil on our russian fields he who fell for russia in noble death shall be by my kiss on his dead eyes and to him brave lad who remained alive i shall be a true wife and a loving friend i'll not be wed to a handsome man earthly charm and beauty fast fade and die i'll be wed to the man who's brave give ye heed to this brave warriors now to its conclusion with entry into in a great campaign russia went to war russia put down the hostile troops in our native land no foe shall live foes who come shall be put to death celebrate and sing native mother russia in our native land foe men shall not live foes shall never see russian towns and fields they who march on russia shall be put to death in our russia great in our native russia no foe shall live celebrate and sing native mother russia all of russia came in triumph to the celebration celebrate and rejoice russian motherland it should be noted that was under quite a bit of pressure from stalin to if you will make good this musical score was really very much approved of by stalin to me there is a unmistakable beauty in how we love this world and nevsky tells of a hero whose god like attributes provides for all participation in that love a truly beautiful and furtive telling of the story of alexander nevsky
<START> used this documentary to push a stereotype of punks this documentary is biased and guided not objective the cutting techniques that jump from interview to interview may be used to take the spoken word of interviewees out of context when you watch the film the sticking idea that comes from the interviews of the punks is that they are pretty dumb band members and other punks seem to be of low intelligence and unable to explain their motives or give detailed or coherent answers or even answers at all i highly doubt that if some of those who were interviewed knew what was creating or saw the final product would allow themselves to be included in the project this film puts punks in a bad light by making them seem unintelligent and simple minded film should not be taken as a representation of the l a punk scene if you want to see a good punk documentary watch another state of mind featuring youth brigade and social distortion
<START> its perhaps unfair of me to comment on this film because for the first time ever i switched off a movie because it was so bad i can watch anything but this movie was so very boring i was bored before i put on the dvd and thought this might be a laughable action horror action movie to lighten the mood it is not even that it is a device which increases the level of boredom by the power of 100 had to switch it off after 45 minutes because all that had happened in that time was some people had been scuba diving and a big mole had been discovered seriously this movie is not worth the time even if you can enjoy a bad movie like i can avoid this film like the plague worst thing i have seen in years
<START> stylized hollywood westerns full of familiar conventions seem to have eternal life and this is an avatar everything in it seems to have been scraped out of the back of a drawer from 1939 a larger budget applied and this production its issue br br gary cooper has played this sort of role dozens of times the displaced southerner fast on the draw and firm with honor though kinda easy going whenever possible he plays hollister who travels to texas looking for the gang who destroyed his cotton plantation he wears a shirt and packs two ivory handled six shooters he speaks with a accent a could get hurt doin' this cf sergeant york the gang is led by sneering raymond massey who buys and sells land usually by underhanded means whenever possible the gang includes steve cochran who cannot play a westerner though he's very good at scum bags in general the requisite woman is ruth roman daughter of the mexican plantation owner who looks and speaks about as mexican as a boston brown betty br br i don't think i'll bother too much with the plot no doubt someone has gone into it in some detail and it's not worth much more mention as in any 1939 western it's labyrinthine everyone except cooper and his friends are underhanded and there are multiple double crosses and switched identities and hidden secrets br br everything is retro the plot the dialog the wardrobe even the music the score is by warner's stalwart max steiner he's the guy that scored king kong that was 1932 this movie was released in 1950 br br cooper's name by the way hollister prompted me to look through the records of the the real american cowboy to see if that name cropped up in their archives which date from the beginning of time to february 4th 1911 when the last real cowboy passed away due to an unfortunate encounter with a deranged there has never been a real cowboy with the name hollister yes but not as a matter of fact there is no record of any real cowboy named wade luke cole or matt either the most popular names for genuine cowboys in descending order of frequency were clarence mortimer noble and hortense br br if this movie had been released in 1939 it would have been routine in 1950 it is a calamitous monument in the history of human recycling
<START> based on stephen hawking's a brief history of time this amazing film by morris documents the the life and work of one of the greatest minds in the history of astronomy he has contributed more to science despite his debilitating disease als than an able bodied scientist could only dream of br br the film begins by telling of hawking's childhood and how he was a poor student that was recognizably bright he slacked his way through college and university where he was diagnosed with the disease that would take away normal functions of his body but would allow him to continue living and thinking perfectly br br morris discusses how the brilliant mind of stephen developed from childhood to the present at one point his mother tells how when she was pregnant she bought a astronomical atlas to read while in the hospital hawking himself narrates the timeline of his discoveries while morris interviews close friends and colleagues whom have been lucky enough to befriend the magnificent man br br he tells how he was first intrigued by the discovery that the universe was expanding similar to how a star would expand we also know that stars eventually die and become what is now known as black holes if this is the case will the universe not too begin to contract reversing itself until we reach the big crunch as hawking puts it and when the universe does begin to will time not reverse when posed this question i began to think that death may not be the end perhaps one day time will go backwards and our death will become our rebirth and our birth our death the universe is one big cycle just like everything else in life br br this is what hawking is telling us everything in the universe recycles itself this is completely logical and can make your mind wonder in a million directions pondering it this is why i love this film and why it is a must see an 11 out of 10 morris never ceases
<START> i really tried to give this film a chance but when i realized that most of the film was being told by a bunch of boring officials walking around and talking on phones i knew it was over a lot of this film also looked like stock footage that's just lame br br the camera person kept like doing these quick short zooms for no reason it bothered me so much but i was just wondering why in the heck did they think it was a good idea it doesn't add anything to a static scene of two people talking this isn't nypd blue or some cop show or something br br how could they have not realized that telling this type a story from conversations of people in conference rooms and what not is boring did they not watch this mess anyway this was just a really boring movie and it does make it seem like whoever made it doesn't understand good storytelling in film br br darn stock footage that's just wrong
<START> is it just me or is this an awful film i'm going with it's an awful film br br knowing full well that it's a guy flick usually defined as full of car chases crashes gunfights explosions etc i still expect some small degree of credibility if i can't somehow believe in the premise the film will not work thus we come to the problem with assault on precinct 13 br br not one for spoilers i never report details of the plot however i will make an exception here because the plot is so inane bad guy is jailed in precinct 13 bad guy's buddies want to bust him out surprise the bad guys' buddies are actually corrupt cops brooding troubled but heroic young cop saves the day while romancing the girl ugh yes it really is that simple and that dumb br br assault on precinct 13 takes place in detroit not a bad setting for crime and corruption i spent 3 months there in late 2004 so i know what i'm talking about even so it's outrageously violent and insulting to the police and the citizens of detroit i have spent a lot of time in downtown detroit but i cannot imagine how the final chase wound up in the downtown detroit forest i must have missed it br br there are no refunds for watching bad movies save your money there were too many good films in 2005 to waste even 3 00 at blockbuster on this one br br final rating 1 br br only because i have seen worse films
