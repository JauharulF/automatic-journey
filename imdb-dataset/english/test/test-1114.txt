<START> i was very impressed with what eddie monroe was able to accomplish in regards to its overall affect on me i say this because i know this independent film had a limited budget resources but despite this it comes across as a convincing and well crafted piece of work br br enjoyable from start to finish with several relatively unknown actors which i can't help but believe will make a big noise in the industry in years to come eddie monroe didn't fail to keep my interest engaged and my emotional meter dancing it's a well scripted story with a startling ending despite my effort to not be taken off guard br br many of the cast names listed for this film are names to look out for in the future someone told me that paul regina recently passed and if this is true it's a real tragedy since his stoic performance in eddie monroe is remarkable br br kudos to fred carpenter who has truly pulled out a winner with this one
<START> this has to be one of my 3 favorite episodes from the original tv series br br what makes it great is the battle of wits between the commander and kirk as well as the top notch acting from mark who later went on to play spock's father in other tv episodes and movies this is a case where those around rose to the level of the talent around them and shatner nimoy and the whole cast deliver an outstanding performance in this episode br br the writing and plot are also excellent and i love the direct approach used to show us the characters and the feelings and thoughts of those characters and how freely they are expressed by the actors br br this very entertaining episode ranks 10 out of 10 awesome desert buddha
<START> john carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could the only difference here is that carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of john w campbell jr's short story the secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold carpenter manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery needed to keep the film heading in the right direction be it an horrific scene or a what is in the shadow sequence the film to me is a perfect fusion of horror and sci fi the dialogue is spot on for a group of men trying to keep it together under duress and carpenter's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia thru the film the cast are superb a solid assembly of actors led by carpenter fave kurt russell whilst the effects used give the right amount of impact needed but most of all it's the ending that is the crowning glory an ending that doesn't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it lets wait and see what happens indeed 10 10
<START> this is the first movie i've seen from singapore and it's great if you don't know a lot about asia its languages and its culture then this film may be a bit confusing for the non informed people as an asian american who's double in two asian languages one of them being mandarin and has taken some asian american studies classes this film was easier for me to understand but even without that kind of knowledge i believe this movie is still accessible to its foreign audiences as long as you keep in mind that it's a coming of age type of movie the film is definitely worth seeing just so that you get the chance to see what kind of issues young teenage boys are struggling and having to deal with this is an awesome coming of age movie but filmed and shown in a more artistic and original way the actors are outstanding
<START> truly a great film i stumbled onto it at the video store and rented it because aaron in the company of men and your friends and neighbors was in it as well as the lovely former si swimsuit model does get nude in the film but that is only one of the many reasons to rent it it's very exciting and the character development is fantastic is one of the most underrated actors working and he steals this film it is very dark and violent but i enjoyed in immensely
<START> the people who bash this movie were looking for it to be as cool and slick as the first one which this isn't this movie was supposed to be the complete opposite as ocean's 11 this has been said by a lot of the cast members and also the director steven soderbergh ocean's 12 while it did lack a gripping plot is being bashed because it was different then what people wanted if it were released before ocean's 11 it would be taken much differently not as a failed sequel the problem with sequels is people go into it with a preset idea of what it should be like it and have lots of expectations they should go into this movie with an open mind and not expect it to be ocean's 11 again
<START> the seven collaborations between director joseph von sternberg and star marlene dietrich were so distinct in look and tone and so different from anything else going on at the time they almost seem to constitute a sub genre of their own like any genre they have their outright masterpieces as well as their absolute turkeys time to send blonde venus back to the farm br br after the seductive hits the blue angel morocco and shanghai express in which miss dietrich established her screen image as cabaret singer cum prostitute someone at paramount decided it was time for marlene to play a mother there is nothing wrong with that in itself as an actress she was up to the part it's just that nothing else about the format has changed it's like the blue angel plus a kid fair enough the story of a woman who drags her child along on her sleazy escapades is a sound premise for a tragic drama but that's not the way this is played dietrich's journey is played as some kind of adventure using her wits and accomplices to stay ahead of the law this is not some cheeky example of pre code Â it is just bizarrely distasteful br br although we may be able to accept marlene is a doting mommy there is absolutely no way we can buy sternberg as a director of warmth and poignancy in spite of this being one of the handful of pictures for which he also took a writing credit sternberg simply fails to get the story arc the film's emotional payoff is supposed to be the eventual reunion of the family but even at the beginning this is not established as something worth getting back to as usual interiors are dressed and shot to look like either brothels or insane asylums the home is actually quite a creepy dingy environment and it's a wonder little johnny wasn't wetting the bed and asking to sleep with the light on br br but as anyone familiar with them will know the point of a dietrich sternberg picture is to make dietrich look fabulous and in this respect at least blonde venus is a success marlene is introduced emerging from a forest pool in a bright shimmering close up and even when she is reduced to rags the camera still loves her the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast whom sternberg tended to view as mobile pieces of scenery the normally likable herbert marshall is here reduced to a moody grouch lurking in the shadows even the suave and lively cary grant becomes just a boring background blob and does not seem nearly interesting enough for dietrich to run off with br br the only standout moments in blonde venus are song and dance routines especially the renowned hot voodoo number where she parodies her own surreal stage persona by emerging from a gorilla outfit but even these feel like they have been cut and pasted from a different film fans may hail it as another masterpiece as they are wont to do but for the average punter it is a massive disappointment audiences of the time did not lap it up as they had her earlier hits and this heralded the beginning of the end for heyday a year later there would be a new queen at paramount Â mae west
<START> 20 people rated this a 10 that ballot box was stuffed better than a christmas turkey speaking of here's a traditional story hoping to piggy back on the current poker craze without success told entirely in linear flashback and when i say told i mean talked to death this film never let's a picture suffice when words can be used to br br stu childhood fascination with cards and his associations with hoodlums might sound like interesting movie material but the director manages to suck the life out of them at no point did i feel the least bit of sympathy for unger a genius at cards who threw it all away on other forms of gambling at which he was not so proficient of course this leads as we wade through three musical montages to the inevitable downward spiral of drugs loss of family and finally his redemption sort of big yawn
<START> i like kevin bacon and cathy moriarty and i love mary stuart masterson but the movie wasn't good at all there wasn't a likable character in the picture and the plot was nearly non existent br br ms masterson is a great actress but she just didn't pull off the tough girl character she had similar problems with her character in the second day of christmas perhaps she should avoid these characters especially those with an obnoxious female child to play off of br br evan rachel wood was unimpressive her character was a brat plain and simple and no young actress could have given harriet any positive feelings br br in the interest of full disclosure i couldn't even finish watching this picture forty five minutes of my time is enough to waste
<START> ross hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy based on james hilton's enduring bestseller was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973 sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in hollywood for years group of disparate british and american individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war torn asian country but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called shangri la where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content some of the performances by the classy cast aren't so classy the effervescent mood of the piece the lilting burt bacharach hal david tunes as well as the lightweight direction all conspire to make the performers look just a bit silly peter finch is the international peace keeper who becomes involved in a somewhat constipated romance with resident liv sally kellerman is a malcontent who spits out lines like i got tired of taking pictures of people with their heads blown off so that people with their heads still on and usually under could get one last kick before turning to the latest recipe john as chang an asian who learned to speak english while attending oxford is humorously self amused but why no songs for chang hal david's dopey lyrics are sometimes jaw dropping on the good ship lollipop how did christopher columbus sail across the sea and the pacing gets bogged down with all that chatter about the outside world and how nothing is more pitiful today however the production is lush and the general handling strangely affecting the two dimensional characters are so overly serious they actually become endearing and the movie's silliness is infectious it ends up being a lot of fun from
<START> why didn't critics like this movie i don't get it this is easily my favorite clive barker effort hellraiser is a bit too rough around the edges the film just never leaves that stupid house and lets face it lord of illusions doesn't move at all i have loved barker's writing for years especially his books of blood terrifically entertaining he has a vicious side to him that is totally unlike a stephen king he freely mixes in his own homosexuality and odd religious and elements i love love love love it i also realize however that barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as he is a horror writer and fantasy just isn't my bag puts me right to sleep always has i also think barker works best with short stories his novels tend to wander a bit that was my experience when trying to read the damnation game it started out well then 100 pages in i thought where is this going because it wasn't going anywhere br br i read cabal the book was based on and thought it was good i especially like the elaboration on character the way the mask talked to him and controlled him i like the way barker simply presents it black and white there it is he gives it a simplicity that's attractive and believable when asked why decker kills he says simply because i like it probably something jeffrey dahmer said at some point br br but i actually liked the film better than cabal i adore the visual attention to detail that barker gives to his films adore it i think it is just beautiful lord of illusions had some of this as well some of the drawings in the beginning during the credit sequence it's like an entire vocabulary barker dreamed up just for the world i'd be curious to know how much was purely his design i know he is an amazing artist who his own style and language as an artist br br is also i think barker's most entertaining film it moves very quickly well edited it doesn't drag like lord of illusions does a little bit very quick everything in it is just perfect it also works as a fantastic and scary little slasher movie the stuff with the killer in the beginning killing the family and later tormenting the old man in the shop is really scary stuff that mask is frightening i'd be curious to know if barker designed that as well it's not just a hokey jason or scream type mask something about it is really disturbing br br anyway this is a great flick definitely check it out if you haven't seen it highly recommended one of my favorite horror films of all time in my opinion clive barker's best it is scary and violent though be warned
<START> barbet murder by numbers starring sandra bullock is solid work though not particularly compelling i am a big sandra bullock fan and she is effective here as forensic detective cassie mayweather who is not very likable and a broken person too however there is a sense of detachment inherent in the story structure it's about the perfect murder executed by two spoiled sociopath teenagers richard ryan who is the cool one and justin michael pitt who is the sympathetic geek basically richard and justin kill a young woman because they have nothing better to do on a school night they are very smart and very arrogant which is normally not a bad thing but it just doesn't work here tony script does a great job of detailing the investigation of a puzzling murder and it is truly by the numbers we have these two punk kids flaunting their superiority and we just want them to take a fall br br this is not a great exploration into the dark side like reversal of fortune about claus von bulow there are interesting turns in numbers the movie is not so much a thriller but rather a character study of cassie sandra bullock balances the bravado of cassie her fear of letting people get in with her and her secret past bullock brings courage and strength to a suffering character her partner and sort of love interest sam played by ben chaplin is more a plot than a real character though chaplin does the bewilderment thing very admirably the other nice touch is having richard and justin involved a strange sexual attraction the most interesting thing about numbers are pitt and br br there are many entertaining twists and turns throughout the movie everything is done very competently i saw the movie about a week ago and in retrospect i like it a little more than i did when i saw it however it is just not inspired work sandra bullock and barbet schroeder deserve a lot better and so do we
<START> i rented this movie hoping that it would provide some good entertainment and some cool poker knowledge or stories what i got was a documentary type look at an average guys life who happened to be really good at cards do i want to see the romance with his wife no do i want to see about everything that went on in this guy's life except poker no well thats what you get with this film the acting is good for such a low budget piece of crap the film never tries to break the mold or do anything original it simply sleep walks its way through the script the ending is disappointing and never really looks deep into mind instead it focuses on what was already obvious he was a drugged out card player with an average life not unlike any other average joe in vegas the movie focuses on the aspects of his life that were un extraordinary rather than the extraordinary the poker scenes in the entire film add up to about 4 minutes of footage achievements of winning the 3 times seem life after thoughts a 10 year old could do a better job directing this movie or maybe it was the script being a piece of crap from the beginning that doomed this joke of a movie br br if you want to see a film about gambling watch rounders it at least has style
<START> 'thriller' remains the greatest of the pop music promos to have a plot great visuals and a tip top song to wrap the film around michael jackson was at the top of the tree at this time and not so altered in his plastic surgery regime for it to matter here he is in good form the song is terrific he leads the zombies in dance like no other br br ola ray plays the girl who watches with incredulity as her sweet boyfriend jackson natch turns into a werewolf then to the pulsing rhythms of the opening line 'it's close to he stomps around the graveyard with the other zombies and creatures of the night br br the crowning glory of all this is the fruity voice of the great horror star vincent price speaking in the middle of the record terrific
<START> reeves plays haji a hero in russia br br this is a badly dubbed movie with june foray doing some of the voices unfortunately who ever was suppose to sync the voices to the lips was blind since the words never match the lip flaps anyone who says that japanese films are bad have never watched this film br br the film's plot is instantly forgettable and so i've forgotten it in the time its taken the movie to end and for me to sit and write this down perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the film is one of the many that reeves made in hopes of moving away from action to more plot driven sort of films it may have been a good thing for reeves but its deadly for the audience who have to slug through fests such as this where its all court intrigue with very little action br br in reeves defense he was a good actor he just had no real luck in picking films that were any good they all looked great but very few of them didn't put the those watching them into a coma for the film's running time br br this film will put you in a coma watch it only if you have the need for sleep and all other gentler means have failed
