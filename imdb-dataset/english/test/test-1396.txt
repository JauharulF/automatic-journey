<START> what a disaster normally when one critiques a historical movie it's always fun to point out the inaccuracies that slip in usually added by the writers to create more dramatic situations however is a whole kind of animal in this movie you strain to find anything at all that is confirmed by the historical record amidst the farrago of nonsense and fiction presented as the life of bad boy artist emperor br br and it's a pity because nero is one of the most fascinating of all the roman his life was filled with enough tumultuous events and interesting people to make a really good movie the producers of this mess chose another route which leads only to head scratching on the part of any informed viewer br br just a few examples br br 1 nero is depicted as an 6 8 year old boy when caligula has his father killed for treason his mother and sends the boy to be raised by slaves in the countryside ten years later the story resumes just before the assassination of caligula facts nero was born about six months after caligula began his four year reign and was only three when he was assassinated nero's father died of natural causes was briefly exiled for bad behavior not treason and nero was not raised among slaves but had the typical upbringing of a young member of the imperial family br br 2 okay according to the writers nero is now about 16 when his great uncle claudius becomes emperor in fact he was about to turn 4 engineers the downfall of the empress and marries claudius who adopts nero then he goes off to conquer britain and is poisoned by soon after his victorious return nero is declared emperor although he's still perhaps only 18 or 19 years old fact claudius conquered britain in 43 a d two years after beginning his reign he lived until 54 a d nero should have been 31 years old by then by any normal chronology but in fact succeeded to the throne at age 16 br br history tells us that there then followed the five good years where nero ruled wisely and well under the tutelage of the philosopher and the commander this is shown sort of except that portraying the roman senate as opposing nero's good measures is false opposition to nero only commenced when he started to show signs of insanity and began killing senators for real or imagined treason br br 3 nero's mother is the controlling sort who murdered her uncle husband to make her son emperor after a while nero tires of her meddling and decides to kill her in the movie he sends his henchman to stab her to death all true enough but the reality was so much better was a survivor and didn't go easily nero tried three times to poison her but as an old poisoner herself she was savvy to all that and he failed then he tried to crush her to death by collapsing the ceiling of her bedchamber but that also failed next he sent her on a voyage on a ship that was deliberately constructed to fall apart and sink as it went down she jumped into the sea and swam to shore finally he had her stabbed to death now showing all that would have definitely improved this movie br br other errors abound nero's lover was not a childhood slave friend she never repudiated him and there is no evidence that she became a christian nero did not commit suicide by slitting his wrists while sitting beside a lake etc etc etc br br the sources for nero's life are primarily the roman historians and both of whom were of the class hostile to him and his memory but the evidence indicates that he remained very popular with the common people unlike one of the final scenes where he is pelted by the mob with vegetables as he leaves the city to commit suicide br br why did the writers and producers take an inherently interesting story with plenty of good stuff for any movie and make this piece of crap oh and did i mention how cheesy the sets and costumes were lol br br one star because there's no way to rate it lower
<START> this is a prime example of uninhibited filmmaking at its best richard greene who does good in the role search for his two missing friends takes him to the black forest domain and castle of one eyed count bruno stephen mcnally a past enemy of his whom he has never seen face to face incredible film has so many awesome elements combined for once into a single film a crocodile pit a hulking mute played by lon chaney jr a crafty doctor played by boris karloff a leopard hunt very well done and very atmospheric a love story a castle a swordfight a sadistic one eyed count and his two evil accomplices played by john hoyt and michael pate an intriguing background story which makes the film even more interesting and more jerry script doesn't allow itself to be bound in making a film that comes extremely recommendable to anyone who is into unlimited filmmaking with a touch of horror and atmosphere to it
<START> the deer hunter's success with critics and publics alike led united artists to give cimino carte blanche on heaven's gate an epic western about the 1892 johnson county warsÂ br br the elliptical story about the persecution of lowly european born farmers by cattle was a muddled mixture of class conflict sumptuous pageant and underwritten stereotypical however cimino's fetish for authenticity and his sweeping sense of scale ensured that the film running at nearly four hours Â was rarely br br its undeserved status as a cause with critics divided as to whether it was a masterpiece or a fiasco derived from its inflated blamed for the studio's financial problems cimino became a scapegoat for hollywood's general decline and the film edited into an incomprehensible short version after its initial release was a commercial
<START> i've seen this amusing little times the only problem is its currently unavailable on video or dvd i'ts certainly a contender for a dvd release the much missed richard jordan plays an ex pat american whose just been released from prison he finds himself a job as an electrician in a bank it all goes well until he finds himself embroiled in a bank heist with his ex cronies david niven plays the mastermind ivan its an enjoyable little romp hopefully studio canal or anchor bay will come to the rescue look out for john rhys davies before he struck it big with raiders of the lost ark 'lord of the rings' in a small role as a barrister
<START> john wayne is without a doubt one of the most popular and loved actors of all time his career stretched over forty years and within that time he starred in films such as angel and the badman the green berets sands of iwo jima rio bravo north to alaska and the undefeated br br the film's listed above are hailed as some of his best unlike this 1934 effort randy rides alone which has been pretty much forgotten about as time's gone on which is unsurprising as it's nothing memorable apart from its very short running time of just 53 minutes br br a young john wayne plays randy bowers who for reasons never really explained arrives at a saloon in the middle of nowhere and finds that everyone inside has been killed while looking around a posse arrives and finds randy there and they arrest him accusing him of being a gang member and demand to know where the rest of his gang is he is put in jail accused of the murders sally rogers whose uncle owned the saloon and was murdered arrives at the jail to see randy in order to clarify that he was one of the gang members she was hiding in a secret room when the shooting took place sally doesn't believe that randy is a killer and doesn't recognise him so while the sheriff is out she slips him the keys and randy escapes while running away from the sheriff and his posse randy conveniently stumbles into the gang's hideout in a cave who were responsible for the murders randy sets out to clear his name and also to bring the gang to justice br br randy rides alone can be a fun film to watch especially if you're a john wayne fan but at the same time it has far too many flaws that are impossible to ignore the film is also extremely dated as you would expect we have the terrible camera shooting which makes everyone look like they are moving in super fast motion and the dialogue is terrible the acting isn't great either and wayne's character is very wooden and he along with the rest of the cast look like wooden puppets who are being conducted by someone in this case it's by director harry fraser harry fraser is at the helm and does a good enough job but the story is paper thin one can't help but feel that about ten minutes is missing from the start of the film as randy just arrives out of nowhere at the saloon and is looking to meet someone an explanation on why randy was there is giving later on which turns out to be something like he is a p i who was sent to investigate the claims that someone is trying to take over the town to be honest i didn't really pick it up most of the time i was hoping for the movie to end br br but that being said i didn't find this film to be completely terrible i enjoyed some of it and found it to be quite fun at times but it really isn't a great film and isn't really worth watching or tracking down br br overall randy rides alone is incredibly dated and is a tiresome western with very few redeeming qualities can be fun but overall it isn't a great movie and is certainly one of wayne's weaker outings
<START> there are three main problems with the film or rather there are three reasons why it isn't even a contender worthy of more serious consideration br br firstly and this was always going to be true it's not nearly as good as the books however at least we could have expected to reflect some of the wit or depth br br secondly we have the production fantasy movies are in my opinion the hardest to produce well everything from the props through costumes scenery stunts and especially cgi is substandard br br finally and this is many be very subjective i just can't quite take the acting seriously i wasn't brought up in poland so i can't really judge it may me my lack of familiarity with films in polish all the same the lines seem very amateurishly delivered the casting could be better as well br br in summation the only possible redeeming feature of this film is the remainder of the plot shining through not unlike a diamond ring on a rotting cadaver br br on a separate note i heard that the books are coming out in english i haven't seen them yet but i can't imagine how one would even begin to translate them i would ask the english speaking reader to bare this in mind when judging the book
<START> an interesting movie based on three of jules verne's novels considering the special effects and computer enhanced animation of today this movie stands as an historic marker of cinematic resourcefulness and imagination karel zeman has brought to life the images of the original jules verne texts this is a must see for classic science fiction and history buffs br br i give this movie 9 out of 10 enjoy
<START> the original road house was a classic cheesy 80s movie which although it didn't have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting was a very enjoyable and popular film largely due to the presence of star patrick swayze and the great supporting cast along with some excellent fight scenes and eye candy br br 16 years later and mgm sony attempts to re create the magic which left us all quoting one liners and reciting the three rules of bouncing with a movie which quotes all the original's best one liners and recites the three rules br br were this an amateur fan made film it would be seen as a loving homage to one of the most popular of swayze's movies as a professionally made film it falls flat on it's face right into the dvd bargin bin with its continual reuse of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than cool references to the original br br having said that with new lines such as i'm gonna kill you just like i killed your father no wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original script br br i knew this was never going to be anything special being a straight to dvd sequel but i had at least hoped that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh things included to live up to the road house name but what you get is simply just a 2006 remake of the same film with a little narcotics added in br br were i the director i'd have removed all references to the first film so as not to tarnish the original and it's characters as it is we got patrick swayze's character now supposed to be dead killed off screen in a lame way by jake busey and his brother and son now the main characters who strangely enough have completely different surnames br br my favourite part was that dalton's 'son' drove the same car his father did a genuinely cool homage although it was later ruined by having the car meet its end exactly the same way as its predecessor did that's a good example of how this film goes too far in including sequences and ideas from the '89 movie br br also of course who can forget the legendary moment where wild bill promises to kill shane just like i killed your father and then proceeds to attempt to dispatch him in a completely different manner amazing writing there i see schaech is listed as co screenwriter stick to acting or preferably nothing br br overall though this is an ok film if there's nothing else to watch and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and a half or if you haven't seen the first road house but hardcore fans of swayze's classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the first as someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film even jeff healy is glad he won't be seeing this one stick to the original road house and relive the good old swayze days
<START> trying hard to fit into the scary space comedy genre this film falls down in two of these it does indeed take place in space but it is neither funny or scary the plot is dismal and the one joke concerning the intellect is overplayed to death saying that paul as ethan angela bassett as fran and brad dourif as al bert make the best of their ham script the homo esque relationship between ethan and al bert is hinted at but never explored whilst the attempt at sexual tension fran and rick is so crude as to be laughable all in all this is a turkey that is best suited to late night tv preferably whilst do the ironing
<START> wow pretty amazing that something this bad could actually be made i am giving this movie a 2 because it is so bad it has a certain car wreck kind of appeal its so bad its comical and that does have a certain entertainment value plus there is a bit of gratuitous nudity and that is always appreciated br br so where do i begin the acting is beyond awful its like you are watching a high school play being filmed theresa russell must have done something really bad to have been forced to make this movie and her acting reflects how happy she is to be in the middle of this mess br br the rest of the cast is simply silly with the casting of dan cortese as an fbi agent the cherry on the top of this piece of crap his acting actually had me laughing at loud br br as for the screenplay and the directing c courtney joyner and mark l lester should simply be taken out back and shot
<START> human traffic is a view into an average weekend for a group of friends it is a fly on the wall view into their lives and minds which will show you how this group of friends relate to each other there are many moments in that every one can relate to like being out of you skull at parties and talking complete rubbish to strangers the characters are all people that you can relate to and they are believable in the roles that they play in the movie the situations that they are in are all situations that we all have found ourselves in and that is where this film succeeds the topics of sex and drugs are handled superbly as to no get in the way of the characters relationships with each other the story to the film is not all that but that is not a criticism this is a film about people this is a well written film with a sound track to die for d j's pete tong has put together an superb selection of tracks for this file which all goes to make this one of the best films that i have seen in 1999 after watching this film i felt like i had been out partying all weekend fantastic movie jo brand as the voice of reality need i say more br br
<START> a tedious yawn of a film that retains nothing of the zing and of its predecessor gold diggers of 1933 the production code was firmly in place by the time of this film's release so the humour is all of the hokey variety and gone are the dry one liners that sounded so cosmopolitan dripping off the lips of the gorgeous dames from the first film a cast of second tier stars and character actors go through the motions here and the on a show motif seems awfully forced instead of the make or break world of broadway the show here is a charity event hosted by a swanky hotel who really cares whether or not the show goes on the score here is bland too of course the movie's big number is lullaby of broadway which accompanies a long fantasy dance number about a new york eventual demise from too much partying doesn't exactly have the same effect as the searing forgotten man number used as the finale in busby berkeley directs as well as choreographs this film and whatever promise is built up in the film's fluid opening scenes quickly deteriorates unfortunately no one learned any lessons from this and there was yet another gold diggers movie two years later br br grade c
<START> with an interesting premise in the conflicts between europeans and indigenous peoples sometimes the battle lines were not so clear this should have been a good film but the story is sabotaged by the director's overriding infatuation with his own cleverness twinned with a very poor script br br yes the natural setting is beautiful and yes the movie is authentic to its 19th century historical setting but the filmmaker keeps gilding the lily over and over again adding layer upon layer of over the top musical accompaniment not to mention a completely unnecessary voice over to the soundtrack that ultimately overwhelm the viewer and by calling attention to themselves take away from the story br br to me it was clear the director with his microscopic closeups and the endless of the musical motif of danny boy of all things was trying to make a new zealand version of an epic sergio leone film something on the order of once upon a time in the west but given the earnestness of the story most of leone's westerns were tongue in cheek not to mention that it's no longer 1968 he succeeds in making a parody of one br br too bad
<START> from troma which is my favorite movie company is a messy horror film that can be interesting but very dark and twisted br br unspeakable starts with a family in a car they get into an accident which leaves a daughter dead and a mother deformed the father eventually goes crazy and slashes prostitutes he sees his daughter in other people he kills for her meanwhile his now deformed wife is being raped by her orderly these are sick people br br unspeakable tries to be sick and disturbing and it does manage to do that as a good horror flick this is not most troma movies have a sense of humor to them but however this one doesn't
<START> i rented this movie after hearing chris gore saying something to the effect of five stars on that attack of the show show well when i turned around the dvd and it showed the 3 stages of hell well i had to buy it just to see the spectacle of a mother yelling at her son to drop her other son into a flaming pit br br i wasn't expecting ecw or for an hour and eighteen minutes but i was expecting at least a summarized version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this movie well sadly there wasn't anything like that the 3 stages of death part happens right from the beginning and its pretty much downhill from there nothing really happens in this documentary it was pretty raw bare and unbiased not a bad thing but there is a narrator in this one you'd expect him to have opinions on the subject of this documentary but he doesn't which would of been nice to have a message or reason for this doc there was no real reason to have a narrator there should of been just text explaining some of the less obvious scenes br br it doesn't really explain the lives of these wrestlers either it shows a few moments of some dramatic scenes which sound interesting but the reality isn't as great as it sounds for instance mom watching her son wrestle with light bulbs and tacks for the first time at a public park instead of seeing her reaction to the wrestling they show her reacting to the camera instead of say a interview later on or just actually witnessing her reactions br br document wise this one ain't the source material was flimsy to begin with nothing truly profound or interesting really happens no conclusion to a few of the more interesting stories no real point or final thought to backyard wrestling edited together badly and its and its basically a cheap failed rip off of beyond the mat br br wrestling wise this is pretty boring the better bumps are at the beginning and slowly become less amazing and shocking if you have seen japanese wrestling indie wrestling or even backyard wrestling dvds than this wont shock and awe you if you want wrestling don't make the same mistake i did and see this one go get some ecw or dvds instead br br the only thing i got out of this documentary was how stupid people can be not for supporting self mutilation or doing dangerous stunts but their reasoning for committing these acts the seem stupid for wrestling most of them are jobless and probably have a few issues in their head and wrestling is a type of therapy for them than the supporters seem even more idiotic mothers basically take the whole if ya cant beat em join em reasoning to cope with the fact that their sons are basically killing themselves school authority figures support their students in their dangerous stunts because its an alternative to joining gangs and to a lesser extend doing drugs which is kinda funny since that segment took place in a rural town where like people live 20 miles from one another people are stupid thats what i extracted from this documentary br br if you want to see the reasoning and thoughts to someone brutalizing themselves in wrestling and basically what the back of this dvd promises get the life of nick mondo its more amazing and interesting than the backyard and a lot more entertaining oh and its actually good
