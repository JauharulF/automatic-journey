<START> i know that the original psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake especially a shot by shot remake i think that that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here but there's far more wrong with this movie than just that br br the first problem is the color the original film was shot in black and white but what few people realize is the original was shot after color film had been invented the choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern but it was also a stylistic choice of hitchcock's now this is not to say that the remake should have been redone in black and white but the colors of this movie are all too wrong the most predominant colors in the film are orange and green particularly on marion who is not supposed to be a flashy character the bright colors make it look like a happy movie and when horrific events take place in these color schemes it looks like a cartoon more than anything and the audience is inclined to laugh rather than scream br br the second problem is the lighting this is a dark dark tale which should be highlighted by dim lighting but this remake seemed not only to fail in this but seemed to go in the opposite direction most of the scenes are very brightly lit even at times when it is illogical to do so because it's at night br br another obvious problem is vince vaughn's performance yes he does pull off norman awkwardness and madness quite well i don't deny him that but there is one element to the character that he failed to show the softness there should be a certain deceptive friendliness to the character at least at first which then fades away once we realize the truth about him beyond being a character trait of norman bates this is a recognized character trait of all psychopaths br br there are a few good aspects of this film some of the performances are great as i said vince vaughn came very close to pulling off a decent portrayal of norman bates viggo mortensen and juliane moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original which was a welcome change anne heche may have been atrocious but unlike janet leigh who was advertised as one of the biggest stars of the film anne heche was given last billing in the opening credits br br i read on the cover of a copy of the psycho novel that gus van sant claimed this was not a remake of the hitchcock film but rather a new adaptation of the original novel i now wish that i had bought that book and saved the comment because after seeing this film that comment is quite possibly the funniest thing i have ever seen there was no attempt in this film to disguise the fact that it was a rip off of the original and it would be far more believable if van sant had tried to tell us that he was really a three ton ape from the planet so many shots were copied exactly without any actual thought as to why hitchcock had composed the original shot in that way such as the scene in which sam and lila are talking while their faces are entirely covered in shadow hitchcock covered these actors' faces in shadow because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so nobody could see their awful performances not because of any artistic or stylistic purpose br br in other words my review is about as pointless as the movie itself in that it replicates something that's already been said like everyone else here i reccommend you don't waste your time on this film and get the original
<START> my god how bad this is who is this impostor pretending to be ali g avoid this at all costs it replaces the smart multi layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humour br br this was obviously an attempt to get him known in the states before he released his show there on hbo br br one commentator here pleads that we not judge the movie on the merits of the show due to the difference in the mediums while it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen mr sacha baron cohen could have ensured the smart use of his comic style in a more conventional movie storyline instead we have this mess which in all honesty has nothing at all to do with ali g except for the packaging br br terribly disappointing go seek out the dvd's of innit or bling bling for some real ali g
<START> this movie is really bad there is nothing appealing or worth of commentary in it except for the beautiful settings chilean landscape i know i must supply four lines as a commentary for this movie but the thing is that it is such a bad movie that i can only say that is actually bad michael ironside is the only one who saves the money in the film

<START> when naÃ¯ve young eddie hatch a window dresser at department store falls for a statue of venus and gives her a chaste kiss venus steps off her pedestal and gives eddie more than he bargained for this creaking example of what hollywood can do to a broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first rate songs the purpose was to make a safe popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on ava gardner's upward mobility to super stardom robert walker as eddie gets lost in a thankless role eddie's not just naive but dithering and hapless gardner is gorgeous but the only things that give the movie any life are olga san juan as eddie's loving but jealous girl friend tom conway as the suave owner of and eve arden as long time wise cracking secretary it's a role arden could play in her sleep and she's good at it br br the musical opened on broadway in 1943 and made mary martin a big time star the only point of a musical however is to have music since one touch of venus was intended to be a social satire of sorts kurt weill composing and ogden nash writing the lyrics came up with a series of stylish witty songs and one masterpiece without the satire or the clever songs or martin or an equivalent showstopper the movie becomes just a weak comedy fantasy where much of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is worked to death br br not only did the producers of the movie toss out almost all the weill nash songs they brought in the movie's music director ann to write new lyrics for one of the songs that survived turning sharp observation into lovey dovey romance was no hack she wrote willow weep for me wonder what she thought about while she replaced or tweaked ogden nash's clever work br br the one bright spot in the movie is that weill nash masterpiece speak low is as great a love song as anyone ever wrote it's given one of those ultra professional and lifeless treatments by eileen wilson dubbing gardner dick contributes a chorus br br as for ann she was one of the few women in hollywood to become a major music director as well as composer and lyric writer yours for a song the women of tin pan alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who made it in the business including kay swift dorothy fields and dana suess and for those who would like to hear what little of the weill nash score was recorded by the original broadway cast you might be able to track down the cd one touch of venus 1943 original cast lute song 1946 original cast the music is paired with lute song another broadway show that starred martin
<START> this is as good as it gets br br this is six episodes tracing briefly what life may have been like when dinosaurs ruled the earth done in the style of a nature documentary this show does away with talking heads instead just gives us the good stuff with the dinosaurs attempting to survive br br certainly this isn't a true documentary since none of what we see on screen can be attested to with any certainty but its a best guess and an entertaining one at that here is a show that brings dinosaurs to life in a realistic way that doesn't involve them eating people this is a show that should be shown to any kid who loves dinosaurs since it will instill them with the oh wow factor to go out and find out more it will also entertain the hell out of them and you br br see this if you love animal shows or nature or science or disney true life adventures except no one really gets killed or just a really good trip to somewhere else run out and get yourself a copy your brain will thank you
<START> this frothy romantic comedy is based on the kind of story i loved as a teenager but now find rather distasteful in the case of may september attachments doubtless what is on the mind of the elder party is either lust or an inability to face the reality of aging or both and the younger is most likely looking for the kind parent that she or he lacked as a child these underlying agendas seem more pathetic than romantic to me now there is also something rather predatory about them br br dick powell looked a bit embarrassed as well he should at playing the elder lover in this silly story he was at fifty attempting the role of a thirty eight year old man romancing a teen ager but young debbie reynolds was a knockout pretty and saucy and full of vinegar as a misbehaving seventeen year old presented as a kind of gift to the morally upright and honest screenwriter as a subject for him to study her spirited performance wrung from me a better rating than this film would otherwise deserve anne francis was cast as powell's beautiful but brittle fiancÃ©e and handled her small role deftly br br some of the dialogue was quite amusing too so it's not a total washout br br 5 10
<START> i have never forgot this movie all these years and it has remained in my life i have looked for this movie on so many sites and stores if anyone ever reads this and has a copy i will pay you for a copy of it or please let me know where i could find one this is a movie that should be a classic romance known as well as my other favorite somewhere in time it was truly brilliant if the right actors would remake this film and give it the patience it needs to be the right acting it could be a block buster a love story as powerful as this should be around for all lovers to see i remember how sad i was at the ending and it really came as a shock i believe with all my heart that johnny really loved the woman and she him this was one terrific movie and it is a shame that it is not available for us to purchase please contact me at aol com i want to give my thanks to a wonderful lady that responded to my message almost a year later she had a copy of the movie and was so kind to send it to me she is a great fan of this movie as i am with her help there have been 3 happy ladies to receive these she is waiting for the book that it is based on i am checking with my local library for it titled affair by lynn i am sure it is great also many thanks to julie for her graciousness and friendship i am your friend always sharon
<START> i think that it was just like lizzie mcguire except that it was a lot worse than the original the only thing that is different is that she likes animals and science and all of that geeky stuff everything else is the same she likes a guy that she is too nervous to ask out and later she finds a guy that does like her and she has no clue i think that people need to quit making that same kind of shows and another thing that is the same is that it is always thaw the friends are two girls and one guy don't people think that these things get old and tired and these ideas keep being used over and over and yet they keep using these ideas but i do know people who watch this show and i know that they like them
<START> proudly and defiantly working class porter perks mr b cribbins is eventually won over by upper middle class family down on their luck father mr i incarcerated for treason for which the penalty was death in those days lest it be forgotten mother the very beautiful miss d sheridan brave and resourceful loyal and loving and principally older daughter miss j agutter tottering on the cusp of adolescence hurt and confused about the fate of her father mr perks like many working people of his time will have nothing to do with anything that he considers smacks of charity and it is a key moment in the movie when he finally accepts that birthday gifts he has been given by the children do not compromise his principles although the lovely miss agutter has received all the accolades it is mr cribbins and miss sheridan whose performances dominate the railway children they both know how edwardian society works from opposite ends of the spectrum but there is an unspoken mutual respect and understanding between them but this is basically a movie about family in an era when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and hold her to ransom and be considered as socially inept rather than unfit to live in decent society and when two human beings can beat and kick a baby to death without being charged with murder family may be seen as an old fashioned elitist racist even homophobic concept but a century ago it was the glue that held society together at all levels mr and miss sheridan's families are archetypal for the age strong and loving sticking together against outside influences integral units with a moral certainty mocked in the 21st century what might seem to be a dull preachy political tract is turned by mr lionel jeffries into a delightful hymn to hope faith optimism and courage that all those attributes were once considered the norm and are now too often the subject of scorn and cynicism is a reflection on our society rather than miss no one with more than a passing concern for the human condition can fail to be considerably moved by this quite perfect movie
<START> this is such an exciting documentary it was by far one of the most fun films i've ever seen i highly recommend it to anyone it's such a fun look at different musical styles exciting people at the crossroads between modern and traditional that is istanbul and great cinematography that captures beautiful scenes in istanbul and thrace watching the film made me want to book a flight for istanbul right away br br great footage of a turkish rapper br br also his sister rapping she is awesome br br priceless performances by amazing turkish musicians br br the gorgeous voice of singing in kurdish br br and amazing clarinet and signing of a romany gypsy group from thrace br br last but not least istanbul bands mixing turkish music and rock as well as trance music baba orient expressions and others
<START> synopsis kid is not accepted into any colleges he creates a college where he and his friends can party by using their parent's tuition money br br wow a paean to ignorance br br if you believe that we're all ok man then this movie is for you furthermore you must understand that br br 1 kids have it all inside them they just need to let it out br br 2 teaching really the innate creativity that everyone is born with br br 3 someone else should pay for you to follow your passion br br 4 300 teenagers can live together in harmony as long as you take away those restrictive rules br br 5 extemporaneous speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation br br 6 if the board of education allows you to open a charter school with teaching techniques it's because they have your best interests at heart not that they are willing to let go of low functioning students who will end up working fast food anyways br br this movie is one in the college comedy genre i e animal house it follows the pattern pretty closely what's new here though is a complete attack on higher education not a parody of the bad elements it's missing the sympathetic insider a professor who embodies the worthwhile part of university life br br this lack of balance will doom this film to the back rows of blockbuster it is so one sided that i wondered if it was an ironic self referential take on the whole genre for about one minute the movie has no deep meaning no layers no introspection it's as if they let some kids who never went to class do what comes naturally and what is natural is what the name of the school is s br br never thought i'd say this go see something with will farrell instead his comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated
<START> my ex wife and i saw and were intrigued by the trailer for this film we waited for it to come out but when it did it didn't stay in theaters very long several years later i bought it on vhs and i am transferring it to dvd so i can preserve it br br i found it to be very moving it is about real events in a real country burma got such a bad reputation for the political oppression it created that they changed their name br br i find women with little make up on to be very sexy patricia arquette is in this movie frances and spalding gray are in it only briefly br br after coming home to find her young son and husband brutally murdered laura arquette is afraid of blood a bad trait for a doctor her sister talks her into going on a vacation to burma while there she witnesses a peaceful demonstration and has her passport stolen in a bold or stupid move she asks a tourist guide to show her something off the tourist track her guide is injured by soldiers and she spends the rest of the movie trying to get him and herself to safety br br every time i watch this it reminds me that we in the united states forget that to a peasant living under military rule socialism where at least eating is virtually guaranteed looks pretty darn good
<START> i have watched thousands of movies in my life and i believe this movie is the most perfect movie that has ever been made by perfect i mean the storytelling the plot the acting the staging the camera work etc this is a lay opinion i have no background in film production a lot of movies have perfect scenes such as the bartender filing a report with the police officer in the movie fargo indeed that scene could play well as a short in the dead every scene is done to perfection making the entire movie perfect perhaps john huston sold his soul to the devil to make such a movie hopefully daniel webster has gotten him out of the contract
<START> easily one of my favourite dramatic tv films in many ways beautiful yet sad heart warming and thought provoking this is a superb dramatisation of a few years in the life of c s lewis and his relationship with joy i found it to be incredibly absorbing with excellent and 'realistic' dialogue and situations it all seemed very 'real' yet there were also moments that almost leave you breathless with delight ackland and bloom as the central characters were excellent as were the supporting cast it's one of those dramas that i find hard to criticise simply because for me there is nothing to be criticised it just works so well on so many levels br br very highly recommended
