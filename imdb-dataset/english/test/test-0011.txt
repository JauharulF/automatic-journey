<START> a mild mannered ny lawyer george segal is slowly going crazy he promised his father on his death bed that he would never send their senile mother ruth gordon to a nursing home years later he's taking care of a senile dangerous psychopath he meets a beautiful nurse trish van and they fall in love but his mother keeps scaring her away segal is ready to kill her br br ummmm this is a comedy i have nothing against sick black humor but come on there has to be some limits this movie goes out of its way to throw every tasteless sick joke it can think of and rub your face in it too bad none of the jokes are funny the jokes involve rape nudity public humiliation senile old people swearing and racism basically this is a movie that thinks it's clever by trying to shock people and thinking they'll laugh at it i was disgusted and didn't laugh once the movie is morbid disturbing and surprisingly dull the cast is the only thing that kept me watching segal and gordon were both wonderful in their roles gordon especially and van is pretty good also but the script is against them the only interesting thing not funny was a pointless courtroom scene with rob reiner jr and try to spot his then wife penny marshall as a spectator br br actually this movie could have been worse the original ending had segal getting into bed with his mother and pretending he's poppa that was thankfully changed br br a real lousy sick film bottom of the barrel i give it a 1
<START> julie andrews satirically prods her own goody two shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy drama but if she approaches her role with aplomb she's alone in doing so blake edwards' film about a woman who is both music hall entertainer and german spy during wwi doesn't know what tone to aim for and rock hudson has the thankless task of playing romantic second fiddle musicals had grown out of favor by 1970 and productions like star and this film really tarnished andrews' reputation leaving a lot of dead space in her catalogue until the seed came along i've always thought julie andrews would've made a great villain or shady lady her strong voice could really command attention and she hits some low notes that can either be imposing or seductive husband director edwards seems to realize this but neither he nor julie can work up much energy within this scenario screenwriter william peter blatty isn't a good partner for edwards and neither man has his heart in this material beatty's script offers andrews just one fabulous sequence a striptease 1 2 from
<START> for all viewers out there who have slammed john waters for creating a film like pink flamingos just stop it's getting you nowhere has anyone ever cared to stop and think about the ambition and dedication mr waters possesses to gather your best friends up and to create a movie just to gross out thousands of viewers all over shows this man has a great deal of ambition inside himself just read his biography shock value it discusses the lengths he went through to get this film finished maybe it wasn't just the fact that john made this film to gross people out it was to prove that there can be something such as good bad taste
<START> i have to say is the only reason i even watched this film he is good however everything else about this film is so far below average that it's not worth the time and effort spent viewing this film br br this film has loads of technical aesthetic issues namely shot selections framing camera movements within monologue sequences extremely bad editing probably due to the total lack of fluidity in and between shots and overall terrible acting except for br br it was far too theatrical in acting and presentation to develop any sort of suspenseful moment in this film which is surprising because it's all about a bank robbery which should be at least somewhat exciting br br how does a film this bad get made and then released and then distributed br br kind of reminds me of a c film student's thesis project probably not even that good though
<START> i thought that this movie might be a good spoof or at least a good independent comedy like friday instead it was more like something someone in high school would make with their parents' camcorder it wasn't just the low budget that makes this film bad many great films have been made on a low budget it is simply a bad movie and it wasn't even bad enough to be good camp case in point for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking dope put on their makeup and then answer a phone call you keep waiting for something to get story moving but it never comes the sound was so bad i had to turn the tv up all the way just to almost make out what they were saying which wasn't interesting anyways if i pay to rent a movie i will usually suffer through it even when it's bad but it was all i could do to sit through 20 minutes it looks like the person before me felt the same way because they didn't rewind the tape and left off about the same place i did the only reason i gave this a score of 1 is because the rating system doesn't have negative numbers
<START> ever have one of those sneezes that seems to build up forever you gasp and you and you grab the nearest paper product in preparation for the world's greatest hanky blower and then it fizzles frankenhooker was the cinematic equivalent of that lost sneeze now i'm big on b movies and i always look the other way when a boom mike pops onscreen or an actor speaks his or her lines with all the enthusiasm of gerald ford but this one really let me down the cover of the video for instance is the tag line of the whole movie using parts from murdered new york prostitutes dr franken rebuilds his deceased fiancee only to have her run amok in manhattan as a sort of with a bad attitude after an hour and a half of build up this fairly funny ten minutes seemed a little anti climactic
<START> i can't say that this movie deserves a ten because i would be lying i adored this movie when i saw it though it carries the unique bond of a friendship between a teenager and a dolphin although it doesn't display the sweetness that jesse and willy had in free willy it provides an exciting movie that the whole family will enjoy if you love marine animals or if u love just a perfect family film this movie is suited for you flipper definitely shows us how adorable dolphins are and they are playful and could easily be house pets if everyone had a big enough pool i love whales and dolphins so obviously this movie works for me i do think that the producers should have chosen another shark instead of the hammerhead to enhance the antagonist part in the story perhaps a great white flipper is magnificent so check it out
<START> tommy lee jones was the best and no one can play f call better than he not only was he the first and best he was the only person that could portray his grief and confusion it was a bad let down and i'm surprised i even made myself watch it i can even begin how how pitiful they made i understand he would be old by that time but everyone knows that he would never let that pull him down the first movie was the best and the only one that i'll ever watch i hope to god that no more directors plan on continuing or remaking the wonderful classic without tommy or duval without them the movies are pointless wastes of time and money for everyone including the director if you plan on making another lonesome dove movie of any kind take mine and billions of others don't waste time continuing the movies is just grinding the first one into the ground thanks
<START> it's the best movie i have ever seen i just love them i watch it every day i have the episodes from the internet here in romania is being broadcast the 6 season i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season until now season 5 is my favorite one d i love it because logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite i have liked dean too but logan is best i would like to remain with christopher because he is beautiful this show is good for all ages and is worth to be seen i really want the dvd's but i think that here in romania will never appear because i think that they don't even know that they have fans here but no matter what i'll be watching it bye
<START> i'm not a fan of scratching but i really dug this movie it gave me a real insight into a world i never had a clue existed and what else is a documentary for funny clever hip just like previous film hype about the grunge music scene
<START> dear friends i've never seen such a trash movie as night of the demons 1988 it seems that the director kevin tenney had the intention to copy classics like the evil dead by sam raimi 1978 or george a romero's return of the living dead from the same year the cinematography was lousy the movie was very dark so i had to turn the brightness control to the maximum indeed horror pictures have to be dark but not the way like night of the demons the entire movie was ridiculous no suspense worse actors except alvin alexis in the role of rodger and horrible make up effects an average vote of 5 stars for that movie i can't believe this perhaps the users were pleased about the tits asses and pussies of the actresses they were indeed worth 5 stars regards hans dieter
<START> this film was adapted from the well known sutra on journey to the west where a monk with his three students seek out to find a long lost book with regards to the teaching of buddha br br though this movie is not as solemn as the previous films made according to the legend it did however managed to bring in romance and fun filled humorous scene br br this real objective of this movie revolves around more on the monk who were primarily saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures one of his student the monkey god managed to get him out from the battle in the nick of time but were in turn captured by the demons and cast into the deep throat of a dragon locked up in that particular dungeon br br the monk awoke in a small village where he found mei yan the so called ugly serpent daughter who fell in love over him at first sight though ugly she did not let her appearance be casted aside from getting to him however a quest for rescuing his three students soon turn out to be filled with obstacles and each of which turned out to get worse with mei yan following the monk problems crept deeper and this is where conflicts between the relationship gets worse br br the rest of the tale would be left at your own disposal but suffice to say this film does not depict the typical storyline of the book it is more for those who wants to seek out for a funny and light picture of what journey to the west and the love obstacles really mean br br towards the very end the whole summary could be described with only one word and that is love the monk went to show the heavenly gates the celestial palace and buddha himself how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and deemed fit as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior powers br br a wonderfully created and funny acts awaits those who buys this ticket there would be of course no regrets at least from my side and those who were with me at the cinema that day watching the same film
<START> mgm tried pairing up and coming young men with the divine one to give them exposure and try them out as leading men gable and garbo had chemistry in susan but it was a lousy film here in inspiration there is no chemistry whatsoever between garbo and robert montgomery and the script is poor as well what were they thinking the modern fast talking wise crack snapping montgomery and the long suffering garbo it is a tale like camille young student falls for woman of the world and is repelled by learning of her past rejects her takes her back rejects her you get the picture garbo is completely believable as a top parisian artist's model and completely at home although bored with her life at the top of society amidst her artistic friends and their loose morals suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent she finally gives up her life for him and sinks into poverty only to be rescued by him and set up in a house of her own ironically he intends to marry and keep her on the side so much for his pure moral ethic of earlier br br the scenes are incredibly dull and boring and nothing much happens only marjorie rambeau as lulu is able to inject life into the proceedings with such lines as unfortunately weak women have strong appetites and odette where is thy sting br br only for garbo fans
<START> it's not easy to find judas kiss on vhs it's not available on dvd but i wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my alan rickman movie collection br br i can't understand how the talented mr rickman gets into these mediocre films judas kiss boasts several wonderful actors an interesting plot and intriguing twists but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character's actions why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses why did he mistrust the detective he replaced there were times when i honestly couldn't tell if the director meant judas kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof why else would he toss in a topless alien lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby did he purposely instruct his two distinguished english actors alan rickman and emma thompson to use such awful new accents as an alan freak i confess that i still thought mr rickman was sexy in a rumpled weary take him home and tuck him in sort of way br br judas kiss isn't a great movie but it does have some intriguing moments but i don't recommend it unless you're trying to immerse yourself in alan rickman
<START> i love japanese movies having seen at least 100 200 so it's obvious i am not afraid of japanese films however sometimes there are japanese concepts for film that just don't translate well to westerners they might be hits at home but abroad they just don't seem well normal it's like the live fish my wife ate on a business meeting or odd ps2 games such as dating or things that are accepted there that confuse non japanese this is probably the way others view things americans take for granted such as american football fried snicker bars and paris hilton well the king of strange japanese films that just don't seem right to americans might just be yama now the style of animation isn't the issue it's different but nice enough no it's the story concept itself and the rather bizarre ending that's what make this a truly unusual film and it goes like this there was a stingy man who for no apparent reason had a tree growing out of his head it was little at first and he simply cut it away but again and again it grew back so he just decided to let it go and after a while people began living on his head under the shade of the tree oddly while they were under the tree they were tiny but when they left they were full sized again then after finally getting sick of it all and yanking out the tree the man drown himself in the hole in the top of the head where the tree was the end br br see i told you this was very very odd but not in a good way like tampopo or happiness of the katakuris just odd o d d odd and unless you have a very high tolerance for this sort of thing i doubt if you'll feel bad to know that this oscar nominated film did not win frankly that makes me happy as i really don't want this film to spur on such similar films the only reason it earns a 4 is due to nice but not spectacular animation br br this film made my brain hurt i hope that isn't a sign that i have a tree
