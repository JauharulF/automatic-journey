<START> you know i really hate imdb's censor system since my entire review is almost gone if you take out the cursing but here we go editing time br br holy is this bad i thought it might be a cool little movie judging by the plot summary since i've blindly rented such gems as frailty and american nightmare before but this is just it's about a killer who uses edgar allen poe's works as reference for his murderous exploits and the story of a detective who has to stop him can't these blithering hacks make a good movie without defiling the grave of a great horror writer i mean the kills in here are completely devoid of thought or originality and the references to poe are hokey and fake without enough thought put into them they're shallow and they put poe's work to shame full of holes with awful sequencing the acting is bad too reminding me of the abortion that was known in some third world countries as fear x what with all the pausing and un emotional lines br br i realize this is an indie movie but that's no excuse i've seen high school kids act better then these morons and i myself could've come up with better kill scenes and a better plot given ample time br br this has no reason to exist avoid at all costs
<START> see no evil with kane the movie has a great storyline but it just wasn't a hide my eye's scream out loud horror flick i thought it was going to be from watching the wwe superstars on monday night raw when the movie first came to theaters i did enjoy the movie though i loved the story it played out br br great movie excellent would like to see a part 2 br br it doesn't matter if kane gets killed at the end br br or not they have killed off other horror stars in every movie br br they have out and they still comeback for more so a part 2 would br br be very interesting
<START> i'm sorry guys all who thought this film could be something great i'm afraid you would be disappointed br br the standard the movie wanted to set is completely ruined by some very simple plot so simple that the movie is not evolving until the end i asked myself if the plot wasn't about the action but about the main character played by mickey rourke but i found that the character was inconsistent either he is a professional killer or some guilt haunted brother but both don't go together because the kid he tries to guide poses him in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself now joseph gordon levitt is a good looking actor but he played his character a little unnatural i didn't believe his acting it looked like the director tried to pull out of him some personality he couldn't provide and he didn't have to because his less crazy behavior was creepy enough the only one whose acting was great was diane lane if not her i would give this movie 1 star br br in conclusion i expected to see some well played movie and some interesting plot and i completely blew it with my high expectations
<START> i wish i could have met ida lupino when people ask who you if you could have 6 extraordinary 20th century persons over for dinner well for me one person would be her i think she is now one of the great unsung and personalities in the film industry her life story would make a great tele movie hey mr bogdanovich ida lupino has been the driving force in many fascinating noir films of the 40s and 50s i can remember being saddened at seeing her reduced to a horrible part in a ghastly aip film is the late 70s she was bitten by a big worm at the kitchen sink ugh i should have contacted her then as she died not long after more from the part than the worm too from high sierra roadhouse and the extraordinary rko thriller on dangerous ground ida lupino was often the producer and the lead actress later with her husband howard duff they produced many now timeless noir dramas that are still very engrossing today one of them is jennifer which i think is the last film with a monogram pictures copyright monogram changed the company name formally to allied artists in 1953 and jennifer has both company names on the opening credits this is a superior haunted house thriller equally as scary as both the innocents and the haunting made 8 years later really chilling and very creepy this tiny film is exactly the sort of really good film ida lupino made and was responsible for try and find it you will always remember it and as i feel much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress producer
<START> the last good ernest movie and the best at that how can you not laugh at least once at this movie the last line is a classic as is ernest's gangster impressions his best moment on film this has his best lines and is a crowning achievement among the brainless screwball comedies
<START> i just finished watching this film and think it is one of the worst films i have ever seen it was so boring that i found myself zooming through it at x2 speed and finished it in less than 30 minutes i was not just disappointed but angry that i had wasted my money to rent it it ranks within the top five of the worst films i have ever seen and i've seen thousands of movies the plot was very confusing had i not first read the dvd sleeve cover prior to renting it i would have been totally lost throughout this film i would not have thought that tim robbins after having made such good films as shawshank redemption would have agreed to appear in this film
<START> i was a child when i saw this serial a bit after seen buck rogers one both characters performed by the same buster crabbe and i must acknowledge that these films have always been part of the best entertainment i've ever had the fight against emperor ming was one thing but i was more interested to know about the final fate of the love triangle of flash with dale and aura came and persuaded aura to forget flash very innocent termination of her obsession for good looking flash the serial has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be watched by all audiences another thing is that i learned floating in water looking the way crabbe did it when fighting against shark men the soundtrack was also nice although it was used previously in another film of boris karloff's frankenstein it would be nice to have the dvd of this serial provided that it comes with subtitles in spanish not yet available
<START> barbershop 2 back in business wasn't as good as it's original but was just as funny the movie itself lacked little things which the original held which made it much more enjoyable back in business seemed to be just another worthless sequel made to bring in money with a very thin plot cedric the terrible excuses for flashbacks ruined the movie and seemed to be a bad way to try and get the audience to adapt more with the character overall barbershop 2 back in business was a sequel not needed without the originals charm soul spark
<START> there is a phrase by the experimental filmmaker nathaniel who says some films are structured like a camera mounted on the head of a dog who goes down an alley sniffing everything along the way br br that's how this movie is the structure is kurosawa started out as a baby then he became a kid then a young man then a movie director then he started making then he grew old the end the word 'masterpiece' is used a lot in this film to describe kurosawa's output without explaining what makes his films so good great just because the off screen narrator reading a script says that a film is a masterpiece are we supposed to kiss his rear end and accept that a certain movie is one of the great works of art of the 20th century and one more point the voice of paul scofield is used as the voice of kurosawa when excerpts from the director's memoirs are being read off screen he brings pear shaped shakespearean tones to the text but why him if you were making a documentary about billie holiday would you use dame judi as her voice
<START> many questions arise about the making of this film the first of which is why make a film that plays out as little more than an awkward female fantasy it's one thing to leave an audience with issues to discuss about a film's intent it's something entirely different to go into the process of writing a script which fails to adequately address real human issues before they are rendered on the screen br br why the outrageously melodramatic and often comical soundtrack why the excessive and frequently clunky dialogue why is the lead character's girlfriend one of the hooded abductors what purpose is there to turning the lead character's freedom from abduction into a joke by having him complete his mission this is a classic little aussie film moment resort to quirky comedy at the most inappropriate moment why so many scenes where absolutely nothing happens this accounts for approximately 15 minutes of the film which is at least 30 minutes too long why if a man is imprisoned for so many days does he not endeavor to make a serious attempt at escape br br the director who co wrote the script has failed on many counts to deliver a satisfactory story br br dave garver australia
<START> i just saw this on a local independent station in the new york city area the cast showed promise but when i saw the director george i became suspicious and sure enough it was every bit as bad every bit as pointless and stupid as every george movie i ever saw he's like a stupid man's michael bey with all the awfulness that accolade promises br br there's no point to the conspiracy no burning issues that urge the conspirators on we are left to ourselves to connect the dots from one bit of graffiti on various walls in the film to the next thus the current budget crisis the war in iraq islamic extremism the fate of social security 47 million americans without health care wages and the death of the middle class are all subsumed by the sheer terror of graffiti br br a truly stunningly idiotic film
<START> this is the worst movie of all time it's one of those that is so ridiculous and the acting so bad that you turn off the video 1 3 into it so that you can use your time for better purposes like cleaning the toilet if you actually watch the whole thing god help you
<START> eight legged freaks is a modern monster movie like a remake of any of the old 'attack of the giant insert animal here ' movies of the 50s 60s and 70s or rather it should have been more like a remake of the instead of what is was so how is a monster movie done in the year 2002 well from the typical opening with some chemical making the spiders grow to huge proportions they mix movies like gremlins jurassic park starship troopers and flavor it with some parody like scary movie gremlins is probably the best comparison but eight legged freaks was so full of parodies and stupid jokes that it was sometimes more like scary movie it was way too much at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another parody movie filled with jokes br br for a movie like this you don't expect much of the acting and that is just the way it was the story though was extremely thin with just a bunch of loosely connected events to show off some action mixed with all of the jokes leading up to an easily spotted and corny ending br br i rate eight legged freaks a 4 10 and that includes the fact that the special effects where pretty good and that the noises the spiders made where hilarious
<START> this harold lloyd short wasn't really much not one of his funnier efforts of course i never see bratty kids as anything hilarious that's what the bulk of this story is harold and his wife mildred davis babysitting his in laws two young kids one is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four year old terror who does everything but demolish the house letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to me br br the best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon noah young is burglarizing their house half the time it's the pet cat scaring the couple but overall that segment is fun with some good sight gags reminding me of another lloyd short haunted spooks br br however the good ending doesn't save the whole picture which i probably wouldn't watch again lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again it just isn't that funny
<START> i'm afraid i must disagree with mr radcliffe as although he is correct in saying this isn't a comedy it has many other merits the plot is a little mad at parts but i believe it it all fits together nicely creating a satisfying enjoyable film the last scene was rather abysmal compared to the rest of the film but the actual ending of the plot a few scenes previously is very interesting showing just what someone will do under stressful circumstances br br i would recommend this film to fans of thrillers and action movies but if you're a fan of gangster movies then as long as you don't expect expect something as deep as goodfellas then you should still find it enjoyable
