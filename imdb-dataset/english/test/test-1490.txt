<START> i rented this movie because i love and i've watched her on many tv shows and since she's having her 15 minutes of fame nowadays with her new movie i wanted to check out what other movies she has been in br br she's just ok in terms of acting not good and not bad either she makes up for everything by being extremely gorgeous br br rodney rowland was quite a surprise as the hero he provided the only solid good acting in the movie he's a very good actor and should probably be an action star br br besides being ok and rodney being really good everything else about this movie is garbage in its purest form br br a computer hacker hacks into the system of a plane from the ground and using a joystick he tries to slam the plane into a nuclear power plant or something and of course there are the heroes who stand in his way and ruin his game br br this is one of the worst scripts i have ever seen and no wonder it was a low budget flick br br what's shocking is that this movie was made in 2001 and it has way too many similarities to the september 11th tragedies br br why do they make movies like this in the first place br br panic one star a waste of too good actors also a waste of time also known as air panic
<START> i recently rented this film on dvd and thought it would be an interesting choice seeing as i am both from the north of england bradford and also interested in film making however it soon became apparent that this film seemed to lack a decent level of development script wise the characters were weak and often stereotyped and the story lacked substance the subject matter could be an interesting basis for a film however the delivery of this appeared naive and unfocused br br the ending felt as though it was casting judgement on the characters punishing and rewarding where the filmmakers felt necessary this felt a little awkward and silly and seemed at odds with the 'realism' used in the style of shooting for me the film dealt with the characters and subject matter in a rather heavy handed and clumsy manner it felt as though the writer had already decided how he wanted to end the story and set about crow barring everything else in to fit it br br another point that i feel strongly about is the watered down ken loach feel the film had i get quite upset that uk film financiers can't see that there is more to british films than it has become almost a safe option film is an infinitely wonderful playground for imaginative ideas and it is not being exploited by uk feature film producers there is a lot of talent here in the uk it's unfortunate that most of these individuals end up either making music videos and commercials 100 of the time or they go to america br br love hate would have worked better if it had been cut down to 30 or 60 minutes and appeared as a one off tv drama
<START> the worst movie i've seen in a long time this whole thing rings false and the billy crudup character especially so the potential for a good story is there but this movie never comes close to delivering every plot element just drifts away
<START> this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if you're looking for the be all end all of movies look no further the story of a man bent on revenge and how better to get it i know i'll suck out their brains with great sound effects and impressive special effects i can't recommend this movie enough
<START> br br this movie sucked the first one was way better no one from the first has returned in this dumb sequel and in some way that is a good thing because of the bad acting but the characters in this film are not even better killjoy in the woods come on give me a break i'm suprised friend the blair witch didn't show up to make a cameo bad acting bad story and just plain out silly and boring don't waste your time
<START> when i first heard that jack black and kyle gass would make a movie about their band i was freaking out i love their music and i hoped that this movie would be really funny now that i have watched it i can't really say that these hopes weren't satisfied but i think i expected more the movie is full of tenacious d's great music and i really loved listening to all of it there are a lot of great jokes and i just love the story at least the first bit i don't like the way the movie ends the ending is very abrupt and in my opinion they could have extended that a bit more br br overall i think it is a good movie to watch everyone who likes rock music should watch it it'll give you a good laugh
<START> this film was shot in randolph county in central north carolina in 1968 when a film crew in the state was a rare thing the locations were the of liberty and and the surrounding rural countryside it is not a particularly good movie it did have merle haggard and it brought life to the hinterlands for a few minutes br br the plot is standard the cinematography is that fuzzy stuff that came out of the late sixties and early seventies the local folks were thrilled to be a part of the enterprise br br if viewers have difficulty finding a copy of this film a record copy is available in nc br br actors not credited include ben jones mimi pravda tommy hull bill nunnery
<START> for one used to the comedies on television now whether sketch sitcom or animated it's nice to watch something truly refreshing br br the chaser has to be the best comedy of this decade seinfeld being the triumph it follows the hosts urban crusades to fix situations do road and try to get the facts from our politicians the good old fashioned way br br despite being very controversial at times the shows excellent quality from the well made and truly funny opening credits to the sketch style investigations sketch style only in time they are not scripted at least not the ones at the other end of the joke is certainly worth watching even the most cynical and intellectual viewer won't be disappointed and the show deserves ten stars br br all in all well done to the abc for showing this and i recommend it highly
<START> proof if ever proof were needed that hammer should have left their vampires firmly in the victorian age after all vampirism is all about repressed sexuality so the concept is irrelevant in 1972's london with its thirty something pretending to be randy teenagers br br remember by this time hammer was floundering badly the public had tired of the drawing room horror of the 1950s and 60s so the studio was trying everything to bring them back including ample nudity lust for a vampire et al and updating their characters neither of which apparently worked as hammer was pretty much resting in it grave just two years later shame br br but i still have a great fondness for the classic hammer period from 1957 1965
<START> in my personal opinion Â«the is one of the best steven seagal movies br br i've heard people say it's the worst one ever it's not like ss etc i disagree as a highly spiritual person a great master seagal established a good tradition in action movies he always has a good background great action high professionalism and a clever message this movie has it all you have good shooting scenes great aikido although there isn't a lot of it it shows us its peaceful side this change in his film making only proves his spiritual growth he doesn't kill buddy in the end br br Â«the is definitely one of the best films from the point of view which i have seen lately you have great panoramic shots of montana we see real american nature and beautiful wildlife among others horses and flowers the soundtrack also deserves a few words during the film i had a great opportunity to listen to classical american cowboy western music not country though similar music was heard in to the future acting has greatly improved since his last films his role is unfamiliar to him unlike cops commandos but he does a good job playing the retired doctor from the government his acting is convincing and his lines are good br br i was really pleased with the cast jones proves that life death walk the earth together whitney yellow robe plays a beautiful and clever scientist camilla belle makes a great appearance as daughter br br mr seagal discusses the much debated tradition and the militia squads providing his own point of view he likes the constitution just fine but chubby bearded men have nothing to do with it also good points are raised regarding the eastern western medicine system and nature br br seagal's best and opening new horizons in his film career br br
<START> if you haven't seen this movie than you need to it rocks and you have to watch it it is so funny and will make you laugh your guts out so you have to watch it and i saw it about a billion and a half times and still think it is funny so you have to yes i have memorized the whole movie and could quote it to you from start to finish you must see this move it is also cute because it is half a chick flick if you don't watch it then you are really missing out this movie even has cute guys in it and that is always a bonus so in summary watch the movie now and trust me you will not be making a mistake did i mention the music is good too so you should like it if you enjoy music this is a movie that they rated correctly and it will work for anyone
<START> for those expecting the cover art and story outline to indicate another entertaining bollywood indian production beware no musical dance numbers or songs of production value exist to brighten the mood in this rather tired story of arranged marriages in the british indian culture with a few variations thrown in as written by parekh the script jumps around topics worthy of discussion only to cover them up with routine avoidance tactics singh directs like a traffic cop trying to hold together the disparate subplots to the point of keystone cop tactics br br jimi chris is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover jack peter ash and they live with jack's obese alcoholic loose morals aunt vanessa sally and sally's chubby daughter hannah katy clayton family is visited by the patel family from delhi who bring their beautiful daughter mahal to england to find a husband parents jaffrey and massey and his grandmother zohra decide is the girl for jimi to marry and arrange an engagement and wedding in the custom of indian ways without consulting jimi jimi discovers the plot and is too spineless not to go along with it a decision which enrages jack and infuriates vanessa hannah tells a 'little to that she is daughter and the wedding is off when parents visit house they discover the drunken vanessa are repulsed by her but eventually decide that for happiness they will go along with the fact that vanessa has given them a and decide to use the marriage preparations as a wedding for jimi and vanessa jimi convinces the very reluctant vanessa to go along with the idea and before long vanessa is dressed in a sari prepared for a wedding and jimi terrified at what he is doing just to please his parents includes jack as his best man at the wedding the truth comes out and to surprise his family adapts to true self and the day is saved by simply being truthful br br the cast copes with this silly bit of nonsense rather well and there are some good performances chris and peter ash are attractive men and play their roles well albeit without any indication at all of a loving relationship the director seems terrified of showing the least suggestion of intimacy between the two men sally provides most of the laughs as vanessa the rest of the cast repeat the stereotype roles they've played countless times in indian movies this is not a bad film it has its moments but it is just too superficial and tired to make us care about any of the characters
<START> this movie was recently shown subtitled not dubbed on australia's special broadcasting service i thought i read here that there is sometimes an assumption that revenge of the rats is a sequel in fact the rats are getting revenge for something that is done within this movie or in human history there is no prequel as far as i know br br now let's get the pied piper of out of the way perhaps this tale crossed my mind when i was watching the film but that's all there was the use of the word coffers at the end of the movie a dazed mayor tries to justify her actions by saying the coffers were empty coffers isn't a word you hear around much these days unless you read folk tales to your children as i do since seeing revenge of the rats i've read two versions of the pied piper of now i see the comparison a metaphorical fat but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford to get rid of the rats this is about as far as i can follow the analogy the children are not led to a door in a mountain with one lame boy left behind to tell of a land of winged horses and fountains where it is always spring and everyone is always happy br br there's a lot that is quite mainstream about this movie the romance and the resolution especially the female characters have potentially powerful roles in society but are really quite impotent where this film is quite rebellious as compared with american cinema is that it is anti authoritarian the helicopter pilot is sacked by the mayor for doing good the mayor and local government are portrayed as corrupt and pandering to big money finally it is left to one doctor in frankfurt to solve an epidemic of a fatal and contagious disease apparently there is no national infectious diseases authority to co things or send in back up br br i'm not a horror aficionado so any horror i do see is usually mingled with humour right from the rat in the blood bank you can see this is going to have the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers the huge number of rats is impressive and the horror fans seem to be satisfied too
<START> this almost documentary look at an enterprising boy who lives in the body shop area outside of new york is real all the way real lighting real sound less editing in the whole movie than in 1 minute of most movies and while there is very little script there is a story shot in primary colors almost all red white blue and yellow we get a real sense of the life of a boy who is making something from nothing he has a place to live that he makes his own has a good job and is trying to bring his sister into his little universe the people in the chop shop area also give us a look at this culture which i didn't know about they mostly seem decent and pay ale what seems like daily seeming truly concerned about his well being the actor i think playing ale says more with one facial expression than one can imagine this reminded me what a true small movie can accomplish it shows what kids are capable of even without much support and love definitely recommend
<START> yes this show had a lot of male frontal nudity and yes over the years the plot lines became over the top melodramatic and very unrealistic however it didn't matter because the show is great you really get involved in the characters and every character no matter how minor or major is perfectly cast br br i can't imagine anyone else except simmons play the neo nazi racist rapist leader nor anyone else playing tobias except lee the transformation of his character from season 1 to season 2 is amazing however the character that made oz oz was chris keller played by christopher meloni he didn't have relations with anyone else in prison except well except ronnie but that was only to get ronnie to stop playing around with keller's lover boy their relationship transcended sexes and tom fontana actually made us care about those two and want those two to be together br br i loved soft spot for his kids in the show and how fontana made sympathetic characters out of all these heinous criminals that we grew to adore even simon br br however some plot lines were totally unbelievable and unrealistic a guy building a bomb in oz guys standing in a spotlight in their windows in their pods looking at other men plotting something in their mind too over the top drugs getting in oz everyone in the rehab group used or sold drugs and sister pete never helped anyone in six years people getting killed in the gym supply closet and kitchen no one hurting ryan's mom no one fighting cyril outside the boxing ring except vern of course two inmates with tools being left alone in the elevator shaft and one of them dying with no investigation karl metzger guard gets killed and no one investigates governor holds all his press conferences at the prison all an inmate needs to do is say i want to see glenn or i want to see mcmanus and they are taken to them no questions asked people die every week in oz on the outside people kill someone and get 20 years up for parole in eight but if they kill someone on the inside they go to death row almost immediately there is no on site paid staff in the kitchen or mail room inmates run both departments no questions asked aging drugs for inmates to substitute as time served ryan has no friends or associates but he never gets hurt killed maimed raped or beaten the guys never flush the toilets when they go to the bathroom or throw up an nba scout comes to the prison to recruit for an nba player yeah right br br however with all these flaws this show is still awesome it's gruesome brutal sexy edgy raw and innovative dean winters scott william winters simmons christopher meloni luiz guzman adele the guy that played simon walker lee terry mums male alexander ll cool j etc etc etc all are awesome and made the show worth watching br br i highly recommend renting this on dvd season six comes out 9 06 next month first five seasons are on dvd watch them and then watch them again with audio commentary i loved the director's commentary with chazz palmentari the sequence with andy running down the cafeteria tables and then falling into the hole was an awesome top notch shot kudos and kathy bates directing family business and the famous wrestling scene between and keller simply amazing brilliant that'd have to be so weird for meloni to touch private part in front of an icon like kathy bates in that one scene wow pulled that off beautifully pun intended br br i'm waiting for oz the next generation like with star trek etc c'mon let's get it started
