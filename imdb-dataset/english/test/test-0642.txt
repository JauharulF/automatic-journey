<START> and is a wonderful updating of the swashbuckling tradition predating johny depp and his pirate friends the tone is lighthearted with a touch of social commentary but nothing too heavy one could almost see errol flynn and basil rathbone in this br br it starts out in low gear with the introduction of the characters and the establishing of the themes of social inequality and rebellion but it kicks into high gear once the boys hit the highways the robberies are grand and stylish with romantic touches that are the bread and butter of swashbucklers the actors are engaging and help elevate the material a bit which is fairly hollow there's not much depth to the figures but they are played with such charm and skill that it doesn't matter br br has been said about the modern music period music tended to the more serene which seems out of place a classical score with celtic rhythms for the action pieces could work but the more modern rebellious rock and techno music seemed to add an edge to the action since the characters are more legend than reality accuracy in the music seems pointless the pieces tend to fit the mood of the aired scenes so it mostly works well i just wonder how they missed adam stand and deliver make no mistake this is not a serious film it's pure escapism and a wonderful lark tony scott shows some of the visual flair of his father but i don't think we are going to see many oscar nods in his career just yet he seems to understand the material here and pulls off a fine film with time he may prove to be a name to reckon with his father took a while to mature beyond visual stylization and become a more rounded director this is definitely one to watch for an entertaining evening or for a swashbuckling film fest
<START> one true thing puts zellweger in the midst of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to care for her dying mother streep somber and plodding the film studies the adult child coming to terms with the adult view of her parents as they are slowly revealed to be something less than the ideal she grew up knowing as a child an excellent character study and a find production with little to fault ott offers three fine performances by a trio of top actors and some plaintive reflections on life and death
<START> the student nurses is not a typical sexploitation movie sure the nudity and sexual openness is there but it's not all for laughs stephanie scripted a socially compelling well written tits ass movie which confronts the topics of racism socio economic rape abortion medical ethics public health issues human rights the vietnam war free love lsd and drug experimentation four sexy college roommates are taking their nursing at the same time sharon elaine is assigned to the terminal care ward lynn farrell to public health administration priscilla barbara leigh to and karen carlson to psychiatry these four beauties have ample opportunities to disrobe and fornicate of which they take advantage much to the delight of male viewers these are liberated women at the height of the sexual revolution after all and are as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful visceral yet low budget action sequences are interspersed throughout there's a very bloody gunfight at the resistance movement headquarters in which two policemen are shot and killed along with several members of the group an anti vietnam war protest consisting of spookily dressed young people of all races painted like skeletons becomes violent with cops beating protesters the effective trip sequence on the beach consists of beautiful weird and confusing sensory and memory montages with hyper sensual overtones in short the student nurses is a thoughtful and compelling reflection of the times expressed through real women's perspectives since it was written and directed by a woman but it's still fun and titillating despite its sobering treatment of subject matter
<START> i still can't believe that computer graphics are able to create 3d images the moment i heard it from my friends over at a forum i swear to myself that i am going to make myself watch it br br i managed to watch parts of it at a fellow shopping centre where they had many advent children dvds and showed it at a few for sale obviously i was overjoyed but it was still not enough then i headed off to youtube com to search for the movie all i came up with was music video dedications until that fateful day i found it i watched it despite all the distractions because i knew that i have to watch or else i will be called a loser br br enough about me more on the movie as if final fantasy vii wasn't enough they made a movie about it my most favourite part was the end of life cloud's couldn't be better but i wouldn't entirely spoil the show for you you have to watch it for yourself get the dvd now
<START> this is a harrowing movie and it moves relentlessly still it is utterly unique among war films in that it focuses exclusively on the civilian experience the loss of humanity ordinary people undergo during wartime the two young married musicians undergo a slow battering process of degradation at the hands of both sides of a civil war utterly stripped of sentimentality the film offers a bleak vision of the modern world and one i believe particularly recognizable to many europeans with brave intense performances by liv never better and max von sydow likewise for my money the most indelible film bergman ever created

<START> despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes this entry the fourth feels tired ikeda who directed the superb mermaid legend and the seminal japanese splatter film evil dead trap shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise br br a miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot predictable stalking harassing assault and rape ensues br br the staple of roman porno is sex and sex mixed with violence both potentially exciting subjects to be sure but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh a masturbation scene in which a woman forces pencils up her opening via condom is too little kink to late br br the series' rain motif continues and the film's final scene brings relief
<START> i saw this movie at the philadelphia film festival today and enjoyed it overall it is an interesting and adept analysis of the all too common revelation that our parent's marriage was more flawed and difficult than we originally imagined in addition this movie is an excellent example of process of discovering truths about our parent's lives after their death and the issues associated with that however i found the sound quality recording and editing to be relatively poor and annoying it may very well have been related to the specific theater and projection conditions i am not a film maker student or anything and claim no real understanding of the sound production process but as a consumer i found the audio portion of the movie distracting specifically i heard very unpleasant lip smacking noises through out especially one long interview with the younger sister the film and often the background noise level was higher in volume than people's voices for example the scene when a small group was sorting through the mothers papers has anyone else seen this movie noticed anything about the sound thanks
<START> an evil land baron is holding up water to a group of ranchers in order to try and take their properties for pennies on the dollar along comes singin' sandy saunders john wayne who saves the day for gabby hayes and his daughter by going undercover as the villain's newest gunman br br the first of sixteen films wayne made for lone star monogram pictures this tries to cast him as a singing cowboy only with an obviously lip voice the title card prominently features his character as singin' sandy leading one to believe that this was meant to be the first in a proposed series br br yes it's ridiculous but also a lot of fun to see wayne singing songs and shooting guns especially when he does a little ditty before shooting it out with gunman earl br br riders of destiny features a rare villainous role for for al fuzzy st john who clowns around as much with the bad guys as he did playing a heroic sidekick riding alongside buster crabbe and lash larue

<START> i am definitely not a gamer but a couple people in my family and my boyfriend are so a little reluctantly i decided to find out what the big deal was with fantasy stuff i saw dorkness rising and thought it was hilarious it's slapstick but not disrespectful to those that enjoy role playing games also and most importantly people who've never before can enjoy it and not feel left out or lost trying to understand the plot the acting was great and the field shots set were believable this makes me want to see other movies by this production company i can't wait to see what the future holds for this group three cheers well done
<START> this was one of the few norwegian movies i actually looked forward too see it started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches then they made a movie out of it the leads are not pros and you can see that but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away br br norway is known for making crappy movies no offense but i had a good feeling about this one even thou i'm not interested in football i wanted 2 see it the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up there are loads of cameos from norwegian celebrities and players the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them if you're ever gonna see a norwegian movie let it be this one
<START> a wacky chick' flick a beauty contestant winds up dead and the usual suspects are rounded up another entry in the vein of the texas cheerleader this is an average example of its type br br yasmine bleeth turns in her usual wholesome girl performance and jill clayburgh does a good job as her stressed out slightly obsessed mom br br some mildly funny moments listening to the vapid self serving pr coming out of mouths i'd like to own a restaurant so i can give left over food to the homeless ' br br you have to ask yourself what people are using for brains when they think a cheerleader spot or beauty crown is worth killing for br br

<START> greeted with derision by most critics when it first appeared has recently done the rounds of uk tv i remember seeing it on its original release and thinking then that if hitchcock wanted to parade some kind of screen confession about his ingrained he couldn't have found a nastier little vehicle to do so br br but time alters perspective and so what was nauseatingly bad in 1972 might all these years later be worthy of upward re evaluation br br might but not is dross the dross of an ageing director who desperately wanted to exploit the artistic freedom of 70s movie making without seeming to realise that freedom imposes its own obligations notably the need to bring integrity to one's work br br there's none here and not much evidence of the earlier directorial brilliance either the switch from spine tingling implicit to odious explicit is neither shocking nor for a supreme stylist stylish it's just banal the prolonged murder scene is precisely that prolonged without pace without reason without purpose other than the cheapest of directorial desires to appear as contemporary an artiste as say that other acclaimed practitioner of cheap sleaze michael winner br br and it goes from bad to worse with dialog that defies any human provenance not least in the ludicrous diversion into the home life of our dear wooden inspector and his wife's cooking br br perhaps the scene that best sums up and endures as the most explicit indictment of hitchcock's persona is the clunking exchange between two lawyers in a bar where they discuss the serial killings and then agree that at least the women had a good time first by being raped br br i remember my revulsion at that scene back in '72 and it's still because this wasn't hitchcock being clever or sardonic or trying to make some universal point big themes big truths were not hitchcock's forte nor personal preference it was just hitchcock allowing a reflection of his own distorted mirror on life to shine through the texture of the movie br br calling hitchcock's last great masterpiece is to betray little if any understanding of just what hitchcock actually achieved in the way of cinematic trickery cinematic thrills and dazzling cinematic mastery br br is therefore now what it always was a cheap nasty and ham fisted movie that did no service to any of those involved or to the memory of a film maker who really was in his hollywood days one of the greatest there has ever been
