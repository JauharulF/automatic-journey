<START> the movie features another exceptional collaboration between director william wyler and cinematographer gregg the first after worked on citizen kane but the talent of both these men was focused on achieving a perfectly crafted movie understood in the good old american sense as a great story the technical aspects of the movie are covered so as the viewer gets absorbed into the action that takes place on the screen without submitting to the power of the image technique is seen as a vehicle of representation unlike in citizen kane where welles' baroque style almost drew the attention from the story to the way the story was told one of my favorite moves with deep focus in this film is the drama conveyed by the returning home welcoming of homer and al if homer's girl comes towards him perfectly in focus al goes over to his wife also perfectly in focus this is a brilliant move because it shows only through the use of the image the nature of these relationships as we will see them throughout the movie loves homer and she accepts him as he is al's wife loves him also but she feels unprepared to fully welcome him home also later in the film we find out that their marriage has not always been a bed of roses br br wyler is a director whose force lies in being true to his work without feeling the need to boast he wanted to show his audience how hard it was for the american soldiers returning from the war to fit into a society that either didn't understand them or treated them with contempt with a perfect cast and great dialogue and wyler produced a movie that will forever be the template for any other returning home movie the three hours which coincide with the rough cut because the test audience back then never felt for a moment that the action was slow and indeed every scene from the film seems perfectly justified the whole thing is constructed beautifully every character gets a fair amount of exposure nothing is left to chance and it is quite pitiful that hollywood nowadays never manages to bring so much character conflict to the screen explores the depth of the american way of life of the american family and society to an extent that makes other movies look like the children's hour
<START> rutger fans don't be fooled he only plays a cameo in this movie and that's it this movie loses an extra point for that scam i think rutger has a total of about 2 very short scenes and 2 very short voice overs br br the female lead for this film is way above this poor material in looks and talent she's great this movie is a dog and she's wasted on it the story is of a lawyer hoping for that partnership one day at the firm getting suckered into having to cart the boss' niece across country they have several encounters on the road with various oddballs and that is the vehicle for a variety of skits and the dude that played napoleon dynamite is thrown in the mix as a side character for good measure br br this is a road trip where extreme circumstances put our repressed hero to the test and he slowly winds up loosening up a little bit by the end of the movie ah isn't love grand yadda yadda br br only watch this film if you want to see a hot chick be annoying to a dork in a truck for an hour and half
<START> i'm probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy frisk the project that put todd on the map if that is indeed where he is i appreciated that someone had the guts to take on dennis cooper and not back away from the material fairly rolls around in it judging from what he's done since then he's well suited for that type of material and should probably stick to it a would be teen coming out film is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy and i'm disappointed i have to report that br br first off our hero the high school senior joe is far too old in appearance to be playing 18 when we later meet a man who is supposed to be joe's teacher it's confusing as the sweaty faced guy looks much younger than the student he's teaching joe's mother looks younger than he does and doesn't act any older either second in joe's opening scenes he looked like he was either playing or actually experiencing mental challenges to his credit he got better as the film went on and i figured out he was playing young but it just wasn't working it was weird br br it's 15 minutes in before anything is revealed about who what and where these people are and why we should care the second scene in the film is an extended bit of business in a men's toilet room that considering where the story goes later is absolutely superfluous the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all even as a rite of passage for our young hero one minute joe is nervously trying his hand at bathroom stall sex a scene so un erotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the practice the next minute he's an expert at sexual blackmail and violent double crossing this is followed by an extended scene with the character we'll later learn is andrew and that's about all we learn about him other than he's apparently gay but not out yet br br there's a lot crammed in to the 1 44 running time which is about 20 minutes too long i can't imagine how it played with the mind numbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of joe walking around a sub plot copped from gods and monsters with an aged patron who spouts rhetoric pos of nothing played by an actor who obviously can't remember his lines he is conveniently dispatched with in a way dickens might have come up with on a slow week a mix n match almost four way between the boys and their girlfriends a gay bashing toilet tramp a would be wise sage in the form of a nellie queen and hasn't the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of the hooker with the heart of gold as most tired stereo type who exists only to be degraded blackmail theft murder alcohol consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recording br br what you will not find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots we're expected to imagine we're in an airport grocery store office and classroom as all the scenes in these locations consist of close ups and poorly edited to convey the idea of locales that the production must not have been able to afford one thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar either it's the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gay men in maine as the bar never has any patrons in it another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasn't coming from the speakers but was just more of the droning loop music of the score br br plots and characters come and go emotions are unreadable and the dialog clearly inspired by dennis cooper is film speak meaning no humans actually talk this way since we aren't given any information about these characters it's impossible to care about what happens to them it's as if joe et al appear out of the ether one day and might simply cease to exist once the credits roll certainly the character of joe's sister a wannabee jennifer grey who is bohemia crazy seems to just simply stop we never know where she is in la or what her problem is but again does it matter visually the film looks very good at times more a testament to new developments in hi def video than anything i suspect the editing is pretty clunky though there was one great edit joe is posing naked and says i wanted to play sports but and we cut to a shot revealing his butt ha ha composition is also odd at times i thought i was watching sctv's parody of persona when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole scene br br one senses is really restraining himself from making a naughtier or somewhat rougher movie like he usually does and maybe he shouldn't have held back the frothy toothpaste sex fantasy worked nicely i thought though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the movie he produces and directs this sensitive coming of age story much like herschell gordon lewis directed films without gore porn films without sex in them i got some unintended laughs out of this and it wasn't boring it just wasn't very good either
<START> i do not find this show at all funny i actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible disney channel sit coms right now charlotte arnold is an interesting choice to play sadie because she can't act the jokes on this show are terribly unfunny and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit and i mean little bit of acting talent is justin bradley as sadie's brother hal jasmine richards and michael portray sadie's friends there both really stupid and just terrible actors two words that can really describe this show is terribly corny it's corny humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not developed yet now i've explained my hatred for the acting and the horrible humor what's next the whole premise of the show is a stupid idea she changed again not so an ben loving and suddenly nobody recognizes her it's moronic in summation i hate this show however little girls who do not have a concept of funny will enjoy it so i guess that's what they're going for over quality although i can say as much as the first season is clearly better than the second br br bottom line just don't watch any of it br br my rating awful show tv g 30 mins
<START> ok i have to admit that i quite enjoyed house of the dead despite its well documented failings this however was the worst film i have seen since demons at the door compared to the effects are vastly superior however the plot is weak the acting reminiscent of everyone's favourite the porn film and the decisions and actions of the characters consistently verge on the moronic i feel like trying out uwe boll's latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over i am not suggesting that he is really the cure more a case of a different disease but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up ok there it is i have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is house of the dead 2
<START> spoilers actually based on the novel the brick foxhole about a gay man who was murdered by a gi on leave because of his sexual orientation the movie crossfire is about a violently anti semitic gi who because of his own failures and frustrations in life takes it out on those of the jewish persuasion whom he obviously feels threatened by br br getting himself tanked up at a local in d c barley sober us serviceman robert ryan spots joseph samuel sam and starts to get a bit overly yet sarcastically friendly with him it seems that montgomery is a bit ticked off at because he's talking to his best friend and gi buddy arthur mitchell george cooper samuel is also getting through which the neanderthal montgomery can't to the sensitive young gi who's into the arts he's an artist and painter on the outside about war wwii the war that just ended as well as the shaky peace if that's what it is with the dawn of atomic bomb that's now following it in this very dangerous and unstable world what really outrages montgomery more then anything else about is that he's obviously jewish that more then anything else is enough reason for the racist montgomery to want to do in br br inviting mitchell to join him and his lady friend miss lewis marlow at his apartment to have a couple of drinks and continue the very deep and stimulating conversation that they started at the bar this has a what seems like very jealous and feeling hurt and rejected montgomery together with his also inebriated but somewhat clueless in what montgomery's plans for are friend and fellow gi floyd bowers steve brodie later that night go uninvited to place br br with the party already ended with mitchell and miss lewis gone the two very drunk gi's unceremoniously crash the place the fact that in montgomery's sick and anti semitic mind stole mitchell away from him had him whip himself up into a white hot frenzy montgomery and bowers break into home raiding his well stacked liquor cabinet with montgomery taking a couple of swigs against strong objections of very expansive and refined and spirits which is very unlike the watered down and cheap booze that the uncouth montgomery is used to guzzling this all soon lead to a violent and brutal assault on by the angry psychotic and drunk montgomery with bowers out cold on the sofa from all the liquor he consumed who beats the poor and innocent man to death br br the movie crossfire then goes into a long and tedious since it's obvious from the start who killer is investigation into why a wounded and decorated wwii veteran who got the purple heart in the battle of okinawa was murdered with montgomery acting like he's really interested yeah sure in finding killer which in reality is himself this so called voluntarily action on montgomery's part in order to throw off suspicion on himself that he may be the man who killed him br br montgomery is so ridicules and even for someone who smugly considers himself to be very smart stupid in him constantly opening up his big and spewing out anti semitic and racist epitaphs and slurs about the murdered that only throws suspicion on himself and no one else i guess that guy just couldn't help it br br it's not enough that montgomery murdered who in his sick mind was one of them he even murders his friend the scared to death in being implicated in murder bowers who in montgomery racist way of thinking is one of us just because he was afraid bowers would talk to the police in order to save his own sorry neck and thus have the spotlight put on in death br br it doesn't take that long for the detective on the case capt finlay robert young to see through obvious lies and deceptions and then has him set up by having another gi friend of his leroy william phipps who was the butt of all his dumb and racist hillbilly jokes set the arrogant creep up this has montgomery coming back to the scene of his crime where he murdered bowers where a trap has been set up for him that was all capt finlay needed to get montgomery to panic when montgomery saw that the jig was up and make a run for it straight into the crossfire of a police ambush br br dated a bit now but very hard hitting back in 1947 when it was released crossfire addressed the horrors of anti semitism when it at the time was kept under the covers and out of sight in almost every post wwii hollywood movie about the evils of racism in the us and in europe even after the second world war and with what happened to the jews in it when it should have been given the very full and honest exposer to the movie going public that it so rightfully deserved
<START> anthony perkins and sophia loren are absolutely gorgeous in this ca 1840 western that alone however doesn't help a ridiculous story with countless historically incorrect elements br br ives is convincing as the 70 something tyrannical patriarch an egomaniac who swears to see his 100th birthday his wild dancing at a party he gives for his neighbors will make anyone take notice this guy is six always mumbling bible verses he demands respect while driving sons and friends away with his self righteous rantings and emotional cruelties br br the love affair between perkins and loren at first appears absurd but becomes believable near the end there is plenty of drama but not enough to feel good about clearly written for the stage this story was dated even when it was filmed perkins whistles my bonnie in the 1840s although the song wasn't composed until br br critics knocking sophia lorens command of the english language are rather petty i found her english flawless and completely audible as a neapolitan loren speaks a distinct dialect that often had to be dubbed into proper italian her accent however hardly affects how she speaks english as a first generation german american i can appreciate the efforts of those who learn english as a second or even third or fourth language br br desire under the elms is a drama or even a tragedy in the classic sense for my enjoyment is was missing a logical story and an overall pay off for the time invested fans of the stars won't want to miss it others however tune in at your own risk
<START> respected western auteur budd boetticher is woefully out of place with this choppy modern day cops and robbers story that suffers from a strong lack of emotional believability boetticher seems to have rehearsal time and settled for the first take as leads joe cotton and rhonda fleming put little effort into their roles delivering lines flatly and without energy br br mild mannered employee leon foggy poole works as an inside man on a bank job that goes bad and gets his wife killed in the process he escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the wife of the detective who killed his hundreds of cops are mobilized to keep him from getting to the home of the intended who has been moved to another location but wouldn't you know in the films final moments we have foggy trailing feet behind the victim who thought somehow that taking a bus back to the house was a sound move while a company of cops observe and bicker over what action to take sound preposterous you should see it it's all of that and more br br lucien ballard's camera work does a decent job of bringing noir to the suburbs but the editing is lackadaisical and shapeless and it drains the film of its suspense and pace as poole wendell corey is the best thing in the film managing to evoke great sympathy as he transitions from gentle soul to murderer these attributes aside killer uniformly fails in construction and execution making its message clear go western old budd
<START> for those that might send me nasty e mails shove it there is a trend in hollywood where those that create overly quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism garden state tends to be one of those movies br br sure zach star of a rather overrated sitcom surprises people with some talent behind the camera but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving the story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight people have compared this film to the graduate but those type of people are the types that try to independent cinema indie films are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the studio films but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie films than good ones garden state isn't atrocious but its isn't great br br first off the film is too quick resulting in a rather fast reemergence of large into his former life after ten years people tend to act like he never left where's the awkwardness of course the situation is always solved by a quick drug tasting scene which i will say was portrayed rather accurately the film seem to present a lot of emotional inequities giving us the idea that the emotion will come up later in a more deeper and more well thought out way however it fails to deliver on those fronts leaving us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments were quickly resolved like peter grave robbing tendencies it wasn't completely abysmal but maybe we should stop praising the film as something it isn't
<START> ok end of the story is all the kills were a joke on the main character and no one is actually dead yes i know cry wolf did it and did it well but this isn't cry wolf it's scream crap even though the characters don't apparently die we see them get stabbed to death and other ways they are killed even though these kills do not take place as anyone can see them mr director if you're gonna show people getting killed someone needs to see it if they're off camera and the character getting faked killed is alone it doesn't work and until the end i liked a couple of scenes but your end ruined the whole thing br br the acting is horrid especially the kid at the beginning who really thinks he tricked his friends into believing they were playing with his dead grandmothers brains the script is less than half baked though if you're half baked you might like the movie the only reason i gave this movie a 3 is because a they actually made something b they got it released and c they shot on film yes you read right they wasted at least 5 000 on film stock for this crap sad if they'd shot dv they'd had some cash for a better cast and another writer to go through the script and make it good br br i admire the fact that the director made something as most don't but the fact that he comes on talking about how original the movie is br br avoid the movie if it means buying it to see if a friend has it it might be a funny movie to borrow
<START> a root canal without anesthesia is more amusing this movie is disturbing and pointless there is absolutely nothing believable about any of these characters or the plot line what in god's name were these people thinking when they agreed to star in this movie the acting in this movie is so incredibly bad even from actors who are usually pretty damn good the in laws is a funny movie the birdcage is a hilarious movie the big lebowski is a humorous movie this movie is just dumb i cannot even begin to fathom the kind of sick mind it takes to write the novel that this movie is based on i honestly cannot think of even one nice thing to say about this movie it just doesn't make any sense people please i beg of you do not see this movie you will regret it for the rest of your life this movie is not the worst ever made but it is definitely right up there on the top of the list
<START> i too am a house party fan house party i is my favorite movie of all times house party 4 is a disgrace to all of the and to kid n play this was supposed to be part of a series really there was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans yea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a house party movie b c its kind of focused on teens but kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance you can tell how good it was b c it didn't even make it to the movie theaters immature was in house party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacy but they should have represented right they should have left it at house party 3 i am 27 years old and i have been watching house party i since i was 11 when it came out in 1990 16 years ago and i have been a fan ever since when i first seen house party 4 i was like what are they really thinking about there was nothing familiar about this movie that would compare to the previous 3 movies i thought it was a black ferris bueller days off
<START> don't quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there certainly wouldn't have been much comedy i also don't think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times there was much subtle humor sweet feelings and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in real life there are many people whose facial expression doesn't change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right the ending was quite unrealistic i'd say but happy it's a light hearted movie with a feel good ending i liked it loved it actually a serious part was krueger going to and i'm glad they didn't show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly
<START> the theatrics and the drama included in the movie is fantastic but the facts and the research is far from solid when quoting dr where the documentary tries to establish a connection to mary magdalene from dr later clarifies it should be used for literary purposes ie fables of that time not for a historical figure in fact he states he does not believe the ossuary in is mary magdalene he further comments on his public letter that he was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary but rather for information regarding acts of philip a literary work in the 4th century br br so what we have here is a director that took one clip for a 4th century acts of philip fantasy and used it specifically to support a 1st century ossuary inscription a very sad stretch and dr calls the jesus mary magdalene connection as science fiction as this documentary should be rightly labeled
<START> marlene dietrich is magnificent as concha perez the temptress who drives all men to despair in josef von the devil is a woman her performance has nothing to do with 'acting' in any conventional sense but she's incandescent a true star in full command of her material but she's the only good thing about the film she's so good she keeps you watching this dross i doubt if any other actress could have done the same br br the story is an appallingly lame melodrama surely pierre novel was better in which dietrich's amoral concha ruins the lives of two friends played by lionel atwill and cesar romero with a stiffness bordering on and for von sternberg it's an ugly looking movie maybe in keeping with its fairly ugly subject matter bunuel on the other hand thought enough of it to remake it as that obscure object of desire with a greater emphasis on the surrealist aspects of it all down to casting two different actresses in the same role neither film is either director's finest hour and while the bunuel version may be the better film it is dietrich's you remember
