<START> this movie is never going to be on a list of the top 50 films of all time but if you're compiling a list of fun films this isn't a bad place to start liv tyler is amazing captivating and luscious and everyone else is dead on right for their parts it's a 21st century counterpart to tom jones in other words just good bawdy fun i think that this may be tyler's breakthrough film on her way to major stardom with no nudity she oozes sex in this film it's no wonder all the boys give her toys how could they help but do that for a helpless innocent such as liv's jewel
<START> i've seen a fair few films from the far east recently some were excellent battle royale infernal affairs the eye and some were not so great versus the triple cross then there are ones like and which while flawed i still enjoyed br br the basic premise involves the mysterious and horrific effects that a growing obsession with spirals has upon a community sound silly yeah thats what i was thought firstly the good stuff direction was top notch sure a bit over the top in places but never the less interesting and stylish secondly the story was original and like other writers commented very lovelace esq it was interesting what it reminded me most of however was early cronenberg films like shivers and videodrome br br the acting wasn't great but not too horrible either to be honest i was actually bored on a few i felt the pacing especially initially was a little slow my main problem was that it was too silly and funny to be true horror and yet not so enough to be considered a comedy spoilers below br br spoilers some good scenes washing machine and i liked the final shot voiceover at first i thought it ended far too abruptly but about 20 seconds later i realised the meaning and liked the end however because of the lack of seriousness in the story combined with over the top scenes such as the news report at the school ment that i did not care for the characters much in the end the final scene which was perhaps supposed to be a little while in reality i couldn't really care for the girl or her boyfriend spoilers end br br so overall i kinda did like this film but it frustrated me and i think there was real potential in addition to some good scenes couple of other points the main girl is quite pretty and cute and the song that plays at the end is good too i rated it 7 10 br br
<START> it started off weird the middle was weird and the ending was weird but i really really liked it a modern day version of homer's odyessy but that is really irrelevant interesting story and casting clooney was great and i applaud him for taking on such an role so unlike anything he has done or ever will do again lots of surprise stars why isn't holly hunter in more do something different tonight and watch this really different and unexpected flick
<START> it goes without saying that a modicum of allowances has to be made when a true story is being adapted for the big screen but if you shoot a fairy tale that has next to nothing to do with what actually happened why call it bugsy and make the audience believe this was a halfway true story the godfather trilogy processes many real characters and events once upon a time in america does it too but they don't claim to be telling true stories br br spoiler br br in the movie benny has this grand vision of a in real life lansky had to argue him into going to nevada benny deemed the notion of a counterpart to monte carlo idiotic and he'd have preferred to continue his life as a playboy in l a not until much later benny warmed to the idea but of course he's the hero of the movie so naturally the idea had to be his br br in the movie benny wants to use count to get close to mussolini in order to assassinate him because he was hitler's partner and hitler killed jews in gas chambers after all obviously we're supposed to like benny so the screenwriters invented this nonsense in real life at that time nobody knew about the gas chambers least of all benny who was completely uninterested in politics in fact he did use the countess' connection and he did visit mussolini but not to kill him but to sell explosives to him he even met goebbels and goering during his sojourn in italy br br the whole greenberg subplot was nonsense greenberg didn't turn stool pigeon he didn't seek refuge with benny benny didn't kill him that was up to albert at least they got the name right br br i guess it was supposed to be very romantic to have virginia return to benny offering him the money she had stolen the movie even goes so far to tell us via text panels that she ruefully returned the money to lansky after benny's assassination let me just say revisionism just doesn't get more impudent than this br br this list is by no means exhaustive there's the issue with benny's family not living in l a the way benny deals with and adonis the portrayal of costello a disagreeable corporate type lansky a lovable teddy bear benny himself an aging windbag who wouldn't have reached age 12 if he had regularly gone bugsy in situations like those in the movie and what's more who neither has the good looks nor the charisma of benny siegel and many others apart from a few hard facts nothing's right in this flick br br spoilers end here br br all in all this is the one mafia movie that manages to be even more ridiculously bad than harlem ny but honor where honor is due this is a feat in itself
<START> i'm not in favor of death penalties but in this movie it couldn't happen fast enough just to end the movie i don't understand why this movie is rated as high as it is it fooled me into a bad night
<START> this movie is standard goofy sci fi fare from the 50s in its favor the plot does manage to pull off an alien invasion without actually producing the aliens themselves but come on now if aliens needed energy and could absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs why would they come to earth why wouldn't they just suck it out of a star the only credible reason for the presence of kronos is a direct attack on earth society not the mere collection of energy nothing like that is even intimated kronos may have been built by a superior race but its activities on earth are the most primitive the end that the scientist heroes plan for kronos is based on nothing but pseudo scientific gibberish it amounts to the reverse the gambit which has been used so much in bad scifi it has become a joke in itself low and behold this causes our unwanted visitor to release its collected energy no one in power seems to care about the impact the release of that much energy which by the film's end includes among other things the entire yield of a hydrogen bomb will have on the surroundings and unfortunately by the time the movie ends the surroundings are the suburbs of los angeles whoops
<START> every time i've seen this movie i get the same impression some parts of it are so amazingly stupid bad that they crack me up they aren't intentional and there are a lot of them the rest is just plain bad stupid and or irrelevant a movie like evil dead gets credit for being bad at it's own expense because it's the intended result it' stupid and cheesy because sam raimi succeeded at what he was trying to do this movie doesn't have that excuse it's stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers failed so miserably the crap result gets heaped on top of the crap writing and crap performances to make it a shame that the lowest rating a movie can be given is one for ' watching this movie has the same effect as listening to a billy madison essay everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i should be able to give this movie something around a 5
<START> a rich old lady calls on a flirtatious divorcÃ©e to woo a lothario away from her silly soon to be married granddaughter br br let us be gay is an interesting little domestic comedy which features some tart dialogue courtesy of celebrated screenwriter frances marion good performances while perhaps a bit mawkish at times this can probably be blamed on the difficulties with early sound technology which tended to limit action movement br br norma shearer can be credited with appearing in this minor film rather than using her undoubted clout as irving thalberg's spouse to insist upon only a grade pictures she is especially effective in her first few scenes where dowdy flat makeup makes her almost unrecognizable her extreme from goose to swan could only happen in hollywood but it's scarcely profitable to spend much time worrying about that br br rod larocque doesn't come off too well as shearer's adulterous husband quite popular during silent days the talkies were not especially kind to him and his career would suffer here his role is not in the least sympathetic and one has to wonder what masochistic impulse moves women to desire the cad so much br br magnificent marie dressler is on hand as an eccentric long island dowager as a great friend of frances marion one can easily imagine that the part was written expressly for her full of cranks she is very humorous however the tremendous warmth essential goodness which would very shortly make her hollywood's biggest star are largely missing br br among the supporting cast hopper scores as a slinky society serpent as does wilfred playing a comic butler movie mavens will spot little dickie moore as shearer's young son elderly mary gordon as her housekeeper both uncredited
<START> think jumanji but with a death curse a bunch of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that takes the life of some one who is playing it supposedly it was made from the skin of a witch during the spanish inquisition and carries a nasty curse br br okay undemanding and just sort of watchable tale isn't anything you haven't seen before frankly its a been there and done that story that hits all the right buttons in such away as to have no real surprises far from the worst thing that syfy has run but certainly its not the best there are better choices out there but if this is your only choice you won't completely hate it
<START> if it's an art and essay film there is not enough art not to mention essay br br if it is a thriller there is not enough thriller br br if it is a teenage drama there is not enough drama and as far as teenagers are concerned there is not enough and too much nino br br i thought it could be a trailer for tony hawk's forthcoming movie but there is no tony hawk so i guess been cheated it's not tony hawk biopic br br if it's an action movie it lacks explosions which would have added some interest to it or at least would have make jump the sleeping ones into their chairs br br most of the characters seem to be dead inside but it's not a zombie movie in fact if it is a movie there is not enough plot if it is not a movie it lasts too long to be a music video br br if it's a music video well it's an album i will not purchase
<START> a lecture over the life of the tormented magician named ray charles his pulses on the piano made fire music and his nostalgic voice created exciting cool tunes each barrier that ray was facing never kept him down and he found his way all over conflicts a real lesson a great team of producers help recreate the era and armed with great costumes hairs and settings one will follow ray's story believing its true direct filming an icy music freezes and goosebumps the audience with clever sound editing but the most important part of the movie is jamie foxx his acting is really superb the most diamond polished acting ever seen he lives his role he is the ray of light
<START> all of the great horror movies of the 70's 80's and even the early 90's from psycho to texas chainsaw the original not that warmed over wb crap to silence of the lambs the characters in these movies were based upon the crimes of ed gein the writers and directors tapped into the true story for the inspiration for creating some of the greatest fictional movie killers of all time br br the old horror films were great because even though the crimes were loosely based upon the facts of the case of ed gein they were truly fictional and far removed from the true story br br in the case of this movie they've created a fictional horror film in which they tried to capitalize on the true story in order to sell a cheap poorly acted love story between two characters that nobody really cares about in fact in a good horror film these two characters would have been excellent victims br br end of lecture br br in short this film was like wearing clammy underwear on a cold afternoon sipping on a nice cup of chilled vomit
<START> all you need is great house a babysitter and a phone simon west directs this thrilling and chilling remake of the 1979 original this version is more of a thriller than a horror flick emotionally tense with an escalating fear factor jill johnson camilla belle needs to work off an excessive cell phone bill she takes on the task of babysitting the two children of dr and mrs derek de lint and kate jennings grant the house is a beautiful wood and glass masterpiece secluded and peaceful the kids are already in bed the wind builds and is joined by down pouring rain the phone begins ringing ringing ringing the babysitter is soon in a frantic mode of survival in fear of the creepy stranger on the other end of the phone br br belle is great as the innocent smart and strong teen babysitter the voice of the stranger on the phone is that of lance henriksen while the physical stranger is played by tommy also featured are katie cassidy and brian kudos to james dooley for the atmospheric original music
<START> let's not fool ourselves okay we all know that this film was made because of the success of the grumpy old men movies unlike those however this travesty has zero humor and very little heart br br gloria dehaven is the sole shining light to be seen it breaks my heart that she was finally given the chance to show off her skills to a new generation of moviegoers only to end up in a piece of dreck such as this there was a touching scene which featured her being stood up by someone she was falling in love with her fine performance was the only quality acting going on in out to sea everyone else is just going through the motions 2 10
<START> the box is why i originally picked up this movie and the back is why i rented it but i soon learned that i had been duped i had thought this movie would be something like a road trip american pie deal but i was wrong this movie is one of the dumbest i've seen in a long time the unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you the acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy it appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building go out and get or road trip instead i can't believe national lampoon put its name on this don't buy it don't rent it don't waste 2 hours of your life on this
