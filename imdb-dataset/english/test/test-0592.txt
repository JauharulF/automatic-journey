<START> this movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not intelligence and good messages accepted is the story of a kid named bartleby justin long who gets rejected by every college he applies to his parents are incredibly strict frustrated and disappointed so bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids not everything goes to plan and the movie is about them winging it but behind this plot which sounds ridiculous there are good messages morals and a new outlook on the american educational system the college they create south harmon institute of technology accepts those who did not get accepted anywhere else the message is that you do not need money tradition or fancy books you just need a desire to better yourself they are a completely unorthodox school but what the movie teaches is that thats still ok and different whether its a person or a school is not necessarily bad and that every one no matter should be given the chance to better themselves despite whether they are ' its a message of non and has traces of anti authority sprinkled in as well but not only are messages great its hilarious haha i laughed very hard the humor can be subtle but can also be blatant as well and is a great mix fraternities beware
<START> this movie is very similar to death warrant with jean claude van damme and also has some similarities to island of fire with jackie chan and i also heard that there is some other very similar action movies but this film has a much better action than death warrant or even island of fire that's right the jackie chan's movie rarely american action movies has such a great action sequences though there was many negative reviews on this film it easily beats most of the action movies of that time who were more successful there were many martial art's scenes david bradley was fast as bruce lee in this film and what else was good that fighting scenes were much longer than in most of the american martial art's movies the shoot out scenes were similar with john woo's movies maybe not that good but still very exiting there was also many impressive explosions and one great chase scene i've seen some other david bradley's movies but this one yet is the best in terms of action ok this movie has some cheesy moments but which movie hasn't the acting was decent charles napier was incredible and his character was real tough adam clark who played squid and yuji who played the main bad guy were also very good other actors acted pretty well too though the acting isn't important in this type of movies if you are action movies fan i mean the real action movies fan who really can appreciate the good action than you must see this film
<START> no i have not seen the original series and i won't compare the two if i had this series is filmed in canada in vancouver and victoria british columbia the series is well written in a different story each week some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling i loved the afterlife episode with clancy brown and barbara and the episode with the irresistible brent spiner as a in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species it's funny how the lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens like v but anyway he has three days to program a man who is totally brainwashed in serving the alien species on earth the stories are usually a little out there but very entertaining to watch
<START> the family happiness is crumbling when the from the beginning rich father ward michael ontkean gets poor and cannot support the family any longer then the mother faye jaclyn smith has to take the role as the breadwinner in the family and starts to work in order to support the family and at the same time periodically alone has to manage the family life not always that good but as good as she can the family life hardly gets easier when the father learns that the son lionel joe stargate atlantis is gay and is living together with his lover john joel the also an old family friend resulting in that the father makes clear to lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family lionel is the one who meant the most to his sister anne leslie during her up bringing since the family neglected her anne cannot stand the fact that their father have cut the cords with lionel and therefore she run away from home as this wasn't enough the son greg brian krause charmed enlists in the marines and is sent to war the storyline in this film can on some occasions feel a bit thin in spite of that it still has a lot of realism in it which makes it well worth seeing since this film illustrates many sensitive relations and situations i would believe that it is best appreciated by a mature audience even though it wouldn't hurt for teenagers to see it and get something to think about before adulthood
<START> out of the top 24 lesbian films in my library i must rate this one as the number one film of all times this film will go down in history as the best in it's genre it is a story about a girl rachael stirling who goes from riches to rags and from rags to riches with her first love hawes popping in and out of her life it is set against a victorian background in the 1890's which makes it an ideal setting for some of the best entertainment in the industry this film spared no expense for music and costumes and the make up rachael and wore while on stage in the halls only added to the film's diversity br br no matter what kind of films you favor i can guarantee this film will not only amaze you but will keep your attention through all three episodes this film will be played and enjoyed for decades to come the unrated dvd collector's version is a must for anyone's library rachael stirling and hawes was the best choice for the casting in these two roles and they played them extremely well
<START> the battleship potemkin was said to have been a favourite of charlie chaplin it presents a dramatised version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the russian battleship potemkin rebelled against their officers of the regime br br the film is a textbook cinema classic and a masterpiece of creative editing especially in the famous odessa steps sequence in which innocent civilians are mown down in the bloodshed the happenings of a minute are drawn into five by frenzied cross cutting the film contains 1 300 separate shots and in 1948 and 1958 was judged the best film ever made by a panel of international critics the battleship potemkin is in the public domain in some parts of the world
<START> nice combination of the giant monster and samurai genres the giant monster majin god of the mountain is an aloof and forbidding figure that comes across very much like the old testament god raining destruction and punishment on those who his holy ground but it's interesting to note that what finally awakens him is not the suffering of the people but a pointed and personal insult it's beautifully photographed with solid acting great miniatures and a wonderful score by the great akira majin is not a 400 foot monster like godzilla he's 2 1 2 times normal size so the evil samurai he stomps into the ground get a good look into his contemptuous eyes as he bears down on their fortress and smashes it to smithereens not much in terms of extras but it's nice to see this forgotten minor classic rescued and restored to the digital format
<START> the most intense and powerful film i have seen in years there have been other films before that delved into the vietnam vet but nothing compared to this emotionally heartwrenching film as a typical american suburban family circa 1972 comes apart at the seams revealing the scars that vietnam has left on our all of our collective souls the cast is a fantastic with all four actors with kathy bates a stand out giving riveting performances what is wonderful about this film is that you take no sides but understand all four characters and empathize with them even though all four have divergent viewpoints and needs there are scenes in here that are so powerful as family secrets and feelings are revealed such as the confrontation between son and mother that will have you emotionally drained and in tears of anguish i actually cried in this film something i rarely do the shocking end is a stunner a much overlooked film that should be seen i rate this 1996 film a 10 10 a superlative piece highly recommended especially in this day and age with again our country embroiled in a hideous war our headlines shouting of atrocities and again our young men and women returning with deep psychological scars with their deep pain of deeds done in the line of honor a must see film
<START> some spoilers prc quickie that has j carrol naish playing dr igor who's not really dr but an impostor who took over his identity back in europe br br the real dr had a affair with dr wife that lead to him to murder the real dr and then having his wife lenore infected with that made her look like the elephant man's sister this was done so that no one would ever want to look at her and he could keep lenore all to himself but the disturbed lenore later got even with her insane husband by killing herself br br this nut the fake dr then spots patricia lawrence wanda mckay one evening at the theater where her father tony ralph morgan a world famous pianist is giving a concert enchanted by the lovely patricia who's a dead ringer for his dead wife lenore dr becomes obsessed with her and goes to extreme lengths to marry her even though she's want's nothing to do with him br br after getting ridicules in his efforts to get patricia to fall in love with him by sending her flowers with syrupy love notes attached to then as much as five times a day tony goes to see the crazed dr to tell him to stop annoying his daughter it's then that tony ends up getting knocked out by the good doctor who has him injected with a dose of that turns him into a somewhat unsightly fellow with his hands and body swelling up and not being able to play his beloved piano tony is told by his doctor dr adams sam flint that the only one who can cure him of that dreadful disease is non other then dr the person who gave it to him br br the movie has the usual sub plots with dr assistant maxine who's also in love with him jealous of the phony doctor making a play for patricia there's also dr hulking butler glenn strange who like his pet gorilla is just a big clumsy oaf who can't even subdue maxine who's less the half the size strange ends up getting on the head and knocked out cold by patricia's boyfriend bobby blake terry frost as for the gorilla he turns out to be but a big hairy wimp when he also tries to do in maxine and is chased away and locks himself back up in his cage by the pet dog ace dr in his desperation to get patricia to marry him promises her to cure her dad only to have her father break out of his chains and in the ensuing struggle with him ends up shooting dead with his own gun br br there is a happy ending to this whole mess with maxine who knew as much about cure for as he did injecting tony with a secret serum that made him as good as new the movie ends like it started with tony playing the piano to a packed and cheering house at the local theater
<START> this is a beautiful funny vivid film it's even better than nuovo cinema paradiso which it parallels but doesn't replicate the story completes a full circle and had the theater beaming as the credits rolled a hundred years after this story takes place we're just as intrigued by flickering images in a dark theater
<START> i had never heard of the clearing until i was really bored one day with some friends in the local blockbuster and it grabbed our attention the description on the dvd jacket grabbed our interest but once we popped it into the dvd player the boredom was only beginning br br the story was dragged out for waaaay too long it seemed to follow the same outline as other movies which include a kidnapping the most suspenseful parts were in the beginning of the movie however after that the outline was followed exactly and that made the clearing unoriginal the flashbacks were too many in number and the grief of the victim's family provided nothing interesting nor enhanced the nature of the film and i also found that i did not like the ending so that probably led to me not liking the movie at all br br the acting was not horrible it wasn't the greatest though robert redford has given much better performances willem dafoe's tragic character was the only one i really saw develop throughout the story line and the viewer only really sees that change in the last ten minutes or so in the movie helen mirren's portrayal as robert redford's wife was flat and sort of followed the same generic mold as other movies which include a tragic and heart splitting event br br in my opinion the clearing is nothing to rave about use your movie rental money on something else like garden state perhaps
<START> corben bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters we watch as the staff at a radio station takes reports br br its has moments but mostly it plays like a lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood there are some really good ideas here but they just don't work actually the film's ideas are better handled in a film called which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything this shows us stuff and it just seems cheap given the choice i'd watch again rather than watch this film again
<START> this is the very first three stooges short with shemp that i saw and it is one of my favorites br br that is what i really liked about shemp when he returned after curly's stroke he did not try to be like curly he was his own character and that is what i admire shemp is my favorite third stooge i like him more than curly but i like curly as much as i do shemp shemp is great he's funny he's silly he's shemp br br i really loved the scene where he dropped the nickel and moe got into the booth with him to find it and they ended up getting tangled in the wires and really badly hurt br br but what i really thought was scary was when shemp had his face smashed against the glass of the phonebooth he looked like a deformed professor br br poor shemp he had a lot of bad things happen to him in this short but that is just typical three stooges they always have a lot of bad things happening to them br br this short is another must see for three stooges fans br br 10 10
<START> believe me i wanted this series to work but the early departure of kevin kilner dealt a near death blow after season one robert just wasn't right for the part and jane did an admirable job as lead but the series just got too messy and confused at that point i don't know what happened in season five what a mess sometimes its time to drop the red cape and just stick the sword in the bull if you know what i mean the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita as the two in quiet conflict if not for their talents and well written dialogue they would have been two weird bald man chicks in a b movie series br br if only this series could have ended at season 4 and picked up later by syfy
<START> i was surprised as i watched this movie how much it had me no the actors didn't act like typical 'hollywood' actors but that's not always bad either as this film proves quite different from the disney standard it is a refreshing turn none the less they also give you a taste of what it was probably like without being a movie everyone should both see and enjoy many people love arguing over in any movie of this type but just getting the basic idea has plenty to offer mild gripe east and west germany viewed on any map would have west germany on the left side east to the right the movie at times sets you back slightly because about half of the scenes have west germany on the right side of the screen and other times on the left side even during the same events they shift back and forth perhaps just a little more consistency would have avoided this mild distraction go see it
