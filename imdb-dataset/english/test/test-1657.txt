<START> this film is a brilliant retelling of shakespeare's classic love story complete with kinky sex body piercing and dismemberment it does follow the same spirit as all the other troma movies except combat shock that sucker was depressing but it's not only for troma fans anybody who appreciates lowbrow visuals and a hilarious script will without a doubt fall in love with this movie br br don't expect pretentious artistic wannabe crap like the version of r j with claire danes and leo dicaprio this one knows its a silly movie and draws its humor from that the acting is also surprisingly good and you can just feel sammy pain as he tries to put his brain back into his head br br the soundtrack which contains many original and high energy bands like the wesley willis fiasco supernova and the is also four star this movie should be viewed by all because it remains faithful to the original story while still being jam packed with troma's trademark gore sex humor
<START> i love watching australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing the dvd cover looked promising but you know what they say don't judge a dvd by it's cover br br i also noticed that it won best actor for an award but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is pathetic it just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should really focus on one part of film making and get it right before spreading himself too thin the music was pretty ordinary the story really didn't go anywhere it was just a sequence of fights strung together with poor script and cheesy dialogue br br i will say this to all aspiring filmmakers though watch this film it will give you hope that your film will win something at some festival br br however good on them for getting in there and having a go hope they learned some lessons and their next venture is a little better
<START> this movie should be retitled sex in the 70s in a part of new york city called greenwich village and chelsea br br this movie does little to talk about sex in the 70s except focus on the environments of public and private sex spaces in new york city i doubt that the manhole bar was symbolic of actual sex in the 70s and that kind of sex is much more prevalent in the film br br don't get me wrong the time period looks like a blast and it's rather important to document the scene to which the film refers but as far as calling this film sex in the 70s the title is a bit misleading technically it's no oscar nominee but the rawness of it feels appropriate for the subject br br overall an eh
<START> there really are no redeeming factors about this show to put it simply its just terrible absolutely dreadful it's just a dreadful reality show not only that it's dreadful fiction br br imagine this a bunch of overly imaginative teenagers get together one night and go hey let's make a paranormal show just like ghost hunters and whatnot so they grab a camera harass local residents and film random landscapes behind a painfully trying to be dramatic yet failing monologue this show is basically a bunch of teenagers running around with a home movie camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary the only difference is this show actually has a budget and writers a wasted budget and terrible writers br br oh the problems how do i count thee well first off let's talk about this from a personal level i am not a total skeptic when it comes to the paranormal i am willing to believe in whats paranormal and whats not and i'm sure there are a lot of people who feel the same so if you're going to do a show about the paranormal you have to do a good job convincing the viewer that what they're seeing is either paranormal or not because the viewer can easily believe otherwise i hate to compare but i don't see why not at this point take ghost hunters for example in ghost hunters you can tell that the cast is leveled with the audience they're not totally skeptical yet they're still willing to keep the possibility of any paranormal anomalies in mind they have to look at something and be willing to say this is possible that its simply nothing and with that in mind they set out to try and prove themselves wrong they use technology and several other gadgets along with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal along with bearing the fact that what they may be monitoring could be nothing in mind not only are they trying to convince themselves what is real and what is not in the process they are trying to convince you that element of doubt is not present in paranormal state strike one br br in paranormal state the cast simply says there's this spooky place and its haunted so we're going to find some spirits and immediately you know and saying to yourself okay convince me otherwise the cast is not professional in their interviews in fact sometimes it seems like they're just harassing local residents of these so called haunted areas they have no real evidence to back up their claims besides assumptions and theories and the best they can must up is somebody who claims they can contact the dead with no one ever backing up who this person is and how valid they really are they could have easily just picked some random person off the street and said pretend you can contact spirits for our show and went at it in the episode this just happens without any convincing evidence towards the end of the show they bring this sort of individual out where he does a random painfully scripted reading of a supposed area of how something is haunted in order to convince its audience very very poor effort i feel that one of the main problems with the show is that it feels scripted during one of the episodes the cast gets attacked by one of these paranormal anomalies at times in an attempt to be dramatic these sort of dramatic sequences would make any skeptic laugh and even those who are on the fence realize what they're watching is just a bunch of tabloid esquire trash if the show's aim was to try and convince their audience that these paranormal events are real they're doing a horrifically poor job at doing so strike two br br however there is always the counter just one last viewpoint to see if the show is actually worth something what if the show isn't trying to convince you that these paranormal events are real and are simply trying to entertain you with good fiction it even fails on that level as well if the show's creators were trying to craft fiction to entertain its audience the writing is too poor and even on a fictional level it fails to convince the audience that its cast members are really experiencing the unknown in all its full horrifying glory the writing is simply not compelling and even dare i say boring strike three br br so what remains of this show is simply a bunch of teenagers who are too willing or too gullible to believe in the paranormal simply because its simply much more amazing than reality who set out with a camera a bad script and bad actors to generally just make a really bad horror documentary thats all the show is at this point there is no reason to see it not even for the entertainment factor and there's no reason to care about it to be blunt its lame there are absolutely no redeeming factors about this show
<START> this series while idealized and fictionalized has the quirkiness and good heartedness that does come from living on an island br br i lived in an out of the way part of hawaii for a few years and found some hilarious quirky and fun people in some remote non tourist areas br br every time i see the reruns of this series i fondly compare my memories of experiences in out of the way parts of hawaii with the memories portrayed and fictionalized in key west br br this series is not reality television i hate reality television br br it is from the era when people still wrote creative tv shows give me a young writer who takes their inspiration from the angels in the spray wizards in the palm trees and elves in the any day
<START> by now the game's stale right br br the jokes have been done its all over the creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone after all br br wrong br br the game is still intact the jokes are here folks sure they're all rehash but so was monkey island 2 and 1 for that matter br br the difficulty is well placed somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously hard 2 the ship fighting sub game is badly innappropriate in the tradition of sub games and this game has the best joke of the whole series when asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach always select you don't need to see my identification its worth the price of the game by itself
<START> i honestly found wicked little things to be a very cool and fun horror film my friend had given this to me and i really saw it as nothing but a crappy low class gory horror film then after i watched this i was wrong it was very cool and very good and while ill say it seemed a bit unnecessary at times and while it may not be the best horror film ever its still good i thought the acting was very good especially from the girl who plays the mother she seemed very believable and to me very likable and while it is a little and over the top its good overall i gotta say if the horror fest films are not your style then you should have no business watching this but if you like horror films or a wicked little time than check out wicked little things 8 0 out of 10 stars
<START> this movie is awful just awful someone bought it for me as a christmas present because they knew i liked a good horror flick i don't think they understood the good part all i can say is next year this person is getting slipper socks from me avoid this movie it makes you bitter peace br br
<START> miles o'keeffe once again assumes the role of the mighty ator in this the first sequel to the original film br br what can i say this pretty much represents b movie nirvana br br the plot is ludicrous the script is terrible the acting is hammy throughout the special effects well let's not even go there all in all this movie is a veritable delight br br highlights of the film include ator and thong his mute companion not his undergarments being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave certainly saved on the fx budget there ator battling what has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid and of course the infamous scene br br there's one question i have though at the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when ator supposedly destroys the geometric as the narrator tells us how in the hell did ator destroy it and manage get out alive did he fashion some form of primitive timer detonator or something br br oh well such an illogical ending really only adds to the movies overall charm they just don't make them like this anymore
<START> star rating unmissable very good okay you could go out for a meal instead avoid at all costs br br the tale of the titular adam mark o' halloran and paul tom murphy two heroin addicts in the slums of dublin and their daily about in their meaningless lives searching for the next fix that will make their day along the way they try and reconcile with close family and friends who they've managed to let down and destroy over the years br br i know a lot of irish people like to drink but it seems some of them have problems with heroin too by the looks of this movie i know there is a bit of a drug problem over there like there is in many parts of the world so another humorous take on the subject matter is not an entirely unexpected thing br br i don't recall the last irish movie i saw the film is shot in a style that makes it stand out from any film i've seen lately and judging from that obviously i'm not as enlightened on their humour as i could be the film is rather funny in certain parts but it's obviously another comedy that isn't afraid to raise near the knuckle laughs the scene in which the mentally disabled boy is robbed down the back of an alley is certainly true of what a pair of junkies might do to feed their habit but is nonetheless utterly despicable and i'm not sure if it was meant as dark humour in any way but it certainly didn't put a smile on my face it's also in stark contrast to their previous actions where they're seen showing their soft side rocking a baby to and fro in light of this some may find the ending sad others may see it as just desserts br br overall i just failed to see the point to the film i didn't see any motivation in the 'story' it was telling it just seems to amble along without really involving the audience in any way unlike trainspotting which dealt with similar themes it's an unsuccessful effort for the most part that had me on the verge of nodding off despite it's very short 83 minute running time really no more enjoyable than following two real life junkies around for a day
<START> this show demonstrates the depths to which uk tv pre watershed drama has sunk with these dull scripts mediocre acting poor plots awful dialog one is forced to watch a dvd of any old er episode to see excellent hospital drama br br none of the actors employed on this show seem to be able to actually act br br if you want low quality but easy to absorb soap opera style tv this is the show for you personally i like something with more meat on the bone sadly as with all other uk licence payers i'm funding this dross
<START> i had watched this as a kid but not being much of a jerry lewis fan i had completely forgotten it not that it's in any way memorable the film revolves around impersonation which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star in this case a german officer and while not as bad as leonard maltin claims awarding it a bomb rating it's not exactly classic stuff either certainly leagues behind chaplin's the great dictator 1940 even if comparably narcissistic ironically the scenes prior to the appearance of the would be wacky general offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at nazi expense br br the film was really lewis' last gasp during his heyday in fact this proved to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years it's painfully apparent here that his particular brand of foolishness wouldn't pass muster in the age of mel brooks and woody allen
<START> jaded should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like indecent behavior or friend of the family br br jaded is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society from the beginning of the movie with the first scene you expect more strong scenes br br the raping scene wasn't in my opinion a well created scene i think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie that's why it looks sometimes dull and becomes boring almost near the end br br the performances are extremely good from all the five female characters these women gave strong intense but believable performances that demonstrate the actresses' dramatic abilities br br the legal concepts helped a lot to understand the plot's difficulty because the legal term of sodomy is different from a simple raping from the point of view of meg's defense sodomy needs to be penalized as a raping a huge crime grade b although it's a different crime pat and alex's defense claims that meg enjoyed and asked for it this is where the movie turns interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth the only thing for sure is that the sex scene fits into a legal definition of a crime br br watch jaded if you like legal issues that aren't very common in your society if not give it a try because it's a very good and strong drama
<START> this film is full of interesting ideas some scenes are truly hilarious the dialogs are witty and colloquial the tension in the film comes not so much from the 'murder plot as from the relationship between the characters the film tells two stories in parallel br br the first story involves the characters played by trintignant and kassovitz trintignant is an ageing drifter with a somewhat ridiculous macho toughness who is followed by a naive young man played by kassovitz with plenty of good natured smiles many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters for example when trintignant tries to teach kassovitz how to be intimidating br br the second story tells how a salesman played by jean gives up his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend plays the part with a kind of aggressive irony i wish i could describe this better br br after a while the viewer understands how both stories are connected and they meet indeed in the end in a surprising but also logical ending br br the film is a successful mixture of the witty but superficial gangster films the director's father the celebrated michel audiard used to write and the typical french film with lots of psychological depth and lots of care in the display of emotions
<START> i would like to vent my displeasure at nbc canceling las vegas the show had been top notch for the past 5years tom addition was great he really brought a nice fresh addition to the show what does nbc have now lame reality and night time game shows i mean come on keep the old and tired law and order not even putting jack mccoy as da can keep the show interesting gee let's keep quality program like deal or no deal or ed er should be put out to pasture to nbc is worse now than it was in pre seinfeld cheers days with cable and internet nbc cannot afford to fall flat on its face please bring back vegas i remember when homicide life on the street ended the way it did at least they had a two hour series final hey cbs are you listening please pick up vegas it is a great show
