<START> it is not always certain that by mixing comedians together you will produce laughter the comics involved have to actually like or admire each other or be willing to put up with each other's go west with the marx brothers had buster keaton write the script as a gag man groucho did not think too highly of keaton's ideas and embarrassed him at a script meeting and though some of keaton's gems still appear in the finished film such as the gun that turns into a brush that turns into a gun the film was one of the weakest the marx brothers ever made br br a better film but also affected by dueling comic egos was w c fields and mae west in my little which jettisoned the script for a series of duels of one liners between the leads but the one liners were equally funny so the film remains a success br br but six of a kind is an example of six film comics who worked well together the reason is simple it is really three comic teams working together charlie and mary boland george burns and gracie allan and w c fields and alison and boland were paired in about half a dozen comedies during the 1930s usually with boland as a somewhat bossy wife and as a nervous wreck of a husband fields usually a single act was paired three times with tilly and gus and if i had a million were the other two times skippy always figured out how to control or counter the larcenous activities of her man it the present film she takes action into her own hands with the stolen money that is being searched for she knows that the local sheriff fields is not the one to trust with this as for burns and allan they manage to effortlessly involve themselves with the put upon and boland on their cross country trip by car br br quickly gets to realize what a mistake it was to agree to travel with gracie at one point she manages to cause him to fall off a cliff and dangle from a branch he is relatively helpless when she insists on 1 photographing him on his perch and 2 his grammar the presence of george and gracie's humongous dog ran tang tang is it's name does not make travel arrangements easier for charlie and mary br br fields has some choice moments when he insists on shouting at the quartet he says he's allowed to do so he's the sheriff he also explains during a pool game the improbable story of how he got his undeserved moniker honest john you have to listen carefully to the tale as it is interrupted with his attempts to play pool a few times once getting accidentally by a billiard ball but it does show that there were items that even fields would have had no reason to steal br br oh in the summary line i mentioned a forgotten actor named bradley page he was the man who is responsible for the trouble that charley is suspected of bradley has to have a reason to leave town in order to catch up with the unwary and boland so he telephones his girl friend he tells her to call back his job and say that he has to leave town because somebody has died there is a pause as he apparently hears a question shot back by the girlfriend anybody he says clearly annoyed although the bulk of the humor in the film is carried by the sextet of performers mr page happened to have the most amusingly unexpected line in the film
<START> crossfire is a fantastic film noir that is both a product of it's time and a timeless classic this film achieves this by addressing issues that haven't been brought to the screen before its 1947 release and by being a high quality film that holds up to this day with a good script great look and fantastic performances from it's actors the first american film to take the issue of anti semitism head on crossfire is cemented in classic standing set in post world war ii america a lurid whodunit develops after a jewish man is found murdered br br the story is great its anti hatred theme wrapped up in a dark multiple character crime thriller and along side the anti semitism angle is some great post world war ii dialogue and themes as well unlike other mystery thrillers the audience is alerted to who the perpetrator is almost immediately however the film's story is still engrossing because of the struggle of all the great characters involved are going through while trying to make sense of the situation outside the great overall story and themes the entire script is simply smart complete with meaningful messages and razor sharp exchanges between characters br br the film's captivating story is played out wonderfully by the its excellent cast robert young is fantastic as capt finlay the leading investigator of the murder case finlay's my favorite character of the film he's just a cool character dry as bone and tough as a two by four and stopping at nothing to bring the killer to justice robert mitchum is also great in the film very vivid in his soft spoken army sergeant character due to his superb screen presence gloria grahame gives a memorable performance in her small oscar nominated role george cooper also does a good job as the sick and distressed corporal mitchell paul kelly gives an eerie portrayal of a bizarre character and steve brodie sam levene jacqueline white and william phipps also give strong supporting performances robert ryan ends up being the most talked about performer of the film giving a chilling performance as montgomery and also being nominated for an oscar br br crossfire has a terrific look director edward does an extraordinary job with the film's execution and cinematographer j roy hunt does a masterful job with its black and white picture picture is as dark and dank as its themes covered in shadow with an almost glossy overtone yet also very raw in parts ironically the film's great look was not the result of hard work or even intention wanted to spend more time and money on the actors rather than the lighting so that's what he did less lights less preparation around a 6 hour work day and it resulted in a fantastic looking film not just a well done piece of cinematic art crossfire is also a great example of a cheap film that ends up a rich classic
<START> one of the oddest most strikingly eerie and creepy horror films to come out of the 70's tourist trap even by the loose free wheeling convention defying anything goes standards of its time rates as a real yet it's the picture's very strangeness a masterfully mounted uncanny atmosphere of pervasively off kilter supernatural dread which from the get go registers as powerfully spooky and becomes more increasingly opaque and frightening as the film progresses offering up ample shocks amid a few scattered moments of lovely dream like elegance and ending on a bitterly ironic crushingly nihilistic note with a haunting final image that's hard to shake which makes it such a unique and singularly unnerving experience br br five teenagers traveling through the desolate california desert by car get hopelessly lost they stumble across lost oasis a seedy rundown roadside dive that's one part gas station three parts crummy wax museum and all parts ratty and foreboding the lonely seemingly friendless and harmless owner overplayed with infectiously hammy brio by chuck turns out to be a deranged psychic killer with lethal telekinetic powers brings his freaky assortment of uncomfortably human like mannequins to life and picks off the kids one by one so he can add them to his ever growing collection of victims br br director david the arrival schmoeller adeptly wrings every last ounce of tension he can squeeze from the pleasingly ambiguous and open ended script he co wrote with j larry carroll said script's stubborn refusal to provide some rational excuse for all the bizarre stuff which transpires throughout the movie often wrongly criticized as one of the film's principal weaknesses is actually the movie's key strength giving the picture the scary anything and everything can happen common logic be damned quality of a true nightmare come horrifically to life which never would have been achieved if there was some kind of credible explanation offered for what's happening pino beautifully chilling understated score nicholas von shadowy cinematography and robert a burns' grubby cramped production design add immensely to the film's profoundly unsettling mood excellent performances are another significant plus with the pretty perky jocelyn jones ellie jo turner in the great texas dynamite chase particularly fine and personable as the most resilient and sympathetic of the endangered teens even tanya roberts fares well as a luckless lass who has a knife levitated into her head offbeat and unusual tourist trap is well worth visiting
<START> the three part series ended last night on pbs which i believe was its first wide exposure to an american audience the richness of its text and the unique quality of its filming are high points it seems very novel to view and hear an action play employing the vernacular of georgian england jane austen's filmed drawing rooms being the primary example of that form of speech yet it is the scope of drama overwhelming the senses that makes quaint language fit perfectly into each and every scene such bold exposure to an old reality is evocative of literary giants like tolstoy or shakespeare while at the same time entertaining in the manner of a c s or patrick o'brian sea saga the universality of basic human condition lies at its center br br narrator talbot as played by an actor with the almost perfectly appropriate name of benedict surely not even dickens could beat that one alternates between stodgy jingoism and extreme vulnerability an acting tour de force indeed i cannot recall among this very fine cast any misstep of interpretation that is a tribute not only to the actors themselves but to the director as well br br the most impressive element however is how perfectly life aboard a man of war en route to australia in the early 1800's is presented that is especially true of how the motion of the ship becomes almost a character itself something sea stories rarely take into account except as backdrop anyone who has ever experienced mal de mer in person will recognize it instantly and appreciate all the more how difficult it must have been to recreate within the context of filming br br this is no fanciful pirates of the caribbean some effort must be expended in attaining an understanding of its nuances
<START> robert downey jr in a 17th century wig and dress was enough to make me shudder but i couldn't believe a great actor like sam neill actually took a part in this movie the whole thing was unbelievable i especially like cure for the crazies they dance and hey presto everyone's happy and they're all better i guess i just didn't like the character too much therefore watching a whole movie about his supposed transition from a whoring buffoon into a great physician was grueling br br also i'm not entirely sure but i didn't think the plague as well as the famous fire of london took place simultaneously
<START> it's a deeply stupid humor but i loved it jean is a great actor in this movie is cute it makes fun of all the secret agents like james bond refreshing it's probably the most hilarious movie i've ever seen i already saw it three times and i still want to see it again buy the dvd as soon as you can you won't regret it it's the kind of movie in which you don't need to have a great scenario because it's a parody the only defect is that oss 117 is too short it's a jewel it's not really frequent to see a french movie get success in the usa but i think that this one has everything to succeed trust me
<START> first i would like to admit that bali was not my cup of tea this movie was evidently not targeted toward the masses it's the type that critics would enjoy watching the hype and publicity were quite misleading br br i was expecting something very dramatic like devdas understanding that the story and time period demand it i found the movie extremely slow paced br br i'm a die hard aishwarya fan and i regret to say that i thought she was miscast the role of bali required an actress who can portray herself as subversive not innocent and naive everyone else gave a good performance depiction of the human condition does come across the celluloid to give the movie an interesting theme
<START> well to start off i was like wow this is new so when is the film starting and out of this in between stuff but it never ended the film is just one big in between and after 10 minutes of waiting for something to actually happen apart from water splashing around i just started getting angry there is nothing in this documentry and nothing will be learned completely boring and rubbish
<START> ed wood is rolling over in his grave he could have made a hundred cult classics for the price of this waste hole the worst script in memory it makes x men 3 sparkle like citizen kane the most amateur directing pre k cinematography the cheesiest special effects i'm talking about friday the 13th sequel territory and throw in a pointless revolting deeply disturbed maternity ward sequence the lack of any talent or sensibility that put this garbage on screen is astounding that the industry might reward anyone involved in this celluloid cess pool with future projects ought to be cause for serious alarm
<START> a fascinating relic of the turbulent cultural political aura of the late 60s taking in the class struggle as well which ironically in view of its outdated and occasionally embarrassing conservative views makes full use of the that prevailed for a while in mainstream cinema and which came about as a direct result of the liberal attitude it purports to criticize norman wexler's incisive oscar nominated script is superbly enacted by peter boyle in a powerhouse performance who manages to make his garrulous down to earth yet hypocritical and opportunistic character with a barely disguised fascist streak which comes to the fore in the remarkable violent conclusion likable even admirable indeed he comes across uncannily like a flabbier version of the young marlon brando similar to other generation gap movies of its era like taking off 1971 and hardcore 1978 but also nihilistic vigilante films like death wish 1974 and taxi driver 1976 interestingly enough two of these also feature boyle joe ultimately emerges as an engrossing and powerful drama which could have been a masterpiece if it had had a more experienced director at the helm
<START> it's nice to see julie andrews trying a straight dramatic role here something she hadn't done in awhile but her character of judith wise they didn't try to pass her off as a has the old refined manners and tomboyish hairstyle of yore and andrews enacts 'grown up' as any other actress would interpret frigid it's a surprisingly bland drama set in barbados involving omar sharif not the liveliest leading man around not even in 1974 hoping to make andrews a spy while also slowly leading her into the proverbial bedroom unmemorable outing does have some camp value the james bond like credits at the beginning are a cheesy hoot as for julie she's quiet and contemplative but that doesn't do much for the audience or for the film blake edwards paces the freakin' thing like a funeral from
<START> i don't know if i should be amused or insulted by drivel like this put out by lifetime television for women should be renamed lifetime television for shut in drama queens because i've yet to see a movie that wasn't a tear jerking pot boiler this film was no exception you know a film's going to be bad when the biggest headliner is tori spelling completely a creation of bad plastic surgery and spoiled privilege minus any real talent everyone else matched her in unbelievably bad acting and the storyline was beyond dumb as if anyone could believe any of it if i hadn't have been helpless on the sofa pinned down watching with the same fascination you view a gory car wreck i would have changed the channel
<START> this is a cult classic for sure br br it is tricky to follow at times but then again so is a film like jacobs ladder or even say fight club if you want standard fare then i figure go rent the care bears movie or perhaps an old disney classic but if you want to view the world differently then i would say open yourself up to and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and think br br for me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout so while i have seen some complaints all in all i would say take the film for what it is and enjoy
<START> i bought this 'film' from a gas station in the 3 99 bin for one reason billy drago who is one of my favorite actors he is terrifically creepy and good but that's where it stops the movie itself is a dirt cheap gratingly awful attempt at a horror western and manages neither never mind a successful merging of the two genres the acting besides drago's is so bad i wanted to put the couch cushions over my ears the production values are nonexistent and the script i don't even know where to start br br avoid at all costs unless you are a die hard drago fan like me br br terrible shameful unforgivable
<START> it's a shame that they didn't trust the original enough to build on it br br but robocop 2 takes the great ideas imagination and characters of the original and replaces them with all the stereotypes that sequels have to offer br br the beginning commercial was cute and so was the scene that follows reminiscent of the beginning in guys and dolls but aside from a flash of thought here and there this is one film that is a slow dirty slog down into the middle of nowhere br br ideas are introduced then dropped interesting characters from the original hardly get any screen time here most of the new characters cain juliette are so boring that they wouldn't hold up no matter what the movie and then there's the tone br br in the blessed original paul verhoeven knew how to direct with the kind of attitude where if you cranked up the attitude and the sensibility of a good pulp comic even the most repellent violence would be entertaining kershner although he did direct a star wars sequel doesn't and scene after scene either makes you cringe look away or just tune it out altogether br br and what's with robocop he should be the main thing here right but there's whole scenes where he doesn't even show up and what scenes he is in are so half thought and shakily written that you don't know or care if he's part human or part cyborg since he's all boring br br never have i seen such a rapid fall from grace why does hollywood make such bad sequels on purpose why did the film makers have a bet going br br only one star for robocop 2 the fx are good but the story doesn't even try to match them
