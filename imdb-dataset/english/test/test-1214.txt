<START> oh well i thought it should be a good action but it was not although jeff speakman stars there is nothing to watch only two fight for almost 1 5 hours yak a lot of talking and everything is so artificial that you could not believe it the plot is clear from the beginning if you want good action don't rent this movie
<START> i'd buy that for a dollar br br i did buy this film for a dollar and i've seen much worse for much more br br this is a scottish sci fi film from mark and according to the making of hysterical by the way the production only cost 8000 eight grand that wouldn't pay for half a minute in hollywood nevertheless this is top fun film making if you like things gritty then you're in for a treat these are some rough character with rough voices and harsh swearing i didn't mind but my girl friend did the actors do a fine job and it's interesting to see people that i've never heard of or seen before it meant i had no idea who was going to die first br br if you watch a movie for it's of the visual effects then watch a star wars the effects here are ok but kinda weak in space but the monsters are very well done if a bit like br br does an amazing job with not very much and i'd love to see his take on a real hollywood movie it least it wasn't predictable and i almost fell off my chair when one dude got his head blown off ok so it is a little derivative of other sci fi but for this budget it is an amazing attempt and anyone who thinks making a sci fi film for 8 g's is easy or happens a lot clearly knows nothing about the film industry br br good marks for a good film extra marks for working so hard extra extra marks for a really interesting making of no standard bull here all the problems of production are gone into making it like lost in mancha only with a film at the end but why no commentary keep going scots
<START> no no no that is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film anthony perkins is the one and only norman bates as is janet leigh in her role as marion crane this just seems like a colorized version of psycho with a few mildly different touches thrown in for a more modern appeal vaughn is dull as ill norman and viggo sam loomis seems too much the cowboy compared to the original please folks do yourself some justice don't bother with this one can only wonder what mr alfred hitchcock and mr anthony perkins would be thinking right now br br out of
<START> i saw this at the tribeca film festival in the family section i'm not sure either of my kids really got the movie but i have to say that it was a wonderful short film br br and me' is an interesting short film about the hopes and fears that we all felt growing up in the 1980's which in turn extends to how my kids feel today then we had regan today we got bush instead of nuclear war we have terrorism br br i really identified with the main character and i myself dated a in high school we all felt like 'nothing when we were 16 but it's great to see a film where they discover that everything matters br br again i probably wouldn't have put this in the family section there were a few too many curse words for younger children but it was a wonderful and enjoyable film to watch
<START> hal hartley entry into a european film series is one of his two or three best efforts to date and one of the few available on dvd at only 63 minutes running time my only quibble would be with hartley i always leave wanting more but never so much as this time martin donovan is astonishing as jesus pj harvey is beautiful and interesting as but the high point for me was thomas jay ryan henry fool as satan hartley gives him excellent dialogue and a chance to use his resounding voice to full effect look for three scenes in which a microphone awaits him as if a poetry slam is about to be won by the devil i have read other comments on this film and had to add mine because there is not enough praise going around if you like henry fool martin donovan in anything opposite of sex and or very clever comedies based on biblical ideas get this as quickly as possible
<START> i rented a copy of this one from netflix big mistake the dvd version titled the one armed swordsmen was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent sequential story some of the story was left in separate chapters which you can select from the main menu but the dvd is still a mess don't rent or buy it not that there was anything wonderful about the original story an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense much as i liked seeing wang yu in his prime again after all these years this one is an utter waste of time i've had dish that made a better film than this what the chopped up dvd version shows us is that no matter how silly a chinese script may be you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn out br br but the one armed swordsmen does offer you do the chance to see both wang and shaw brothers stalwart lo lieh beating up smirking pretty boy david chiang it's always a pleasure to see that happen lo plays a sort of second string villain here and serves as a prime example of why some people really need he film is also graced by the participation of taiwanese actor chang yi as the magistrate br br another comment above mentions the obligatory fight in the inn scene there are two in fact where wang and chiang are attacked by a pack of comical barbarians using what look like cavemen weapons making bruce lee noises while they fight none of this makes any sense but that's okay if you're not expecting any clarity or common sense it was fun to watch anyway br br another of this production is that there are no significant women characters there are a couple of female roles but they play no serious role in the action or the plot br br if you can find a copy of the original shaw brothers one armed swordsman movie the one which explains why he has only the one arm and why he uses a broken sword go for it
<START> certainly this proves beyond a shadow of doubt that patricia arquette is what she is promoted to be an actress this is undoubtedly her finest moment of acting and she certainly deserves the credit for her work never in any of her other movies with the possible exception of holy matrimony has she been totally believable and authentic br br plot a young woman finds herself in southeast asia and is suddenly thrown into the political havoc of the countryside she witnesses mass murder and totalitarianism and escapes br br it is one movie that you must see or you have not seen all of hollywood's finest i rank it 58 in the top 100 films of all time br br thanks bob
<START> i would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment i watched this not expecting too much from it the fact is that the cast were superb especially the lead teen female the dark sides of them all came through all were messed up in an not obvious way there was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality the serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children what this movie is is a strong drama thriller yes i would agree they don't do the obvious but you could relate with the messed up teenage heads they did what they did and it is believable also a decent dark ending instead of which could have so easily been an opt out happy one the attention to detail in the movie was fantastic also i very good solid 7 out of 10 a little slow at times but lets a thinking person see where the characters are coming from
<START> i first saw this when it came out in the theater though only 13 at the time i was an avid reader of hard science science fiction stories the technical gaffes of the film are burned into my memory br br some of the following may have significant spoilers br br even as a youngster i knew the premise is silly the rocket takes off for a lunar mission in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew though loose objects float as in zero gravity and because of that the cabin the area with the controls whatever they called it was to maintain the correct orientation so that when they landed why didn't they land standing on their heads and where at least in near earth space the rocket engines had to be running continually with propellant combusting away without an when the engines quit the rocket stopped dead in space and couldn't start going until a phd chemist determined it needed at a little this time the rocket recalled it had momentum and the next thing our heroes know they're near mars even a 13 year old nerd knew such a minimum energy trip would take over 200 days br br they land find the air was breathable though at the time scientific data revealed that the pressure even if the atmosphere were pure oxygen would be too low to do any good they decide to camp outside the ship and even build a campfire they come armed even though they were supposedly going to the moon where firearms wouldn't be needed br br they get a sight of a collapsed civilization encounter stray martians who look just like people develop an anti nuclear war philosophy and those who survive try to get back to the home planet and die in the attempt by crashing on the earth to do that would require such a long orbital period they'd have died of starvation long before approaching their destination br br the film it preceded destination moon used real science most effectively even though their rescue with the oxygen tank forgot about the moment arm from the tank's center of gravity to the output nozzle this film showed woeful ignorance of even the most basic science only the most technologically illiterate should think of it as a science fiction film it's on a par with the old flash gordon serials where their took off from their and climbed in spirals and whose engines were always on br br the story on this one i considered banal and i can recommend this only as a film to be shown to students for them to pick out technical gaffes
<START> see no evil is the first film from wwe films yes wwe word wrestling entertainment pro wrestling of course being that it's a wwe film a wrestler has to star in it the wrestler being glenn jacobs aka kane which is not really important as if you didn't know kane or what wwe stood for you would never know it had anything to do with the wild word of wrestling as the movie has nothing to do with wrestling see no evil is gross out horror film it has some moments were the some people may jump but for the most part it's just saying hey look how gross we can get not that there is anything wrong with that jacob goodnight played by kane is sort of a jason type character his mother tortured him as a kid with strict understatement christian beliefs and has warped his mind now he's a big scary chopping killing machine 90 of the movie takes place in an abandon hotel where jacob stalks six teenagers surprised and a handful of adults i could explain why they are in a creepy old hotel but eh who cares despite it's lack of originality see no evil is well made for what it's supposed to be kane plays an awesome killer and needs little make up to be scary one flaw in the movie is the most annoying possibility people survive i really looking forward to having them being horribly killed but alas does not happen i wish the film didn't have the stigma of wrestling attached to it although like i said the film has nothing to with wrestling people are still closed minded enough not to want to see it because given of course if they are a wrestling hater then again the movie may also make money because wrestling fans will want to see it either way see no evil has top notch effects and little cgi and like i said it's quite brutal so like i say it's good stuff if you like that sort of thing
<START> pierre plays a don quixote character unable to speak living in a world incompatible with modern life he trusts to his homemade weaponry helmet sleeves and spear made out of seat cushions and discarded office furniture just as don quixote rode the man rides his contraption literally transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world soaring above the earth away from the plight of modern man both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world both characters are guardian knights of values unfamiliar to most of the other characters in the story br br unlike tale in this movie we identify more directly with the anachronistic ideals of the main character we can only compare this alien and forbidding landscape to the lush and beautiful world we live in our frame of reference is the fantasy realm which the lone knight perhaps remembers our vision would be one which expects the main character to triumph to vanquish to change his world for the better back into a world of plenty that no longer exists br br we look at this movie and see a true knight among a world of humans as animals don quixote considered himself a true knight among animals br br with tale we can only see the dreamer without really understanding the scope of his anachronistic displacement in besson's and tale we see the new world from the eyes of don quixote because we value the same visions and ideals as the crusading main character
<START> i loved this film a must see for any rod steiger fan producer suzanne and director stewart have brought us a true family film that touches the soul an incredibly well put together movie with a beautiful soundtrack
<START> all i can say after watching the dvds of the first season is that i can not believe nbc green lighted this show it's so different than what's currently in vogue save for lost those who miss the x files just may have a worthy successor not as mysterious or intense as lost i find it to be overall more entertaining br br this kind of extended story is hard to make i mean it could degenerate into childish dribble if most of the elements do not cohere together but cohere they do and i think the cast is excellent the writing sharp the location and props first rate and the special effects very good for a television budget sure it pushes what is plausible but as it does it never gets so silly as to insult your intelligence br br bottomline is that this is great sci fi drama for the entire family i doubt it will be a classic with a long run like x files but in the meantime i recommend getting the dvd if you missed it like i did the first time around this fall my must see shows has just increased by one more series br br ps i just heard it got axed from nbc here's hoping sci fi picks it up
<START> save some very early norris breaker breaker has nothing to offer which can't be found ten fold better on any broadcast channel a pathetic attempt at film making this is one of the worst films i have ever seen in spite of that i did watch it thumbing the fast forward button because the acting was so awful it was comical of course the film is supposed to be an action drama but turned out as a treatise on how not to make a movie everything which could be wrong with film is on screen in this dog if you happen across it give it a peek it's so bad it's funny
<START> this is the worst movie ive ever seen and i have seen lots of movies me and my friends rented this one a evening man we had lots of fun this movie is the worst most boring crap ive ever seen but it makes you laugh u will lay on the floor rolling around to get some air you wonder why just rent it and check for the keyboard playing girl at that sleazy russian bar my mother would make a 1000 times better movie about her the cats
