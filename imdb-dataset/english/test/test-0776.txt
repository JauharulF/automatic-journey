<START> i know this is a made for tv movie and the acting in made for tv movies is usually sub par but it's absolutely horrendous in this film sometimes acting gets so bad it's laughable but in this case it's so bad it's sickening
<START> the greatest compliments to the other commentator here at imdb who asked himself why this series didn't get stuck in its time to last a lot longer like many other series in the 80s did br br it is not true the series would have gotten worse if further continued br br i will at the end of this my comment post some thoughts about the other movie realizations rather attempts of the robin hood legend br br first of all robert you are among us all you live forever br br nothing is as fun as the entire two if one wants three seasons of this absolutely unique series and at the same time absolutely agreeing with the mostly new and revolutionary findings of terry jones' history about egypt greece rome the and barbarians and the middle ages and crusades yes the monthy python terry jones br br if you have seen those brilliant and funny jones docs you will better much better understand all the historical background stuff carpenter the writer of the robin of sherwood series which happens to be the brother of john carpenter who made the thing their third brother makes music intended to tell us br br the writer of dick turpin catweazle and the first two seasons of robin of sherwood called kip carpenter is my movie overlord he's better than all those others who criticize his sword and sorcery element or taken from the robin of sherwood of this series that i can not see or have other non criticism of which there existed a lot back then and still now br br that's why when you get to know this robin of sherwood better you'll be severe you will at first loathe the third season not only that i did myself go thru this and on top of it i have only taken up the first two seasons into my deepest heart despite the fact that the actor of robin left this series because after the series had enormous success he was offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous canadian series called the new of jules verne already the title reveals the emptiness of the whole project went for money and not for fame he didn't stick with his gang and kin i mean as actors br br actors who personally represent the afterwards really in our present time famous and legendary faces and characters of the robin legend the potential of this series could and should have been let blossomed a lot more without any degrading niveau of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues br br again obligatory to say a change of the main role was forced by stupid decision of leaving robin of sherwood for a silly remake series of the verne tales and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story still it is in some aspects a catastrophe br br anyway if one is informed about this and that connery was maybe really advertised by his father but that the young connery did not at all chase away how i thought in the first place then one can absolutely enjoy the 3rd season sad here is that the script was not anymore written by superman kip carpenter so we don't have anymore that critical and free thinking historical background like i e in the witch of or in the king's fool two episodes of the first series that is a funny b historically educating and c brilliantly acted br br don't trust the lion br br unlike many other characters that wished him dead for the sake of their own gain of power richard lionheart as shown in ros and as in real history was a greater authority than john or others but used it only for his wicked idea of the crusade and the war against in france he slaughtered and had slaughtered much more than tens of thousands of christians muslims and jews in the crusades and his soldiers even devoured the children they slayed out of hunger or poverty on top of that after his capture by the muslims in the crusades britain was squeezed out for his ransom 100 000 marks at that time 11th century comparable to approx 30 billion dollars of current value to get him safely back and then he just visited england for a month to return to in france where the norman invaders went first for the crusades one learns that in the episode the king's fool for this new crusade possibly kind of a revenge for his capture richard lionheart again drains the country of money cited out of clive mouth when he lectures robin in being critical with even the king robin criticizes this warfare ruling of richard's he addresses richard himself telling him the poor gave everything to set you free how can you ask more of them richard give me your courage and strength not your words later in private richard orders the assassination of robin br br so the crusaders were the real barbarians br br p s already when i watched kostner in 91 i got upset because after wards i found out in history course in school that richard was not that good just man as displayed by sean connery in his appearance at the end of prince of the thieves well as terry jones would put it it is a lie a treacherous lie sean plays humorist and charismatic and his son does a better job than expected in the third season of robin of sherwood br br again is according to my info up to now the one who left sherwood for a stupid verne series nobody with brains will ever remember or want to remember
<START> may contain spoilers this movie was the worst movie ever i couldn't even watch it all it was so bad this film is actually worse than scarecrow slayer which is saying a whole lot this was worse than terror toons which at least terror toons was funny at times not even the gore in the film was good the shootings were fake and the acting was worse please do yourself a favor and skip this one if you see it at the rental store then run the other way there is nothing good about this film at all if you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch night of the scarecrow or pumpkin head if you want to see an ok new cheesy movie then watch scarecrow i rate this movie a 0 2 out of 10 that's how horrible this film really is the worst movie ever
<START> honestly one of the worst written directed and acted movies i have ever seen seemed like a made for tv movie and a bad one at that i cannot believe that people are still hiring danny huston after seeing him in this movie or that they are still allowing john sayles to make films my husband and i came across this movie on tv one night and got so bored with it we ended up cleaning the house while it was on and it still bored us it made me think that critics have been so gullible with previous films such as lone star which was raved about at he time but didn't really add up to much in the end spend your time on something better anything
<START> this was a pretty good movie that was overall done quite well the idea about mercy won't spoil was original also i think angelina did a good job as one of her first movies the only things i frowned upon were some of the corny fight scenes won't spoil either i liked the first movie and i liked this one as well 7 10
<START> delightful it never pretends to be a masterpiece but it's a mini gem of late seventies british comedy given that the producers wanted to sell it abroad it stars an american the late character actor richard jordan but at least he isn't the usual dull hollywood hunk type surrounding him is the cream of british character acting talent led by a wonderfully waspish and superior david niven br br niven's ivan the terrible naturally gets the best one liners and all the best reaction shots he also manages to be surprisingly menacing and dangerous the moment in the snooker club when he drops the charming facade and threatens richard jordan will come as a shock to those viewers who think of niven as being only a light drawing room comedy star he is filled with genuine power and ruthlessness as we see all at once how ivan earned his nickname all the more surprising given how ill niven was at the time shortly after filming this production he lost his powers of speech to lateral sclerosis known as lou gehrig's disease this is the last picture niven made where you can hear his own voice being dubbed thereafter by the comic impressionist sid caesar br br alongside him you can spot numerous familiar faces from seventies cinema and television elke sommer flashing her breasts in true seventies era politically incorrect bimbo mode oliver tobias michael brian croucher davy kaye etc etc davy kaye gets one of the biggest laughs as he holds up a security guard caught making a phone call who you ringing bloody dial a disc you gormless git br br great shots of london street locations making the film a period patina time capsule of red phone boxes with chunky round dial manual black cabs driven by cor blimey gov cockneys and ladies and gents modelling all manner of deeply dodgy late seventies retro leisure wear and hair styles br br unlike the classic ealing comedies of an earlier era the 'hero' is allowed to get away with his crime and escape to a life in the sun how times had changed the morality code by which crooks in films always had to be seen to be punished had long gone by the seventies with anti heroes like pinky green earning status through their cheeky anti authoritarianism and determination to a at a stuffy capitalist establishment of be suited fat cat businessmen we are encouraged to cheer as pinky makes off unpunished and free as a bird with his ill gotten gains compare that to the ending of the lavender hill mob br br highly entertaining dated in its fashions and attitudes and the stuff of late night cult viewing perfect to watch at midnight after the pubs have shut if you're of a certain age are feeling a touch nostalgic and have always wanted to see david niven in a branch of mcdonalds silently intimidating an american via the use of a retractable telescope
<START> as a long island independent film maker myself and having have had two theatrical releases under my producing directing belt i had always been told of how much i could learn by viewing a fred carpenter production so i was lucky enough to have his eddie monroe as my initiation to his superb budgeting production casting settings and masterful directing talents my heart went out to it's characters it's story and was totally won over by the trick switch ending that brought the film's plot to fruition were marvelously chosen and human emotions in it's characters brought a realistic link to my bonding with all the elements that mr carpenter utilized throughout to his and his film's benefit
<START> yes sure this is a friday the 13th rip off but i have no problem with it it's a good effort the killings aren't that gory but the acting of one girl carries the movie what a scream queen jennifer for a low budget movie the effects are nicely done okay sometimes you can guess how it is done some people have problems with the use of the camera i can't see what's wrong with that it's so strange that so many people dislike this movie i really enjoyed it of course the script isn't original but give me one that is i mean so many slashers are made in the woods maybe it is all predictable but it's a worth see i have seen a lot worser i can tell you that
<START> there is nothing in this that the viewer could point to and call good the acting was dull and sedated the sets and cinematography look like they were developed by someone grew up in a starbucks and tried to make the perfect gap commercial characters have no drive motivation or reason for us to care about them there's such a lack of interest and tension that it's hard to follow the banal action and dialog and the plot if anyone finds it i'm sure it would be as boring as everything else br br this isn't funny it's not romantic it doesn't reflect on the human condition if you want a good stoner comedy watch half baked if you want a good stoner drama watch trainspotting the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of one is because it's kind of fun seeing some familiar faces in the mid late 90's cast which is a shallow reason to give the film even one star but then again this is a shallow movie
<START> the story takes place on the streets of sao in brazil where a young boy named pixote grows up alone without his parents left troubled and with no direction pixote gets taken into a child asylum with other adolescents from the street behind closed doors terrible things occurs within the staff and within the child groups and there is one last trigger that gets the place blown up the last incident that makes pixote and his friends decide to break out and escape from there on begins a journey overwhelmed with strong bonded friendships friendships torn apart love and hate criminal activities and simply chilling on the beach talking about things something someone like you and i also does sometimes br br i think this film is perfect in so many ways because it touches you on so many levels it did that with me anyway the document like style used to portray pixote and his surroundings does it seem more realistic and the actors who really are street children and have lived similar lives helps the humanity in the conditions seem more natural it has a social comment about child abuse too but i think what makes the film so great is that the pressure is on the story and not on the political views the last scene which i find the best piece from the film strikes me as something beyond nothing i've seen before so full of emotions and yet so unsentimental makes this film a truthful believable unbearable unforgettable story tale a true heartbreaking masterpiece which is so underrated br br my vote 10 10
<START> br br to make this short and sweet i hope this movie will not be considered the seminal work for the gener asian of american film making the acting was sub par relying on stereotypes raised voices and exaggerated eye buggery to convey its message chris chan park does not delve very deep into the any of his characters allowing them to remain caricatures of angry frustrated distant uncommunicative asians these depictions do not make characters mysteriously appealing it makes them confusing and unsympathetic i like to think that us asians are more complex than that br br i came out of the movie unconvinced unconvinced that these characters had a life long blood brother like connection with each other to go to the lengths they did to help their buddy out unconvinced that the main character had anything beyond a superficial attraction to his girlfriend unconvinced that hard working immigrant parents wouldn't pay for their son's college education unconvinced that all of the characters were even necessary i e janet who is put to bed in the back of the car and quickly forgotten br br the story line which i actually think had potential was not allowed to come into its own for two reasons 1 flat characters for whom i had no sympathy affinity 2 the plot is overshadowed by meaningless non sequitur scenes such as the donut shop sequence with amy hill which was simply ridiculous and unnecessary br br i commend park for his efforts as i'm sure it took a lot of hard work to even produce the film and i'll even give him the benefit of the doubt this time around as a rookie director screenwriter but i sincerely hope that next time around he'll go a little deeper just because the film is one of the first of its kind about the korean american experience doesn't mean it's automatically good
<START> written by brilliant tv writers gerald gardner and dee caruso which way to the front was the last of the jerry lewis movies until hardly working almost a decade later jerry's comedy is evidently an acquired taste and admittedly he can occasionally be his own worst enemy when he helms as producer director but even in the of his films there are always moments of brilliance br br which way manages to be amusing entertaining and yes quite funny it is somewhat unlike any of the typical lewis films the pace is very upbeat and ther are lots of excellent supporting players a kind of jerry does heroes the whole thing looks kind of like an tv pilot and you will either love it or hate it but hopefully you vill laugh
<START> i didn't watch this show that much when i was little and i think i only watched 1 episode which was about railroads i believe because i liked trains and still do even then i thought it was a baby show i mostly watched arthur the songs are pretty weird too and i don't think it's that educational either they just sing some dumb nursery rhymes this is a dumb show any adults who like it are crazy if you want some good kids shows watch something like arthur mister rogers neighborhood or even better pee wee's playhouse i thought sesame street was boring when i was little but even that is better than barney trust me this show is pretty dumb there are other kids shows that are better than this one i can see many of the reviews here that a lot of people don't like this show now there are some mature people i hope they take this show off air soon
<START> this is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts donald was an english businessman and amateur sailor who competed in the sunday times golden globe race a single handed round the world yacht race br br i was very intrigued by the story after listening to a radio interview from the producer john who is also the producer of touching the void one of the first documentaries that made a commercial success in 2003 i had gone to the cinema with great hope and not much previous knowledge on the historic event and i'm relieved that it didn't let me down for 92 minutes i was led through a haunting story and came out with much to think about br br without any reenactment this film made great use of the limited audio and video archive footage they found and turned it into a compelling story which allowed the audience to understand from a personal level the story unveiled itself as people who had direct links to the events including his wife and his son and the eventual winner also the only one who made it back out of the 9 competitors robin knox johnston gave their own accounts of what happened almost 40 years ago br br logs journals that he kept during the days at sea are so haunting that it made it much easier for me to come to understand what being in total isolation can do to a man while body was never found the other competitor nigel whose yacht sank just weeks before claiming the prize for fastest passage committed suicide three years later after unsuccessful attempts at properly completing a br br everything could take its toll especially the sea br br the director louise osmond was also at the q a session after the showing together with producer john i had no idea that it's a female director and that just came as a very nice surprise the film is getting a limited release in the uk a couple of days in certain cinemas catch it in cinema while you can unless you have a state of the art sound system that can recreate the sound of the bashing southern ocean then i'm sure they'll soon have it on dvds too
<START> i would watch this movie every time it was on cable and it never got old who can forget some of the best lines in film history johnny's fat boy burgers johnny's fat boy burgers and look between the giant melons i used to wish i could run all over the city in a treasure hunt as fun as this it's an all time fave and i'm happy to hear that it's out on video i'm positive that this is where mtv got its original premise for the road rules series
