<START> i've been on a bad run of films this is a clinker about an arson plot and a psychopath tom skerrit whom i really enjoy was pretty young here he is a builder with a passion but he has a partner whose profit motive includes over insuring and burning into the mix comes an agent who is drowned his daughter and her nut case boyfriend james mason plays the insurance investigator any idiot given a little warning would know something was rotten in the nation of australia still they bumble their way the most interesting thing to me was that the huge hotel that was going to be built never got beyond being a bunch of sticks low budget i guess the plot could have been interesting maybe they should have hired a film editor the did half the time you don't know where the characters are but i guarantee a five million dollar payoff would have probably made a close watch on the structure mandatory it doesn't work although there is lots of neat fire
<START> i watched 40 minutes and couldn't bear it any longer Â the television went off and i returned to some light reading lobotomy for beginners br br it was hard to say what aspect of this production was most displeasing dialogue made up entirely of sound bytes or the acting by numbers br br it was difficult to determine the period in which the drama was supposed to take place there were throw away references to lord nelson and slavery but edmund the cleric to be played by blake was the only actor who one could believe inhabited the early 19th century the other bright young things had make up and costumes more appropriate to a 21st century fancy dress party the bleached blonde fanny billie piper being the least credible character br br uk commercial television obviously believes heaving bosoms pouting lips and deep meaningful looks make a good story fortunately jane austen had other ideas br br if you want to find out the story of mansfield park buy the 1983 mini series dvd
<START> is almost as bad as a science fiction film can go br br i can hardly find something good to say about this film the premises are completely wrong a comet is supposed to hit the moon and cause catastrophic damage to earth but nobody believes the scientist who predicts this a whole underground city plus a launching pad for nuclear armed rockets is build in the california mountains without anybody noticing when the comet nears earth the news make it to the tv and newspapers hardly a day before the event and so on and so on br br neither does any kind of emotion make it to the screen is the genius who discovers the comet and builds the underground city a savior of humanity or a beast the director or dennis hooper who is playing the role did not seem to decide until the film was done and actually it does not make any difference because acting and directing is so confusing that you end by wondering what does this film try to say the special effects are so cheap that not only that they cannot be convincing in the era of computer effects but they could not have been convincing even in the 50s four decades before this film was made br br a total waste of time
<START> another first this french movie is my introduction to the world eric rohmer perhaps i'm a bit hasty when i say that this is probably my last rohmer movie but i was immediately turned off by the way rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point there is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that i thought was never going to end honestly no matter how much i tried i couldn't understand why rohmer is so highly regarded among cinephiles he struck me as being one of those obnoxiously petulant people who are filled with hot air if this is a sample of what his movies are about i'm not interested i don't care much for french cinema usually reflective and speculative to a fault so maybe i'm biased
<START> intense funny witty and more than anything social comedy on the ways of adult dating and it's results be it good or bad mohr and nicholson are engaged couple two months away from a wedding date when a bizarre event at their engagement party forces nicholson to re think the relationship and start to date other people so she won't feel so pristine when it comes to sexual experience this leads to a disaster of events following mohr nicholson and their cohorts very intelligent and needed in this time of clumsy condescending comedy while containing your usual variety of comedic sexual and frustrated characters especially charles as a sexually frustrated sex fiend very annoying who even they seem to get the right feel to this heart felt commentary br br the film goes the way films should go these days showing that guys are sensitive at heart and have morals most of the male characters are the moralistic straight forward eyes while the woman are the fresh faced street who will stop at nothing to get pleasure guys will be appreciative of the message made for guys with self respect however it is easy to assume that most males who do see this film will use it's message of male sensitivity cover up any flaw or trait that a female might find offending still the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for it's male leads particularly those of mohr richter and finding the director in a cameo as a sales man br br the females are by far the most promiscuous as they speak of nothing but pleasure and what it would be like to with someone else they have amicable traits though even though they are covered by the image of sex driven kittens very funny stuff br br on another level the film follows some of it's ensemble into different relationship work richter meets up with a stressed divorcÃ©e a very remarkable and noteworthy performance by the always reliable helen slater named penelope who is divorced with a son who hates her for splitting with his father as the two go deeper into a relationship human interest is revealed and both the comedy and tragedy of divorce and starting anew are studied br br by the end of the film mohr and nicholson have become way to deep over the heads to see what's coming next and it is up to what they have learned about each other and themselves to decide what will come next it becomes appropriate and dramatic at just the right time br br direction is emulated very well when the characters learn to face each other after all that has happened with the right ending br br all in all this film should have been released nationwide and i should hope that it is up for some academy awards maybe helen slater can finally get the recognition she deserves anywho this film is a no hits miss give it all you got romantic sex farce displayed very maturely and aesthetically br br great film
<START> oz is a great series one of televisions underrated shows it has a certain relationship to soap opera in that something evil is always happening and it is the unfolding of each instance of evil that fascinates from my discussions with people who are actually in prison it rings true every interaction has some machination working in the background behind every action there lies a scheme a plot to do someone else in i like this series so much that it is one of the few tv shows i have bought completely on dvd br br and yes i agree with the writer before me who commented that there are elements of satire in it the character in the wheelchair who offers his jaundiced view of life does so with a certain bit of ironic humor
<START> warning possible spoilers br br 'rock star' is one of the solid rock movies i have ever seen the original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period he is not only playing their music to the note but also living the life of his idols when his friends in the tribute band expel him in search of some originality the destiny plays him a good turn and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band a dream came true well almost while starting to live the life of the famous including the drug and sex excesses of the rock scene of the 80s he will also have to face the problems in relationship with his supportive girlfriend and will be eventually need to answer questions about creativity and having a saying in the music of the band br br i liked the film one of the reasons being that it is one of the first times that the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic manner fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack the overall idea is original and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being rendered in a sensible and balanced manner acting is quite good with mark wahlberg better than in most of the other action flics i saw him lately and jennifer aniston in tune with the nice girl who knows a lot about life role more problematic is the ending which is quite conventional and may disappoint it looks like the main character after quiting the big and famous band has found his own creative path however in an ironical twist the music he is playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie br br 8 10 on my personal scale worth seeing however expect exposure to a high dose of metal if you do not like this kind of music you may chose to avoid this film
<START> spoilers br br i don't care what anyone says this movie is friggin' hilarious this is the sequel to jack frost a movie about a killer snowman the snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber but the truck crashes with a truck carrying dna manipulation chemicals that make human dna bond with dirt or in this case snow the first movie was just boring and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him br br or so they thought br br this movie takes place about a year after the second some scientists resurrect jack frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals no explanation is ever given for why they do this they just do meanwhile the who arrested frost in the first is going to the bahamas unfortunately the snowman comes with him br br this movie has it all it has talking carrots that can stand up ice cubes that explode when you stick them in your mouth and killer snowballs yes killer snowballs they even say dada like babies i'll have to give the makers of this credit the snowballs are some of the cutest little things ever dreamed up i wish that i could get one as a pet frost finally freezes the island as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather patterns br br then there's the actors there's manners the fbi agent from the first movie except here he's wearing an eyepatch shiver me timbers i be an fbi agent and then there's the stereotypical british adventurer and the stereotypical black jamaican with dreadlocks and finally captain fun the man on the face of the planet bar none br br this movie isn't scary but is is hilarious i laughed my butt off the whole way through and i recommend this for anyone who likes a good bad movie br br out
<START> i just saw wing i do not really know why this movie was made what is the message of this story nevertheless i liked it there are some exciting scenes in it i appreciate a strong performance by martin sheen harvey keitel is less convincing
<START> a throwback to the old fashioned westerns of the 30s and 40s such as dodge city dallas has a number of things going for it gary cooper at his coolest blazing technicolor photography by ernest gone with the wind and a pulse pounding max steiner king kong gwtw dodge city et al score in addition there is a masquerade mistaken identity a faked death and more hair breath escapes than a republic serial as always cooper defines what it is to be a man under pressure forget the 50s angst western this is pure entertainment
<START> this miniseries is a reasonable sequel to the original gone with the wind if one views this on its own merit and not immediately following the original it comes out pretty good i am sure that most viewers will question the performances of scarlett and rhett but it seems unlikely that anyone else could have done better many of the characters here are new to this storyline so comparison in those cases mother uncle henry hamilton will is not a problem no one will every be vivien leigh or clark gable br br the best part of the whole production is the beautiful scenery of springtime charleston and ireland watch it for that alone obviously this was a high budget tv miniseries it follows the book for a while then has a totally new plot when scarlett goes to ireland br br the acting is credible if nothing special kind of the way i feel about roger moore following sean connery for james bond
<START> i was a sophomore in college when this movie came out and i had never actually seen it until last night i finally decided to watch it because i like good dancing and because the movie had such cultural impact after seeing the movie i am completely baffled by how it had any effect other than putting people to sleep br br the story is pretty preposterous when you think about it does anyone actually buy the idea that that beer joint full of gnarly old steel workers and teamsters could keep their clientÃ¨le with the high concept dances that those girls were doing they would have all been over to faster than you can say performance art can you imagine the reaction of the real life versions of that audience to that bizarre tv watching no theater dance thing that she did please br br it seems plausible to me that there could be a woman that worked in a steel yard and was also a dancer after all both are physically demanding jobs but i didn't buy for a second that that girl worked in a steel yard and i didn't buy for a second that i was looking at a real steel yard steel work is dangerous you don't keep your work area looking like a junk yard and not end up loosing a limb i love some of the inane shots like when two welders are sitting in the big corrugated tubes welding what the hell are they doing in there or when she is cutting six inches off of a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch she was obviously board and just started cutting random things up br br but story holes like that can be overlooked if the movie is fun or at least stimulating in some way flashdance doesn't offer anything to balance it however br br the dancing horrible it is the spastic twitch and pose style that ruined american musicals until well are we really over it yet the sensuality that the movie tries for is ruined by jennifer complete lack of personality i mean i am a 42 year old male and when she was supposed to be eating lobster my only reaction was to think that she should get a lobster bib br br you can't really get behind alex and her dreams because her character is so stupid and shallow the dog had more going on than she did br br the love affair is flat it comes across as nothing more than a boss with the hots for one of his workers zero passion br br even the final scene where she dances for orville and some other stiffs is unsatisfying because the panels reaction is so unbelievable what serious dancers wouldn't roll their eyes at alex's lame cheerleader routine in short the movie had nothing but leg warmers and large oh yeah there is a good chunk of nudity when alex rescues her friend from being a useless erotic dancer a laughable bit of hypocrisy other than that the movie is a waste of time i wish that the mst3k crew were still in business this would make good fodder for them
<START> it's not unusual that hollywood likes to pump out crappy films occasionally a handful of good films come out of them while the majority just sucks major ass it's also not surprising that those bad films are retreads of old tv series' occasionally a surprise pops up with the fugitive who saw that best picture oscar nom coming but for every fugitive there's a navy or some other wholly unoriginal film devoid of any plot or interest the mod squad in my opinion goes into my top ten of truly lousy films in which hollywood should get it's sorry ass beaten for producing what could've been a good movie we're shifted right dab smack in the middle of a story that just doesn't seem to make sense it wastes the talent and the dialogue is just bad we don't actually know who the hell these characters are and we could give a flying f k about what they are instead you're expected to automatically know who they are and what they're going to do there's one particularly bad riff about the i'm too old for this s t line that's just plain stupid something my friend verbally noted when we were clamoring for the movie to just end it's just an insult to hollywood cinema grade f
<START> i used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap if you look at promotional pictures posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime this proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap when i watch it i feel like i'm watching a police version of coronation street or something similar i have to say i still like the bill as i'm interested in police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that the bill used to have i want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over br br as for the script and characters they have both gone downhill most of the great characters are gone now although a few still remain i think and i'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren't its just that they lack the tough looks personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble br br overall being one of the only police programs on television these days the bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness if thats the right spelling and would now be classed as a terrible unreal television soap br br recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved 2 10
<START> this is probable one of the worst movies i have ever seen br br the only reason i gave it 2 stars out of 10 is the appearance of the gorgeous denier in some of the scenes despite her 42 years she is an amazing woman in every aspect her nude scene in the bathroom with armand assante is as hot as hell br br anyway about the movie well nothing really interesting to say a and a turkish gang fight over berlin in scenes that include people open firing on the street in daylight and inside a club where 30 40 people fire at each other with machine guns in a place no bigger than my house and amazingly after some hours of firing just three die and ten are injured lol br br while the gangs fight over berlin a serial killer is killing young children and then dumps them painted white on various places around town br br armand assante appears as the turkish detective who although now working for the police was an ex leader for the turkish gang and now is up to solve the serial killer crimes br br the movie is obviously a very bad rip off of the classic m movie the killing of the children the involvement of the underworld the character of the serial killer and the ending scene with the trial of the serial killer are more than influenced from this classic movie br br the acting is terrible the script just stupid the production of the lowest standards possible and in general this was a great waste of time and money br br don't even bother renting this one
