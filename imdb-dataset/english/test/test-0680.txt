<START> you know the story of sweeney todd now most likely thanks to tim burton's recent movie you probably don't know it though from this take on the old tale from andy milligan that notorious sleaze merchant that gave al adamson and ted v mikels a run for their money br br it had to happen eventually in my years of watching horror and exploitation from the 60's to the 80's i'm finally reviewing an andy milligan movie you see from 1964 to 1990 andy gave us many an exploitation and horror movie none of which was any good and barely watchable the bloodthirsty butchers is no exception br br there is dialog and well there is talk and that's one of the things you will find here lots and lots of talk the movie reaches almost manos the hands of fate levels at times as you wait tirelessly for something to happen while i love cheap looking gore effects the violence is too few and far between and in spite of it's reputation the breast scene isn't that shocking br br i love cheap and sleazy exploitation as much as the next trash cinema devotee but bloodthirsty butchers is the kind of bad that mst3k would tear apart mercilessly sadly milligan would die of aids in 1991 and if there is any movie of his i'd say i sort of like it would be the delirious the ghastly ones this is no ghastly ones though it's just bad
<START> there is only one reason this movie is watchable till schweiger he is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible uwe boll please take up another career the special effects and action are acceptable all other aspects were very disappointing all i can say is that kevin smith an evening with talked about tim burton not ever reading the batman comics and it showed uwe boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about if you two ever want to know how it is done go see doom was one of the best video games to film adaptations ever some people may disagree but if you watch the movie you can see that the guys at id had a lot to do with doom it doesn't seem like anyone at was even near this production
<START> this film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible and her sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing adolescent turmoils br br anywhere but here is an engaging film from beginning to the end both ann and adele are described well right at the start so we get to know how different their personalities are clashes inevitably ensue and they are engagingly presented i find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances it is as if i am living their lives feeling what they are feeling br br susan sarandon gives another excellent performance in anywhere but here she is charismatic happy go lucky hedonistic warm and loving all at once i have always liked susan sarandon and i think she is grossly underrated br br anywhere but here is a captivating emotional journey
<START> together with the even more underrated the sun shines bright wagon master was one of ford's favorite films it is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity well acted by members of ford's company' including jane darwell alan mowbray ward bond and harry carey jr like almost all of ford's films it is a meditation on freedom and community it is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of indians than in most of ford's movies ford for all his faults remains the supreme poet of american democracy
<START> i'm really amazed that this got an 88 on rotten tomatoes and a nomination for best foreign film at the oscars the 7 3 rating on imdb that's not so much of a surprise seeing the way imdb users have been voting recently i just can't get into a film in which the actual facts about its main character have clearly been distorted and not at all in a way to make the movie artistic but rather to make it melodramatic and less boring which it turns out actually makes it very boring for anyone who was expecting to see a serious and credible interpretation of the life of genghis khan the far fetched and over dramatized mongol often echoes the likes of 300 a film that couldn't be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate but unlike 300 mongol takes itself seriously it's stoic seriousness mixed with the obvious inaccuracies is what makes it truly the most boring film i've seen this year possibly the most action or biopic movie i've ever seen the characters were pathetically written honestly i doubt genghis khan was as boring and passive as shown in this film which is funny to me because if there's anything that i'd think should be changed for the sake of theatricality it's making a boring person into an interesting person the romance between khan and is similarly boring simple and stupid also without giving anything away mongol contains the single stupidest scene i have seen in a long time where there should be a good 20 minutes of plot development the film just skips forward without any explanation it looked like something out of a saturday night live skit that parodies epic action movies with horrible pacing did i mention how seriously mongol takes itself meanwhile it drags like no film i've ever seen before even now i could swear it was three hours long about 45 minutes into it i checked the time being pretty certain that it was almost finished besides some pretty scenery and quality acting from asano naturally mongol is honestly just a disaster it completely failed to entertain me or enlighten me in anyway i would never give this film a second chance and not to sound racist or patriotic or whatever but give me a trashy and mindless american epic over mongol any day at least then i know what i'm getting unlike with mongol where the reviews and ratings led me to believe it was actually something worth seeing br br the saddest thing about how much i hated mongol is that i have friends who i know without a doubt would simply love it
<START> nothing to spoil here at all but this could be a spoiler so beware br br special effects were on the level of a video game about five years ago or perhaps of the original star trek the acting was just pathetic some cheesy looking blonde across the desert while a voice in the background droned on and on and on this was the trek and drone half that i actually made it through progress is interrupted by a few fights ships blow each other up for no real reason that is apparent again it's not that there is a real fight that you would expect from a movie more like a cheap video game boi ing boi ing ship explodes next ship apparently some of the ships are looking for the blonde here in the far future ships must be and because many of them pass directly overhead of the stylishly dressed futuristic babe in black but never see her br br then there are a couple of choreographed fights that look like something put on by high school kids again the crude video game mentality is prominent the combatants shift to fight mode by flipping something on their wrists and a loud computerized voice echoes and flashes fight mode that must be a dandy design if you are trying to sneak up on somebody then you go to a big power station which looks just like a current day power line tower and plug in to charge back up lol i'm not kidding you can't make this stuff up it's like watching a freaking video game from about 2000 only the acting is better in the game br br more trekking then she shows up at the city lame sound trek gets even lamer here she gets into a fight with a mech robot of the future who cannot hit her with his big gun even though she runs right in front of him about five feet in front of him obviously robots of the far future are about as useful as toaster ovens in a fight she throws sand in its eyes and beats it to death by throwing rocks at it rofl i was at about 95 of tolerance by that point my nausea circuits flashing red br br in the next scene she ends up strapped to a rocket with some rope i kid you not tied right to the outside of a rocket this is supposed to be an advanced form of transportation at that point i bailed br br this movie is an utter disgrace for a movie made at the present time just a freaking disgrace there was a drippy story but the movie distracted from it somebody droning on about mother constantly br br i gave it a two because there were a few scenes which displayed some pretty nice artwork of a science fiction nature as background unfortunately the plot acting action cinematography and narrative distracted from this artwork and degraded it no kidding
<START> i watched about the first 30 40 minutes of this movie on television the other night and can agree that this is by far the worst of the series not any of it is funny even randy quaid can't save this mess eric idle wasn't funny in n l euro vacation and he's even worse here the only funny scene is where they're at the airport and some guy dressed as santa walks by the camera yelling did anybody lose this as he holds up a prosthetic leg br br 1 2 a star out of
<START> made and released at the time when the internet was just becoming huge this is a storyline hitchcock would have loved br br sadly hitchcock wasn't around to make it and we're left with an occasionally suspenseful but mostly silly thriller that is held barely together by bullock's intelligence br br it was released in 1995 but is already dated and the amount of mistakes and regarding computers must be seen to be believed and you don't even have to be a dot com person to spot them
<START> honestly this movie is weak very weak only capital character can something she's work like on bad engine so if you like red haired valkyries see that but better find picture of brigitte as sonja and put it on desktop it will save of disappointments well arnold also do his deal but it definitely not best his role other characters bad is not that word sword fights monsters ridiculous plot is really shame why was necessary rape she especially we don't see it br br anyway movie is weak though worse movies exist without main characters it would be just and if somebody even discusses it maybe
<START> based on the memoirs of gypsy rose lee who painted a much more affectionate picture of their mother than did her sister actress baby june havoc in her autobiography early havoc on which they shoot horses don't they was loosely based i saw merman in the original broadway production of gypsy and she was great as mama rose but certainly more merman than rose i was disappointed with rosalind russell's portrayal in the 1962 movie version an otherwise excellent actress russell was a very wooden substitute for merman bette midler by contrast was better and more believable than merman and i'd recommend her performance as the definitive one
<START> when commenting on this film one must realise that it is based on a true story and must therefore be reviewed for the quality and accuracy of it's portrayal of the events as well as its entertainment value it may well be implausible that jack shepherd should surrender twice to jack wild because wild had captured bess none the less it happened it must also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced which explains why he relied upon tried and tested techniques there were occasions when did not have the confidence to follow the script as written the film would be better if he had and yes i used to have a copy of the script stanley baker's copy one of five which i returned recently to my father rafe the writer
<START> seriously i donÂ´t really get why people here are bashing it i mean br br the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd the good news is the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of army of darkness br br especially in the second half of the film when the little killer snowballs attack i laughed my ass off for example the put one of the little creeps into a blender a la gremlins 1 and mix it after that it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice that was fun br br bottom line incredible movie rent it
<START> i just watched it last night and it was great i can see why some ppl have ill feelings towards it from a rugby fan and culture point of view but other than that i have no idea what's so negative about it the movie is great it has a lot of heart very inspiring and encouraging to all ages great family movie they did a pretty good job considering that it was a budget movie i love movies based on true stories events i was raised around rugby all my life it is a great game but i was never really taken to it because please forgive me if i offend anyone nothing personal this is just how i saw it i thought their trainings are not as ruthless or hard the players are not as disciplined and don't seemed as serious like other and it looked like it's all just muscle and blooming tackling each other etc but after watching forever strong i was like wow i was proud it did good things for rugby well it changed my view of rugby and also the new zealnd i actually cried i am not even new zealander and i was proud of their culture didn't even know what the chant meant until this movie the movie is not about rugby techniques or rugby it's not even about new zealand all blacks or the or etc mother of pearls hahaha br br so to all you beautiful negative ppl you are missing the point i am sure if they had the means it would have been better the is in there because that was part of highland rugby culture tradition or what ever you want to call it br br so any new members on this site such as myself please don't be put off by those negative comments see it for yourself must see movie there is a lot you can learn from this movie ppl of all ages it definitely makes you want to be a better person and be humble this movie reminded me of a lot of things that i already know and was raised with but i kinda lost along the way loved it happy reading and all the best br br
<START> i had my reservations about watching the return to lonesome dove after seeing and enjoying the original so much without tommy lee jones reprising his role as woodrow call or anjelica huston as clara i figured it just wouldn't seem authentic enough upon viewing i can honestly say it's a worthy successor the actors really make the show with jon voight rick schroder and oliver reed all preforming at their very best i admit the story might not be quite as engrossing as the first but definitely has it's share of excitement and captures the romance of the old west in a way that few other films have anyone who still has reservations can rest assured that the return to lonesome dove succeeds in capturing the 'feel' of the original and will not disappoint do yourself a favor and check it out ol' gus would be proud
<START> it really isn't hard to understand this movie i watched it with no expectations and no knowledge of the story from the games i was completely blown away br br initially i wondered how most of the characters have some sort of super powers but it is called final fantasy i also wondered about cloud's past but that was easy enough to look up in no way did these questions spoil the enjoyment of the movie though just the opposite it shows i kept thinking about the story long after seeing the movie br br it's one of the most beautiful movies my eyes have ever seen the music supports the movie completely the characters are incredible br br i want more
