<START> paz mexican poet writer and diplomat who received the nobel prize for literature in 1990 said about follows the great tradition of mad spaniards originated by his madness consists in taking seriously great ideas and trying to live accordingly a humble and spiritual priest francisco in a wonderful performance attempts to live by the principles of christianity but is cast out of his church for helping a local prostitute by giving her a shelter after she had committed a murder wanders the country roads of the turn of the 20th century mexico offering help to poor and begging for food his two followers a murderous prostitute and her sister beatriz who is a failed suicide desperately searching for love consider him saint but it does not prevent him from hatred and humiliation from both the church and the people he meets on the road he ends up beaten in prison and begins to question his faith for not be able to forgive his attacker br br bunuel tells the story in a manner of a christian parable masterfully and uniquely combining admiration and irony for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy the film is simple and profound as well as beautiful ironic and heartbreaking br br i consider bunuel one of the best filmmakers ever i've seen twenty of his films and they all belong to the different periods of his life but they have in common his magic touch the masterful combination of gritty realism and surrealism his curiosity his inquisitive mind his sense of humor and his dark and shining fantasies with great pleasure i am adding little seen and almost unknown but amazingly candid and touching surrealistic tragic comedy to the list of my favorite films
<START> a film first and foremost should be good storytelling it should be entertaining and entertaining doesn't necessarily mean laughs and it doesn't necessarily mean light it basically means you're not bored while watching it br br as brilliant as 2001 may be it is a difficult film to watch especially for the current video game playing ipod fumbling generation its slow pace and the sometimes intolerable amount of time it takes for an actor to perform a single action e g the attempt to rescue the crew member floating in space will stretch your patience on the other hand the cinematography is brilliant the film cleverly directed the ending thought provoking and the score the score is chilling especially as the crew in the transporter approaches the artifact on the moon boy i had goose bumps big time this doesn't happen often when i watch films and is a testament to kubrick's directing skills br br it is considered a classic and many people consider it the best science fiction film of all time that alone is a good reason to watch it if you haven't done so yet however just because everybody else thinks it's a brilliant film doesn't mean you have to force yourself to like it you either will like it or you won't perhaps the slow pace isn't such a bad thing after all directing your attention to something rather static and slow paced for 2 1 2 hours might teach you a lesson it will certainly be a different experience to all these fast moving fast paced images we are subjected to these days whether commercials music videos or video games br br i myself think it's a memorable film but not one i'm eager to watch again anytime soon unless i'm in a particular mood for slow paced films br br hence 7 stars out of 10 from me
<START> less than zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they actually stuck to the damn book but where they hadn't this movie presents does the job and leaves you with the creepiest feeling when its all over in ways not done until the late nineties with larry clark's movies 'kids' and ' br br societal outcast teens are faced with a rather curious dilemma they don't treat it much like one when their estranged friend daniel roebuck boasts to them that he killed a teenage girl near the river's edge in their suburban town keanu reeves may be the only civilized character among the bunch the only one willing to exhibit any sort of conscience anyway while the others either don't do anything about the girl's death or want to help their friend hide the body br br i don't know who is more sick in this film crispin glover who becomes nearly obsessed and quite paternal in trying to protect the friend and hide the crime by smuggling him out of the state dennis hopper an on edge drug dealer who clings to a female blowup doll that befriends the teens as a dealer of course and suddenly becomes involved in the events or josh miller who plays reeve's little brother tim he appears to be the most apathetic of them all at least until his emotional breakdown at the end it is definitely not peppy 80s teen fare obviously and certainly makes the point strikingly clear about the serious detachment these kids deal with despite a bizarre series of events thanks to many great performances all around even reeves proved some acting capability br br help yourself to a comedy to recover if it rocks you too hard
<START> renee zellweger is betty a kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse who is infatuated with a soap opera actor greg kinnear and who is married to del a cheating stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs unfortunately for him he gets brutally murdered instead while betty secretly watches it leaves her unhinged believing that kinnear is really the character he plays dr david and that she is his rn ex fiancÃ©e she heads for la to find her lost love not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk pursuing her are charlie and wesley morgan freeman and chris rock respectively the hit men who inadvertently killed del before they found out where the drugs were hidden they pursue her across the country while charlie gradually falls in love with his image of her br br and in la things get totally bizarre as no one realizes that betty is delusional alternately funny and touching this movie is almost perfect stop reading commentaries and go see it
<START> this is a nice little lifetime movie about a guy peter coyote who's living the perfect suburban middle class life when late one night the police suddenly bust into his home and arrest him for the murder of some guy 27 years ago br br in his prison cell coyote recounts to his wife the fateful events of 27 years ago and how he came into contact with wayne kennedy the man who he supposedly killed br br from here the story is told in flashback fashion and the more you learn about wayne and coyote and how they came to meet and what happened when they did the more interested you get br br the acting isn't anything to crow about although the guy who plays wayne kennedy is pretty creepy enough the real strong point of the movie is that mystery of what actually happened on the mountain the wife spends the movie running around digging up clues to the mystery and each time something new comes up we are treated with another flashback revealing more of the mystery it's actually pretty well br br so as far as lifetime tv movie's go this little flick comes highly recommended br br enjoy
<START> watching this hilariously retro but very entertaining career girl tale i was floored by joan crawford's first appearance all i could think initially was my god it's the same face as michael jackson in his notorious booking photo br br about 34 minutes into the movie diane baker and hope lange get out of a cab in greenwich village as they walk down the street you can see part of a sign in back of them for the stonewall bar scene of the epochal riots that are considered the trigger for the modern gay rights movement br br speaking of baker and taxis i had to laugh when she gets into one and tells the cabbie and sutton place please and be careful of the bumps can you imagine the reaction to that from a driver in today's manhattan she says that of course because she's pregnant and doesn't want to hurt the fetus but that doesn't stop her from jumping out of a moving car when she finds out bob evans wants her to have an abortion well they had to find a way for her to lose the baby 1959 and all br br sue carson is delightful as mary agnes why was this her only movie there is no biographical information on her in imdb
<START> i have been watching movies from i think last 10 years and i must say that i never felt that bad which i felt after watching this extra large bore movie it was bad very bad there were songs songs nobody should watch this movie the director has shown germans speaking english which is so rubbish germans does not speak english in one scene there was a white girl who asked himesh for autograph obv that he must have gave some money to her in the promo they have shown prepare for laughing riot but i could say there was only one scene where that himesh was laughing for no reason may be he thinks he's funny is very good she is like an angel but too young only 16 yrs old if you have plenty of time and don't know what to do then you should watch this movie or else its waste of money
<START> warning slight plot spoilers ahead br br the italian job is not the best movie you'll see all year or probably even this summer but it is a worthwhile two hours because it colors within the lines knowing its limits and not attempting to exceed them br br what carries the movie is the work of the cast in a movie about a crew of thieves the individuals must have a good rapport with each other without that cohesive feel the audience doesn't believe in the characters collectively or individually and the movie never has a chance but from the first scenes in which the men joke around and rag on each other while infiltrating a venetian palace the proper chemistry is in place br br the characters themselves aren't anything novel they're your basic gang of criminals containing about half a dozen players each with a specific and defining skill but each actor brings the proper goods to the table for his or her part mark wahlberg's understated acting and humor fits well with his part as the mastermind planner edward norton provides attitude and twirls his mustache well in his dark role donald sutherland is the father figure of the crew and he looks the part of the suave and old fashioned thief who is still mentally spry jason statham seth green and mos def don't do much beyond their character's abilities but they each nail those parts statham as the smooth operating driver green as the tech whiz geek with a chip on his shoulder and def as the demolitions man charlize theron slides in well in a part that doesn't ask too much of her she is primarily asked to to drive fast and look good that she does none of the characters are that deep or three dimensional but in this familiar sort of movie two dimensions are all that is required br br as the title implies the movie has a european feel to it a la the bourne identity in part because it was shot on location in venice along with philadelphia and los angeles also contributing to the euro flair is the rhythmic bouncy music which adds to the upbeat nature of the flick and complements the rapport of the cast the look of the movie is also a perfect match the bright colors of all locales enhance the mood and add to the attitude the minis not only provide a fun variation on the car chase but also work as a necessary plot device br br the plot is more or less straight forward there are a few surprises but they are more of the swift and smooth turn variety as opposed to the drop your jaw hairpin curve even with those the movie speeds along once the foundation is laid by the first act everything continuously progresses thankfully there are no breaks in the action for a romance something the movie wisely avoided there aren't even any breaks for 'real life ' the story has its purpose and runs that course without distractions the lack of character depth prevents the italian job from being more than a good popcorn movie but with all the complex details of the heist planning such would have dragged down the pace and quality of the flick br br there are a number of implausibilities that i thought of both during and after viewing but the movie is so enjoyable that i didn't and don't care in the real world most of the movie probably couldn't have gone off that cleanly but the italian job doesn't take place in the real world it occurs in a stylish and light hearted criminal world that appeals to the rebel in all of us br br the italian job is a movie in the true sense of the word it has no pretenses of oscar and contains no deep moral message it provides pure escapism entertainment and does so quite well br br bottom line maybe the best popcorn movie of the year so far 7 of 10
<START> possibly the worst film within the genre in existence it was announced as a comedy but is simply tragically pathetic i don't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to it is toilet humour at its very poorest i would avoid even watching the trailer i only went to see it because it was announced that if you like monty python you are bound to love this whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged i am still bewildered how one can honestly believe such a statement rarely do i leave the cinema really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me this one did it in just 30 minutes
<START> there are a lot of 'bad' films out there tune in to channel 5 every night of the week and you might just be treated to a daily shocking effort from one filmmaker or another there are possibly films that have caused me more pain were harder to sit through than this but in terms of writing acting direction cinematography and the bare basics of cinema is a truly truly appalling effort and should be avoided at all costs the only laugh it gave me was in the behind the scenes documentary on the dvd in which the film's geeky director darren fisher explains how it was his script that attracted the 'talent' to the project never underestimate the power of self delusion br br darren fisher britain's answer to edward d wood jr
<START> if you consider yourself a horror movie fan chances are you've seen hideo nakata's ring and dark water they're superb and ring's making its way smoothly into hollywood maybe dark water will be adapted soon too while ring is almost 100 pure heart pounding and nerve breaking a tale of two sister is both nerve breaking and mind twisting br br along with the other i consider this korean flick a brilliant and smart ending horror movie the only flaw this movie has is some consider its first 20 minutes rather slow it's actually typical with korean and japanese movies i consider it carefully planned rather than slow think of it as calm moment before the storm with thorough introduction of characters imho viewer will get involved more intimately with the character one of korean and japanese movies strongest point br br like ring a tale of two sister doesn't overdo ghastly appearance rather they let our mind do the intimidating job itself that way it's and horrifyingly classy at the same time i won't be surprised if hollywood remakes this movie after bringing ring and grudge ju on over this flick is not that good by the way i rate it 5 5 don't miss it
<START> so many of us who are devoted to the art of the motion picture will disregard or forget that movies are also business ventures most of the time they are far too costly to produce to be anything else in light of this it often seems a miracle to me that really great ones do get made every now and then once in a while the film makers will go so far over budget in producing a film that the businessmen responsible for funding the enterprise will be badly hurt financially and will of course become very angry about this i'd like to know precisely how it happens that this has often led to both the big studios and some major critics gunning for the picture when it is at last released terrible expectations are generated and often what people expect to see clouds their perception of what they are viewing br br you can see this phenomenon at work in the imperfect but magnificent '62 re make 0f mutiny on the bounty and you can definitely see it in the reaction to heaven's gate cimino took too long and cost united artists way too much money in making this picture the company was fatally wounded by his excesses and no doubt powerful people were out to see his reputation forever ruined when this strange mammoth epic was finally released there are always many film goers who dislike long weighty pictures the storytelling in this film is not accomplished with great economy or a brisk pace like stanley kubrick cimino often chooses not to spell out the particular statement he is making with a given scene rather he draws it out in such a way as to make the viewer feel like they are living in the moment providing time for his own imagination to participate deeply in what is being presented a lot of folks don't react all that favorably to this approach they want the story to move quickly and clearly and they easily become impatient and confused by this sort of film these factors doubtless contributed to the box office failure of heaven's gate br br by nature a film editor i am deeply frustrated by two problems with this film here and there a scene is clearly too long and could easily have been trimmed without harming its effectiveness then we come to the massive drawn out battle scenes at the end of the picture where these are concerned the clarity of the storytelling is indeed damaged if you liked the film up to the point where these occur your understanding of what is supposed to be happening is likely to become unclear and this is indeed a frustration not having seen all the rough footage i can not tell if actual re shoots would have been needed or whether some critical plot elements might have been made clearer by careful re editing of some moments given the time and money that were poured into this picture more care and thought should have been given to this problem br br there are other problems some occasional weak acting some dialog that doesn't ring true but these are really minor concerns the reason i am so troubled by the problems stated above is that like so many these days i too feel that in all heaven's gate is so splendid to behold and so magnificently deals with major historic political and sociological issues that it is just short of a masterpiece despite its shortcomings it is so dramatically and visually powerful that it stands head and shoulders above most other hollywood films i have ever seen i'd like to re mix a lot of the sound i'd like to re direct and re edit the scene where ella is killed but the greatness of this picture is such that these considerations really do become trivial when compared with the value of the total production i should add that it should always be seen on a giant wide screen to achieve the glorious effect that it is so capable of delivering
<START> meatballs is an ode to summer camp those of us who got to go to camp will see many of the scenes as we remember or wish they could have been br br bill murray plays senior boys counselor harrison who really runs the camp he reminds us of the funny cool staff member who everyone loves young campers gravitate toward him and if he speaks to you you feel like you are family this is one of murray's best roles he drives the film with his one liners and ad libs br br chris makepeace plays rudy the loner camper who is taken under wing and breaks out of his shell br br the rest of the campers and staff in the film were excellent as well br br the overall theme of the movie is the underdog overcoming obstacles to finally win from rudy to spaz to the camp and even to himself the underdogs of the film are the stars the movie has heart br br the film is fun and funny without being cruel or oversexed as some teen movies are today the cast look and act like real people br br the comedy and heart draw you in to the point that at the end just like at camp you are sad to leave br br in my summer camp experience we had underwear run up flag poles mystery meat trying to sneak a peek into the girls cabin the lunatic with the hook stories around the camp fire and moving sleeping people out of their cabins and putting them elsewhere but we also had a dedicated camp staff guiding us to be the best we could be br br my favorite scene is the overnight when they are canoeing across the lake singing a goofy song the one line that cracks me up every time is when is announcing light outs the evening before parent's day and he ends tomorrow is parents day and you must look rested or morty will be sent to the state penitentiary
<START> warning this review may contain spoilers br br the idea behind the character of danny jet li is a good one young boy is taken by hoodlum and raised to behave like a vicious pitbull controlled mainly by whether his collar is on or off his neck br br however the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the constraints of believability br br he has danny meeting a blind pianist sam morgan freeman who has to be the most trusting fool a man ever was along with his nit wit endlessly babbling rather unattractive step daughter victoria kerry condon i was stunned by the way when i learned victoria was supposed to be 18 she looked 25 or 30 to me br br amazingly there is no romance between danny and victoria br br when danny turns up again wounded what does sam do but take him straight home danny is out for 2 days but do these nit wits take him to a hospital nooooo i don't know if they even called in a doctor br br now danny is obviously not a mentally stable person this is apparent from the get go yet sam takes him into his home where both he and his step daughter could have been seriously harmed or even killed by this rather strange young man br br why morgan freeman took this insipid role in this asinine film i can't even begin to guess surely mr freeman is not that desperate for a paycheck br br then we have bob hoskins as bart the gangster who owns danny now you talk about a son of a gun that's hard to kill the car bart is in gets riddled with bullets that would have rivaled bonnie and demise we think he's dead but no br br then we have another car accident and yet again ol' bart escapes unscathed br br in addition to that we also have danny fighting half a dozen tough guys at a time plus a scene where danny has decided he doesn't want to fight any more i don't care how much a person doesn't want to fight when it is down to the wire of you fight or you die i think anyone would fight br br as i said in the subject heading this film is about 40 miles outside the boundary of reality as we have come to know it it's not just a case of suspending belief it's completely beyond that br br furthermore i never did understand why danny's mother who turns out to be a nice lady rather than the prostitute bart claimed she is became mixed up with bart and his gang and got shot maybe that was my fault i got distracted right about the time that scene came on but it seemed highly unlikely she and bart would have ever crossed paths br br 4 stars out of 10 and that's being generous
<START> i am a fan of good historical fiction and was thrilled at the thought that someone would take a well written book series and film it writing scripts is not like writing regular fiction but when you have a book you are adapting it would be nice to actually follow the plot line br br the portrayals of the the actual emperor and his 2 sons titus and was horrid they acted like a cookie cutter caligula and were the 'bad guys' in this adaptation there was a scene with titus dispensing justice as if he was caligula from the movie of the same name the way the are portrayed in the books mostly follow the reports of historians writing in that time period they were fair and sane not tainted by the imperial insanity br br helena the love interest of marcus falco gives as her reason for divorcing one of the traitors referenced in the title was that he was a traitor yet in the books it was because he ignored her and she felt that she would be better off marrying someone who valued her as a person br br marcus in the movie gets a slave named yet in the books he could barely afford his apartment let alone afford a slave there was certainly no romantic interlude between the nonexistent slave and a female gladiator br br on the whole if you want good cookie cutter roman stereotypes get caligula if you want good roman from the classical history viewpoint get i claudius
