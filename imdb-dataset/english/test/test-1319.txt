<START> there is not one character on this sitcom with any redeeming qualities they are all self centered obnoxious or two dimensional my husband watches it claiming that there is nothing else on but i would rather watch nothing br br the only sitcom that i can think of that was worse was yes dear at least that one didn't get 9 seasons br br being overweight does not make a comic genius and kevin james does not have the talent of john goodman jackie gleason or john belushi leah may have talent but if so she is wasted on the shrewish wife jerry stiller is convincing as an annoying old man maybe there is a reason for that br br this is a perfect example of why sitcoms are derided
<START> it was a movie that made ya think a little some parts a little cheesy some parts pretty good plot did at times and just when you thought sandra found a friend the friend was fraud or dead all i got to say is that dennis miller should have been in the whole movie his character was the best very refreshing after all the crap went through he would have lifted me and through the dumps
<START> watching this odd little adventure movie it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us such high quality giallo classics as the strange vice of mrs wardh and the case of the scorpion's tail but it has to be said that despite it's low quality production values island of the fish men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it's getting like many italian films from the seventies this is one is a rip off of a successful american film the one in question this time being the critically panned island of dr moreau sergio martino's film takes ideas such as mutation greed and adventure and moulds it into one slightly compelling film which makes up for what it's lacks in coherency and logic with a load of mostly intriguing ideas the central plot follows a boat which crashes on a small island it quickly becomes apparent that not everything about this place is normal and it soon transpires that half of the population has been turned into fish men a cross between a man and a fish which exist for purely selfish reasons br br the truth about this movie is that it's a lot more fun if you ignore the trashy production values the central monsters look completely ridiculous and much of the movie takes place on sets that look like they cost someone a few pennies but the movie is well shot in spite of this with the underwater photography being a particular highlight and the pacing of the movie is well done in that the film never becomes boring the way that the plot comes together isn't exactly genius but it takes in a lot of ideas and i've seen films made on plots with much less thought put into them than this one the biggest location standout in the film is definitely the lost city of atlantis to be honest i'm not a massive fan of adventure movies and therefore don't see this lost city get mentioned much but it is always nice to see it in a movie the central island location is good in that it provides an apt setting for the story and also provides the movie with the right amount of mystery as martino makes good use of the voodoo theme overall this isn't exactly a classic and there are certainly a lot worse trashy adventure movies out there than this one
<START> just before dawn is one of the best slasher films it very realistic and atmospheric it reminds me tobe hooper s the texas chainsaw massacre and deliverance deborah benson very good plays the heroine and director jeff created very creepy and dark movie just before dawn is beautiful photographed and soundtrack is very disturbing i never br br liked slasher films or gore except with this one very impressive and convincing movie at least for me
<START> i am not afraid of bad movies i like bad movies i enjoy mocking them in the company of my friends we're all quite good at it in fact that being said let me tell you how much i hated this movie br br to begin with it was incomprehensible rob lowe attacks some people they capture him but he escapes in this big ol' shoot out there's this singer whom we think died only she didn't unless maybe there are several of them who all act and look the same cue burt reynolds to come in and question the singer he looks like he's just wandered into this movie off of the walker texas ranger set and is darn confused then rob lowe dies only he doesn't and the worst thing is there's not enough dialogue or action that doesn't involve killing people or attempting to to even make fun of this movie and don't even get me started on the random chihuahua then there was the fact that it was supposed to be about the old power structure in eastern europe falling apart we didn't know where we were all the accents were apparently eastern european and what were burt reynolds and rob lowe doing there in the first place br br i desperately wanted to tell the people at blockbuster what i thought of this movie and to get my money back but since i'd gotten it as a special only 99 i decided against it what i want to know however is how the director got the greenlight to make this darn movie and what the 'stars' were thinking when they signed on
<START> if halloween 5 was a cruel joke to the fans of the series than halloween 6 is a like a vicious insult the storyline has gone to the dogs everyone michael is used as a helpless pawn in this film and he isn't at all scary he reminds me of an over weight alcoholic man than the boogeyman that struck fear in our hearts back in the original there are almost no redeemable qualities about this feature and i'm so glad h20 came out because it would be an insult to fans to have this be fresh on our minds br br halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that i liked having an adult tommy doyle in the film was a nice touch and it linked it to the original donald pleasance is here in his last performance what a bad film to end an otherwise nice career on when he's on screen he makes you remember the good old days when halloween was actually scary br br that's about it my friends the stalk sequences are unoriginal one of them being a blatant rip off of the laurie michael chase in the original the other characters are terribly under written and just aren't likable the music on of halloween's highlights even when the film is bad is tortured in this film we get a silly rock version of the stalk chase theme what were they thinking when they made this film br br spoiler br br their biggest mistake was off the character of jamie now played by another actress who isn't worth mentioning we watched this character escape death in two films we rooted for her and when she is killed in this film you cant help but feel sorry for her and realize that the filmmakers don't care when good characters are established in a film br br end spoiler br br the less said about thi embarrassment the better i wish it didn't exist i suggest skipping this film and even 5 and just going straight to h20 because if you watch this you may not want to see another halloween film again
<START> in 1976 a mother named norma lewis cameron diaz lives with her son walter and her husband arthur james marsden one night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key by the late afternoon a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents norma with an offer this man is arlington steward frank langella and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash if they don't press it nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else norma and arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal the incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties arthur who is currently working for nasa fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and norma who is a teacher learns that her faculty funding is being cut br br one's enjoyment for this bizarre sci fi thriller based on the short story button button by richard matheson will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise the opening of the film is particularly problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household richard kelly's previous film donnie darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes without the dream like state of that far superior film the box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world is entirely implausible that norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as two face from the dark knight and believe this offer seems equally contrived br br if this sounds unlikely so far what follows is even more absurd involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning the possibility of alien life or some other godly being influencing these situations scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the lewis family become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity to a point the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances in one scene norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot he taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes later at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that norma and arthur are attending this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow br br what is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration the ending which won't be spoilt here resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a greek tragedy while the resemblances can be seen by this point given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances there is little reason to care cameron diaz's southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly langella who is the most disappointing in the film with a very unsubtly written role as the mysterious scarred man who seems to be hiding a military base that would make dr evil proud it really is just a shadow of his towering performance in frost nixon there is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do in particular both norma and arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for kelly's pastiche of ideas underdeveloped and brief conversations such as where norma sympathises with arlington over their deformities and also when norma and arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them highlights this br br since 2001 richard kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of donnie darko though this film might be intriguing for a little while it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film's rather illogical revelations science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions but what kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic the box is one film this year that should have been shelved
<START> living in edinburgh and have a great thirst for history i was very put off by the taken wrong breed of dog for a start owner old jock was an old single man who came to edinburgh and died a pauper in lodgings not like in the film at all for anyone coming to edinburgh and hoping to see sights of the film you will not find the graveyard in princes st gardens there were a few moments were a tissues would have been great the actors were fantastic at padding out a rather flimsy script i don't feel the poor wee bobby actually got enough screen time possibly due to being lost at one point all that said the film was fine and any 8 yr old will enjoy
<START> i loved this film the audience i was part of loved this film and the little 7 year old girl who was with me loved this film we all laughed at the puns the visual humour and the good feeling you left the cinema with when it ended i could easily see why it was such a huge box office success in france i am planning on buying the dvd so i can see it again and laugh at all the bits i missed as i was laughing so hard the first time
<START> my son an avid skateboarder sat me down and made me watch this with him as i love documentaries it didn't take a whole lot of pressure on his part the whole amazing story of it all a bunch of dirt poor kids drift together and end up creating something revolutionary out of thin air well more out of some wood wheels and lack of waves to surf it just floored me it still does i didn't think i would enjoy it the way i did nor did i think i would tear up watching stacey peralta tear up over the fate of jay adams and just watching jay adams himself the sheer genius of the kid skating and the shrug of the adult remembering i watched it again last night for what has to be the 10th time and i still get goosebumps watching him fly down the hill with jimi hendrix's freedom playing in the background and i teared up again not too many movies have the same impact with me after several viewings brilliant
<START> director don siegel really impressed me with this film it is starkly shot graphic without being visually graphic well acted by all concerned and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a workmanlike almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer i didn't know what to expect sitting down to watch this a civil war movie or some kind of 70's soft core with eastwood descending on a school for girls in the south but really is is neither of those things but rather and examination exploration and descent into the soul of men and women a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized as one reviewer previously noted none none of the characters are likable by the film's end and yet each one is interesting complex and enigmatic eastwood plays cpl a union soldier found by young pamelyn ferdin you'll recognize that voice as soon as you hear it a girl at a school for manners headed by geraldine page amidst the chaos that was the civil war particularly in the south soon page teacher elizabeth hartman lovely young seductress carol and even ferdin amy have emotional sexual ties to eastwood each having their own needs and secrets and problems eastwood is not a nice man he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage in the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest the beguiled for me is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front this might be except for invasion of the body snatchers siegel's best film it certainly is one of eastwood's best real performances page is always so very good and hartman et al excellent the gothic set for the school is effectively claustrophobic some of the sexual laced scenes disturbing and what happens to eastwood is a leg up on much of the competition for creepy eerie demented film
<START> i have seen most of the tarzan episodes certainly the rated x with o'keeffe bo derek which is totally deplorable br br i have seen this version several times since it was originally shown br br all the cast had memorable parts great acting the ape sequences br br last night i viewed same on spanish station and other than some french dialog all in spanish br br as far as hudson not wanting andie's voice he did nothing until the very end he viewed the dailies and could have hired a dialog coach br br it seems silly that a story about apes and a man raised by them all speaking gibberish that hudson attacked andie the story line in the movie was that she was an american cousin the last time i checked carolina was in the usa br br she was beautiful in movie and her eyes and gorgeous hair alabaster skin mystified all us males she did not have to resort to bo's level br br she has remained a lady throughout the rest of her career and should look at this movie half her life ago as a starting point her performance sincerity made this movie enjoyable believable that a half wild man could ascertain her inner beauty br br great sending point for sir richardson he did steal the movie
<START> succeeds as at plunging you into a bizarre surreality where shapes haunt and curse a town it fails at being a competent horror movie while the film is sure to draw attention mainly to it's bizarre plot line and a few interesting visual treats it's going to come off better as a dark comedy than a horror film it's definitely a film you should see if your into the kind of stuff but if your looking for a scare or even a small chill you'll want to look elsewhere doesn't really have much else up it's sleeve but a great chain of odd events br br a
<START> so i won't disagree with the critics but i really was not all that moved by this movie i was a little hesitant to rent it as i am going through some of the same things the protagonist is supposed to be experiencing yet i did rent it thinking that i might experience some catharsis or at the least understand that i am not alone while i understood the protagonist's irritation with his careless cousin i didn't feel his internal struggle with isolation as much as i would have liked i felt that much more emphasis was placed on his disruptive cousin his welcome it is a beautifully filmed movie and i did really appreciate the use of silence to bring out the feeling of isolation
<START> i was about 14 years old as i saw the musical version of lost horizon i loved the film so much as well as the songs that i went several times to the cinema to see it again and again my mother bought the lp and i learnt the songs off by heart just as i did with the sound of music which people hardly know in austria i think the problem with some of these self appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager maybe he is an ingrid bergman fan but i was happy with liv ullman could ingrid bergman sing and dance what was so great about her perhaps the critic did n't appreciate it because he needed new glasses or contact lenses since he sees a close resemblance between liv ullman and bill clinton it was the idea and story behind the film the philosophy which was the most important and interesting factor and a musical in colour just made it more entertaining and enjoyable without damaging the intellectually appealing aspects it's a shame that many other films with so called great actors and actresses with unimportant themes stories are utterly boring in comparison
