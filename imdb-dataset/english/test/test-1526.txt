<START> this sequel proves that tim burton was for all intents and purposes the best choice to ever direct a batman movie the story focuses on taking on three enemies the penguin wonderfully played by danny devito catwoman the slinky michelle pfeiffer and max the superb christopher walken br br perhaps the best entry in the series it has it all complex themes complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out the cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand out is devito as the multi layered penguin here is a guy who is evil pitiable funny and perhaps most importantly scary the infamous scene with image consultants still sends shivers up my spine in other words the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances br br i do not hesitate to say that batman returns is my favorite of all the batmans released sorry dark knight fans if you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action then please check out this badly underrated film br br if nothing else it's at least the best film tim burton has ever made
<START> i found west point to be an agreeable film although i doubt that i would watch it again the performances were convincing with william haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his come uppance by film's end it's hard to believe that stardom beckoned joan crawford less than a year after this film was made as she looks rather awkward at times br br i would apply the comment made by another concerning ramon huddle 1932 to this film as well there is a great film waiting to be made here but there is something lacking the backdrop and integration of the corps was well utilized but i was less involved than i thought that i would be perhaps haines' character went too far or got away with too much his repentance did not seem genuine enough and what kind of message did it send for him to run every play in the last minutes of the army navy game where's the corps in that might as well have taken out the other ten men and let him do it all himself also i doubt very much that william weak puny character would ever have a real life counterpart at west point br br all this aside the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring it is a fine look into the daily practices of an honorable institution thank goodness that tradition still means something at west point too unlike the vapid traditions of ivy league schools only half heartedly engaged in these days br br as to the score it was appropriately martial but there was a distinct over use of snare drums using them for knocks on the door scene transitions et as well as in well over half the scenes got to be rather tedious it rather lessened the viewing experience i was ready to say i get the point already br br with that enjoy the film but don't expect too much emotional involvement
<START> this film was filled with great acting great musical sounds that blow your mind completely away larenz tate darius waist deep '06 was a sharp cat with the gals and he soon met his waterloo with long nina mosley big momma's house 2000 nina put her heart and soul into this role and when she meets up with darius the sparks fly at first and then there is a sort of hate relationship the entire cast of actors made this a very entertaining film with plenty of comedy drama and lots of loving and cheating going on this is a very down to earth film and at the same time shows how everyone eventually has his and her destiny in life and are placed in their little corner of this big world great film enjoy
<START> wow there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is i usually pride myself on being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad but this was just too much i would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device if you can get past the terrible plot and dialogue by watching it on mute the even more terrible camera work and shoddy special effects make this movie a real horror if your thinking about watching this because your a sandra bullock fan don't even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time and her acting is absolutely atrocious not to mention the rest of the cast which could be replaced with baboons who would do a better job at least then we wouldn't have to listen to the terrible dialogue
<START> film follows four friends from the 1950s when they're in high school up to 1981 they are craig wasson a yugoslavian immigrant georgia jodi a free spirit david michael who has no personality and tom jim metzler a big strong handsome rugged guy all three of them are in love with georgia but she only loves the film mostly focuses on those two it chronicles their lives love and attraction to each other over the years it also gets into trying to win the love of his tough immigrant father br br i love this film but it's not without its bad points high squeaky voice is annoying but you get used to it the story jumps around very quickly tom and david's lives are never explained tom shows up with a vietnamese wife and kids and david has a wife we never meet until the end some crucial scenes are badly written and there's some obvious pre release cutting probably to keep the film at 2 hours br br but everything else is so good you can easily forget the problems the story is compelling you really get to know and understand the characters and always get caught up in the lives with a few exceptions the script by steve is good in fact was a yugoslavian immigrant himself and based much of the script on his own experiences all the acting is great especially and wasson also reed birney throws in a strong likable performance as louie college roommate and lois smith is very interesting in her role and look quick for mercedes ruehl and glenne headly br br basically it's a real great story about immigrants coming of age love of america and covers the 50 80s perfectly br br this film was unjustly maligned on its release the studio didn't know how to advertise it it is a hard film to market and the critics stomped on it pauline review in the new yorker was particularly harsh it barely played in theaters i was lucky enough to catch it in 1981 in its short theatrical run and has simply disappeared that's a shame this is a movie that is just ripe for reissue i'm not betting on it but you never know a definite 10 all the way
<START> i rented this movie expecting it to suck and it didn't let me down i rented it with some friends as a joke but what we got was worse than anyone could ever imagine br br it starts off sucking before you even take it out of the box it looks like a blade rip off and the guy on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie its called vampire assassin but isn't an assassin someone who kills for hire well this guy kills the of his own volition so that doesn't make him an assassin br br then when you actually put the disk in it gets worst first off the menu animation is lame but when you actually start the movie every thing from the set design to the lighting or lack thereof is terrible you know a movie is bad when the credits even suck the acting is laughable the action is childish the writing is elementary and the directing is the worst
<START> i happened upon a rare copy of this early almodovar film with high expectations almodovar is a prolific contemporary director i enjoyed his 1988 film women on the verge of a nervous breakdown and i had read one or two very positive reviews of the film well i must have missed completely the humor that the reviewers saw in this film i just found it incoherent tasteless and boring yes there are plenty of innuendos people in drag and crude sexual situations and yes these elements may have shocked audiences in 1982 which was almost certainly almodovar's intention but much of the shock value has probably eroded over the years leaving a limp storyline beyond that the whole movie seemed very chaotic none of the characters were particularly sympathetic and for a comedy even a dark one i just didn't find this film funny i suppose it is possible there is a very select audience for a film like this but i'm just not part of that audience and not sure that i want to be
<START> this was a decent movie for the first half too many cheap boo moments but the tension builds the bad guys are creepy and everything seems to be setting itself up nicely the kids are not particularly deep but hey that works for teens br br then it just gets ridiculous and tries way too hard the why in the world would he they do that moments overwhelm anyone's capacity for suspension of disbelief the twist involves too many ridiculous coincidences and the title comes from a late attempt to philosophize some meaning into the film that goes nowhere and is quickly dropped there was laughter in the theater at moments that were in no way supposed to be funny br br great premise but just badly written and doesn't hold together some very nice shots but they're hard to enjoy while you're rolling your eyes
<START> yes it was an awful movie but there was a song near the beginning of the movie i think called i got a woody or something to that effect i would love to find a sound track of that if there is one available i saw this song on mst 3k and as awful as it was it had it's moments and that song was one of them br br if you like babes in bikinis this is the movie for you but if you don't then don't bother it was great material for mst 3k i have to admit though i would really love to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack though not just that song but a couple more were really funny and are classics as far as i'm concerned

<START> i've been a fan of heaven's gate since its first release i've seen it at least half a dozen times and have long thought of it as a masterpiece so it was with excitement and a sense of anticipation that i took myself off to see the restored director's cut br br to my surprise i was disappointed on seeing it again and have since revised my estimation of the film heaven's gate touches upon greatness in parts but overall lacks the thematic and narrative consistency and the passionate urgency characteristic of a truly great film br br firstly two technical problems the sound quality is throughout the film verging on at times some of this perhaps is intentional a way to mimic the chaos and confusion of history as it is unfolding but at key points one is unable to register what it is the characters are saying br br the cinematography is similarly the images lack sharpness and of detail the result is a certain graininess and lack of pictorial sharpness which succeeds in blurring foreground and background br br structurally the narrative is off key throughout as if cimino can't quite make up his mind as to the effect he is after he wanted an epic for sure but a pastoral or dramatic epic the film sits uneasily and unconvincingly between styles and perhaps even genres at times it reminded me of terrence malick's of heaven' or even 'elvira in its languid pace and elegant scene painting at other times it threatens to turn into a robust 'western' more akin to 'the wild bunch' in fact the latter film offers an instructive reference point for an assessment of as it shares the same period concern and employs a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a darker yet more heroic america br br this structural and thematic uncertainty isn't helped by the poor quality script which often sounds forced and jarring to the ear the result is an inauthentic sense of period speech br br the near greatness of heaven's gate resides in its set pieces the roller skating sequence in particular is astoundingly beautiful one of the most evocative scenes ever put to film br br another set piece which works very well in terms of unifying theme mood and setting occurs when kristofferson and huppert go riding in the new rig to the lake and she washes herself while he naps in the shade the languid pacing evocative music and monumental scenery combine in this scene to convincingly portray the love story which might just lie at the heart of the film and which could have been its saving grace if pursued more convincingly br br some critics have complained about the length of the film this in itself doesn't bother me a good film can't be long enough the restored minutes are critical in restoring the motivation and characterization absent from the cut version and they are full of pictorial interest br br perhaps the chief glory of heaven's gate lies in the achingly evocative soundtrack the repeated waltz motif and its different throughout full band guitar solo fiddle etc lends a haunting quality to the foreground action and establishes a thematic consistency lacking in the narrative itself br br despite its obvious flaws most notably the absence of a compelling narrative there is a sense of grandeur about the film one leaves the cinema with a rueful sense of missed greatness and a wish that cimino could revisit the film with the wisdom of time and hindsight to put right what is so badly amiss
<START> breathtaking at it's best intriguing at it's worst francis ford groundbreaking epic 'apocalypse now' is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century and in my opinion the greatest ever film depiction centered around america's involvement in vietnam br br what i like most about 'apocalypse now' is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre growing up as movie buff and with a particular interest in war films i've seen many films which have attempted to portray the and 'feelings' of vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so films such as hill' and 'we were soldiers' fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of vietnam by depicting which are more often than not tainted by the zeal of hollywood film production br br in 'apocalypse now' there are no battles no heroes or villains there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is intended to reflect the imagery of vietnam through the physical aspects of war rather it is a film which powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute 'horror' of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century br br the sheer brilliance of the acting in particular the interpretation of taciturn captain willard by martin sheen along with the spectacular cinematography filmed in the phillipines which provides crucial realism to the backdrop of the film makes 'apocalypse now' an unforgettable epic br br evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a maelstrom of mediation 'apocalypse now' is not for the light hearted moviegoer it is masterpiece that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated
<START> i'm glad i never watched this show when it came out br br i just wondered why it lasted 4 years it reminds me of the terrible 80's with fake people fake clothes and fake music how did i ever survive growing up in this era br br the acting in the majority of episodes i have watched are forced this makes for very boring shows the plot lines are not very interesting as the old twilight zone shows the old show inspired the imagination and made one look forward to the next show br br stick with the old twilight zone shows and spare yourself the pain of watching garbage
<START> ego seems it's the only reason this movie was made this movie is so wrong in so many ways that it's below one's dignity to write much about it every character was only good at self praise and lead actors i use this term liberally as has the director emote in the likeness of stone the little story if that fails on the basic aspects such as logic feeling and drama direction leaves much to be desired blatant flaws are all over the place character motives aren't defined prospective husbands are found overnight broken car windows mend themselves among other things br br let's face it himesh can't act neither it seems can in her defense she's still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of make up raj overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible darshan jariwala laughs a bit too much the actor who plays friend is the only natural br br a few questions do come to mind how can such a film cost rs 500 000 000 where did the money go granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and mallika was paid an obscene rs 15 000 000 for her 15 minute appearance and 2 songs but the sheer stupidity of the film boggles the mind including 3 mumbai auto rickshaws that show up and jump on a police car br br the good himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark let's give the devil his due himesh as usual gives good music br br the bad direction story singing is still hard to ignore br br the ugly dialogs and everything else br br final word painful in every sense of the word watch this movie only if you loved
