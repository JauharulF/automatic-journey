<START> i just finished reading forsyth's novel i thought it was one of the most in depth detailed and page turning books i ever read definitely in my top 10 i acquired a dvd version of the book starring mr swayze ok let me first point out that to fit a decent adaptation of the novel into 2 5 hours film time would of been impossible so i understand the teams reason to sway from the book version and differ however when i say differ what i really should say is take the characters from the book add a few leave a few out take away the book's plot add a modern new plot add frederick forsyth's name in there somewhere im not saying this was a bad picture far from it some of the effects were top notch and the acting wasn't half bad the story sucked and didn't rely on logic or reality forsyth's novel was so good and real and altered the facts of reality instead of exaggerating them this could of been so much more if it had taken its time and been made into say a 10 part series if you haven't read the book then expect a decent tv movie with a good acting cast if you have read the book then try and forget it when watching this
<START> for the record i hate spoof movies except for mel brooks and airplane because those are classics and make fun of the clichÃ©s not the actual movies itself i think that spoof movies are the bottom of the barrel for both comedy and film i especially hate things created by jason friedberg and aaron seltzer the geniuses behind date movie epic movie and meet the spartans br br i decided to give the comebacks a look since friedberg and seltzer had nothing to do with the production i was as objective as possible it was just like one of their movies it was basically every sports movie rolled into one with lame kindergarten jokes and disturbing images of bodily injury that's supposed to make me laugh and failed br br only someone high would laugh at these jokes toilet bowl who wrote this an 11 year old i was surprised to see that this was the creation of the producers of wedding crashers which was actually pretty decent but there attempt at the spoof genre was about as funny as a burning orphanage the only reason that i gave this two stars when it clearly deserved one was because friedberg seltzer had nothing to do with this
<START> apart from being a clever and well marketed variation on the nowadays hugely popular horror genre and a splendid formula to attract potential new fans in general i always somewhat considered supernatural as a massively giant homage towards the genre through the decades although not always noticeable to younger viewers and or people who only have an interest in more recent horror films each and every single episode contains a few obvious and subtler references towards classic and influential titles from that point of view it was only a matter of time before the writers would pay tribute to the vehicle without a driver' type of films and even more specifically the 70's milestones duel steven spielberg's acclaimed debut and the car being an avid fan of these two films i enjoyed route 666 a lot even in spite of its flaws and shortcomings the episode opens tense and atmospherically on a remote road where a black man is hunted down and eventually killed by a menacing monster truck with seemingly no driver behind the wheel the victim's daughter cassie happens to be dean's ex girlfriend and she calls the winchester brothers in for help the brothers can't prevent two more similar accidents before discovering the ghost truck sudden presence relates all the way back to a racial dispute of the 60's involving both of cassie's parents as well as several more prominent inhabitants of the little town some of my fellow reviewers around here tend to label route 666 as one of the weaker entries in season one mainly because the script is too preachy regarding racial issues and shows a different and more emotional side of dean's character he's usually the strong silent type whereas here he's confronted with unfinished romantic affairs from the past here to a certain level i agree with the racism debate but it didn't bother me that much really the writers eventually had to give an explanation to the presence of the ghost truck and racial conflict is an acceptable one as far as i'm concerned concerning dean's emotional vulnerability i can only state it's admirable to see how the writers continuously attempt to provide depth and detail to the main characters dean's behavior towards cassie sheds a whole new light on him in fact besides what really counts in this episode is the wondrously sinister truck and its virulent attacks it's an impressive and overpowering vehicle producing blinding lights and grisly engine noises in case you worshiped the brilliant aforementioned duel you will definitely find some amusement in the compelling chase sequences depicted in route 666
<START> master of italian horror dario argento is called a lot of bad things by non fans and is deserving of absolutely none of the backlash in fact every time i hear something bad about argento i think they're really talking about michele he just doesn't get the same amount of attention because his films were never as successful in theaters in fact his best film 1994's cemetery man was probably his least successful or just didn't get the attention he felt it deserved because after that he left film and went into directing television he's never gone back so people really don't know how inferior his other films are because by the time they've seen them they're already fans of the italian horror aesthetic which means you have to accept the fact that they make almost zero sense and are usually very unattractive films this is where the church stands out from the pack because visually it's so cheap and ancient looking you can smell the dust but it has its' charms too though they are few the camera work is truly arresting and the music score is hugely elaborate and grand br br since argento is the reasons people have seen soavi's work all i don't know anyone who caught the church before argento's suspiria and deep red is a bit of a hack sort of like an italian mick garris the utmost example of a director preferring style over substance the flaws of the church are constant and plenty the film opens with a somewhat interesting prologue showing knights on white horses charging through a peasant village akin to those you see in any robin hood adaptation in some long ago century these scenes are intense enough energetic and get quickly to the point then we cut to the present where the film's style takes over yeah the movie is okay to look at and for about 35 or so minutes in the present 1980's wherever italy the movie is just interesting enough to get us to the slowly revealing horror elements so now we know the purpose of the film is the build up of it's horror and it's a decent build up for the most part but as the movie approaches the halfway point we realize the movie's driving by and nothing is happening br br the plot is very simple i think two people working in a church one as a of books and the other as a of the building's wall artwork discover a scroll scripture that the man thinks will lead them to some kind of buried treasure or priceless artifact that he can sell and get rich off of so he follows his only to uncover a force underneath the church that has him while he's slowly becoming a demon who will make everyone else so while he is doing his demon work someone he passed the force onto kills himself in a manner that traps everyone in the church while the demon spreads onto everyone leaving a black preacher and the little girl who sneaks out of the church every night to go clubbing as the only 2 people who can stop the plague from spreading beyond the church walls that probably sounds action packed and soavi's style is far more lethargic than argento but never before have i seen an attempted surrealist film this agonizingly boring i kid you not absolutely nothing happens in the entire film i've seen expressionistic or impressionistic i'm no film school super grad films before but most of them actually show things happening john carpenter's halloween for one br br it follows pretty closely in the footsteps of lamberto bava's demons films since argento co produced we're shown to a location where a bunch of people gather one turns into a demon all the others are isolated that person infects everyone except a couple survivors then the demons either get out infecting the world or the survivors get out when the demons die this film puts all those same elements in place except unlike argento's work nothing happens okay a few things do happen but only one bizarre sequence has the panache of much more fun demons films a random woman's neck is impaled by a demon using a section of fence he rips out of the floor what's bizarre about that you wonder it happens in front of about two dozen people what do they do nothing she dies her head blood in closeup but all those people don't even notice though it happens in plain view and no less than 8 feet away from them maybe 4 people notice the demon running up to stab anyone he can as he runs toward her so they duck out of the way she's killed and in the shot after she dies everyone is just sitting around being quiet while a boy plays a saxophone i kid you not that's what happens that's more than logically incoherent it's plain stupid br br the scene is suggesting that the woman just sort of disappears and no one saw her death they all just up and forget about it and this 15 second thing is absolutely the only event that takes place in the movie i'm not saying it's the only violence gore or murder we see it's not it's just the only thing we can tell is happening for example in one scene a beautiful woman sees herself in a mirror looking old and ugly she starts clawing the skin on her face off but when she reappears minutes later no scratches people are devoured by fish and their faces are squashed by subway cars but later they turn up as totally unharmed members of a possessed cult in a scene that commits the ultimate horror heresy copying a famous scene from roman polanski's 1968 masterpiece rosemary's baby the greatest horror film ever made shot for shot even if argento did that i would be furious
<START> i am not a faulkner fan which is considered sacrilegious especially since i grew up near the author's hometown however i think this is an excellent movie on par with the quality of the movie to kill a mocking bird if you haven't seen it buy it anyway it's well worth having in your permanent collection tcm recently played the movie as a part of the race on film series i wish they'd play it more often very moving br br on a side note the folks from oxford mississippi will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square as it was back in the 1940's the courthouse city hall etc they're all on screen i never knew the movie was filmed there until i noticed the familiarity of the buildings when i saw the arch in the front of city hall i began to get suspicious look closely at the on chick's wall you'll see two for ole miss
<START> i understood before watching this film that it would be a low budget gore film but even by those low standards this film doesn't cut it br br the problem isn't so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had bad acting writing directing sound music and editing i expected all of that to be bad and it is br br the biggest problem with this film is that it didn't even do a good job on the guts and gore most of the 'action' takes place off screen and all we get to see are the after effects which look very fake even by the standards of low budget gore films br br there really is no excuse for the gore being so poorly done peter jackson made the equally low budget 'bad taste' at about the same time and he somehow was able to make much more convincing guts and gore than was shown in this film br br a failure on just about every level i can't recommend this film to anybody steer clear of it br br br br
<START> this is so bad i don't know where to begin br br the lead role is a good starting point it is a supreme mary sue character that has few things in common with the original one from the book who was a bit more credible no this one is invincible infallible indomitable and insipid even beyond the standards that this chicks with swords era that our medias are spinning out of late she is a twenty something top model thin as a match yet rich already a leader in her academic field a kung fu master a natural sniper and seems to have enough authority to naturally trump anyone official like puny fbi agents she is god br br to balance it out she is supposed to be socially awkward due to her typically harsh upbringing that transformed her into a spock which gives us some delighted moments where she wonders what is star wars or american idol but yet when it's really important she can conveniently reveal herself as a top negotiator and diplomat because she is so superior ya know to top it out she is played by a wooden actress br br the more talented boreanaz serves as a faire token for this construct acting as a bumbling comic relief and house watson in fact everything in there is a pop parody of better works like sherlock holmes csi and x files from which it tries to emulate the sexual tension between main protagonists it is however cheaper as this is delivered with all the subtlety of an elbow poke in the ribs but a million million poor factory girls will doubtlessly buy into it hence the crazy rating this turkey gets br br in fact the lowest common denominator goes a long way in this sad puppy resulting in titillating sex details from the legion of sidekicks that aim to pass it out as daring and trendy while the overall tone of the show carries an obvious neo conservative view on things br br story wise there's not much here to feast upon as crimes that always start out with some gruesome remains are resolved using non existent technology while the lovable but so wrong the women less than the guys goes on varied theories all of them futile as the main character has it all from the start and once it is established she goes out and then punch the guy typically a real tough hombre with a spin kick here and a slapper there the end
<START> if you take the films mad max beyond thunderdome and the movie steel dawn with patrick swayze you will have a pretty good idea what the film is about the only problems is that the film lacks the production values of either and represent mainly cheap copy of the former two true the film has plenty of action but asks the viewer to suspend belief no one can shoot a 50 caliber machine gun by holding it in his hand and miss everything to boot nor can you shoot at a group of people with an automatic weapon and miss the whole bunch there is also a problem with poor editing when the school bus flips over it is easy enough to see the cannon used to do the job and the lady driving the truck through it is superfluous since she had more than enough time to stop the truck if you are interested only in mindless action and violence then the movie is easy enough to watch but don't expect anything on paar with thunderdome or even the somewhat cheap and tacky steel dawn
<START> by many accounts stu ungar was not a very nice guy he spat on dealers stiffed people he owed money to and was verbally abusive br br many filmmakers might choose to the man making him into some sports hero that would triumph despite adversity but high roller doesn't do that and that's a tough row to hoe br br instead we have to look very closely to see a man that never matured passed the frightened little boy from the streets of new york despite all his successes and the only real approval he ever gets is from death himself very brave because people won't get it and very touching when you do br br what is also brave is the use of a scorsese feel aha how derivative people will say really but there's virtually no violence and loved gangster movies maybe the feel reflects the man stu and not the director marty and if it really is a low budget film and looks that good bravo br br finally the linear flashback structure wow will that get hammered yet not only does it work it works exceptionally well even for those who don't see the connection to the seventh seal proof in ss knight plays game of chess with death in hr says we can play a hand of cards for ya know death says never much good at cards damn great last line br br no tricky effects or camera moves no shaky camera nothing trendy at all just solid tight storytelling br br maybe that makes the movie too basic and somehow flawed but then again so was the guy and that makes it just about right br br 9 10
<START> blue planet wow where do i begin the years of hard work paid off in what is without question one of the best documentaries ever created br br the sights and sounds presented in blue planet like most documentaries with the attenborough stamp are rare and haven't even experienced by most people that alone should be enough reason to buy this series especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know' br br blue planet is not a perfect documentary however it does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode how many ways can different sea creatures swim kill poo mate and lay eggs and do all of these ways really need to be explored but if you have a deep interest in sea life this repetition shouldn't become a problem for you at all
<START> i'll put it straight to you this movie is dead boring it's about a flood that's it blah blah a little about family blah blah blah politics blah blah blah boring br br blame it all on the weatherman poor sod the deputy prime minister campbell is a hard ass that expects everyone to be clairvoyant a most irritating character br br if you are from the united kingdom or anywhere that it may flood then you might like this film it's sort of like earthquake movies are most appreciated where earthquakes happen br br this is not really an action film where the weather is the enemy and you must conquer or outrun it literally it is more like a time bomb that must be disabled br br looking at this movie it is understandable why the uk thinks the world is overpopulated it isn't but for them it is br br really the movie is about as exciting as picking and i can't recommend it it's over 100 minutes far far too long br br the problems with the film i won't get into them beyond this because the film doesn't deserve such dissection hint to you buy more boats if you bring children to this movie they'll either fall asleep or become uncontrolled bored screaming demons
<START> i doubt if the real story of the development of western union would ever have gained a real audience instead of talking about the building of the telegraph system out west it was the story of board rooms dominated by one of the most interesting and disliked of the great robber jay gould gould picked up the struggling company and turned it into a communication giant and part of his attempt at a national railway system to rival but this while interesting is not as exciting as the story of the laying of the telegraph lines themselves at least that is how audiences would see it jay gould died in 1892 had he lived into the modern era and invested in hollywood he probably would have agreed to that assessment too br br the film deals with how the laying of the telegraph system is endangered by indians spurred on by one jack slade barton slade a desperado is not happy with the development of a communication system that will certainly put a crimp in his abilities to evade the police in the territories he is confronted by the man in charge of the laying of the telegraph wires edward dean jagger associate richard blake robert young and a quasi lawman vance shaw randolph scott who is brother blake an with little understanding of the west is romancing sister sue virginia gilmore but finds it hard to get used to his new surroundings but he does become a close friend of shaw especially in trying to confront slade br br slade was a real western criminal by the way and the subject of a section of mark twain's roughing it he was hanged in the 1870s but he did not have any involvement in stirring up indians against railroads or telegraph companies however makes him a memorably evil and totally vicious type his killing of one of the major characters is done suddenly and from behind and he views the corpse as though he has just got rid of an annoyance but lang is responsible for that as well as other touches look at the sequence with chill wills where he is on a telegraph pole repairing it he spits tobacco juice several times while talking to young who gets a little splattered then there is an indian attack which we watch from the ground level at the conclusion young suddenly gets splattered again but it's not brown but red that covers him he looks up at the top and there is wills with an indian arrow through him br br it is an exciting film to watch and well worth catching
<START> there i was on vacation when my host suggested we take in this b movie festival in breda i was resistant as i hadn't gone on the trip to sit in a movie theater but i've got to admit that i don't regret a second of this one especially with stephen contribution it probably helped that i had no idea what to expect br br sea of dust starts out like a typical costume drama we've got a young medical student going to help a doctor whose town is being destroyed by a crazy plague which somehow involves exploding heads on the way he stops to visit his fiancÃ© and gets thrown off the property by her father traveling on he finds a girl lying on the road another plague victim and takes her along to the doctor's yawn i thought it all seemed pretty predicable br br and then everything went crazy and it suddenly turned into a completely different film tom savini shows up looking like dracula characters begin traveling to the other side of reality and the dialog gets increasingly humorous br br and just when i thought it had settled into a groove the picture changes again becoming really dark and bizarre i won't spoil it for first time viewers but there's an amazing sequence about hollow people lots of chat about the abuse of religion by society and some over the top gore effects and did i mention stephen this isn't a perfect movie in case you haven't figured that out from its appearance at a b movie festival but it's well worth the time for adventurous viewers great visuals cool soundtrack lots of interesting ideas the acting is a little zany at times but i think that's the point br br funny i had to go to breda to see find an american picture that looked like a british horror movie you figure that one out
<START> spoilers buried under a mountain of medical bills and his funeral business not being able to dig him out from under them undertaker vito lucia tony lo bianco came up with a plan to make a load of cash with the help of his two crooked pals moon bo richard lynch bill hickman br br vito getting close with his boyhood friend buddy manucci roy scheider as a mob informer to win over buddy's trust and have him tell vito what's coming down on the streets of new york in regard to mob activities buddy is a cop who works in a sub rosa unite of the nypd the seven ups that does things their way to clean up the streets of new york of criminals br br vito gets information from buddy and makes it look to buddy that he's really giving him tips about the mob and what it's up too and uses that information to tip off his hoodlum associates moon bo to rip the mobsters off of their weekly take as well as kidnap top mob loan sharks and hold them for ransom br br everything is going well for vito co until the mob decides to retaliate and mistakenly grabs beats and kidnaps a member of the seven ups ken kercheval who was working undercover thinking he was one of the hoods who was kidnapping and ripping them off later was accidentally killed by moon when he blasted out the trunk of the car that was locked in thinking that there was a suitcase full or cash ransom in it br br fast pace and exciting movie with that gritty and grimy photography of new york city that was so effective in the movie the french connection which also stars both roy scheider tony lo bianco who are in this movie too incredible car chase that started in downtown brooklyn and ended up in the wilds of new jersey some 15 to 20 miles away with buddy almost ending up decapitated for his heroic efforts br br roy scheider who is not a big man is as tough and effective as any big action actor i can think off like clint eastwood would have been in the same movie scheider reminds me a lot of he even looks a bit like him former and champion gene who beat the great sugar ray robinson for the championship back in 1957 and acts like him too in the movie tough durable and destructive br br tony lo bianco is very good as vito the undertaker the lowlife heel who plays off buddy and the mob to the point that leads to buddy's partner getting killed even though he's trash you can't in a way not help feeling sorry for vito since he only wants the money he gets from the ripped offed mobsters to pay his sick wife's rose's hospital and medical bills even the fact that was killed due to his actions vito never wanted anybody to get hurt but like they say when you play with fire you end up getting burned in the end vito have a lot of explaining to do to the not so sympathetic and caring mobsters br br the movie the seven ups has the late bill hickman doing the dangerous stunts with the car chases as well as act in the film hickman was also the stunt man in both great movies that had him doing the driving on the roads streets and highways of new york city and san francisco the french connection and bullitt
<START> although i'm not too much of a religious person i still had relatively high hopes for this movie as it does have the amazing steve carrell and its prequel bruce almighty was actually a creative and clever christian themed comedy however evan almighty comes nowhere near this originality and freshness that the original has and can't decide whether it's a comedy or a sentimental movie about faith and family values if it had chosen one clear path of which of these themes to focus on it could have lived up to its potential but instead the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor cheesy dialogue and motifs that attempt to give the movie profundity but instead practically insults the intelligence of the audience and also a very confused and clouded presentation of the movie's opaque message it was very obvious that evan almighty was very poorly written there are numerous plot holes and elements in the movie that make absolutely no sense for example although a large variety of exotic animals from all over the planet swarm to evan as he builds the ark for their salvation from the flood is their inclusion really necessary when the only flood that happens in the movie is downtown washington d c and a suburban neighborhood meaning they are at no risk of being wiped out the filmmakers it seems lacked the originality to modernize the bible story whatsoever and instead just had it take place in a present time without changing anything to the plot leaving many elements that just don't add up such as this and make it obvious of the idiotic motifs and writing within the movie overall this work is tragic in that the acting talent of steve carrell and wanda sykes isn't exhibited because of the bland characters they portray and that it was so poorly written that it skews and clouts many of the film's attempted themes and makes a mockery of the first film finally evan almighty also is an insult to the brilliant actors in it and any halfway intelligent moviegoer in that it fails both of them miserably
