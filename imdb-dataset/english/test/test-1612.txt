<START> not only the title the film itself is a long one too or so it seems that's because of the outdated style of acting and the pathetic way its hackneyed themes are bad marriages of the sisters and a homo brother who dares not speak the name of his sexual preference italy 2003 you don't believe it and you don't have to
<START> at the time of this writing january 25 2006 i am saddened to hear of the passing within the past few hours of chris penn other than footloose the wild life is the film that i remember chris most from br br i still remember in the film with slight fondness of chris' wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favourite restaurant with a huge plate of french fries in front of them drowned in an entire bottle of ketchup br br anyhow my comment is in regards to the title track sung by after these many years i still remember the rumour canadian spelling lol that was called in at the very very last moment to compose the track for the film and that they wrote the song on the plane bound to the recording studio to record the song and just after they recorded the song they went to shoot the low cost video for their title track i heard that this entire process from start to finish took 4 hours to do if this is true then they truly are worthy of being the most successful female band of all time br br anyhow this is just a rumour i had heard back in the day and still remember a generation later perhaps anyone who reads this can comment and clarify thanks
<START> r xmas peers into the lives of a middle class married with kid family of distributors during the christmas holiday season there's no story here just a disjointed collection of events ferrara seems to get off on the juxtaposition of the holidays and home life with narcotics in nyc jumping back and forth between each the players appear to be and now and then making for an unconvincing watch overall a poor effort not worth the time d

<START> what a stupid waste of money 30 000 square feet of rebuilt ancient rome 2 millions cubic meters of 50 feet tall buildings 10 000 costumes 2 years of works an international ancient history committee sic some first class actors and actresses the final result an empty tv movie for a single digit iq attendance
<START> buddy manucci roy scheider solid in a chance leading role heads a secret undercover police squad called the seven ups whose tactics don't necessarily follow the exact ways of the law they get the job done in their own way without anything being leaked to the press and this gives them a freedom to expand their means of getting to the criminals most working detectives and policeman just can not nab buddy has a pal from childhood named vito tony lo bianco who swaps information with him regarding mob types and shysters working the streets in nyc what buddy doesn't know is that vito is hatching a scheme using names from buddy's check list he has this book open taking down notes provided by vito but doesn't know that his friend has copied those very names written within his mind to set up mob families in a series of mob kidnappings eliciting cash thanks to two cop posers moon the always villainous richard lynch and bo bill hickman working with him when this scheme goes awry with one of the seven ups being killed vito becomes fearful because he knows how buddy can be when he's doggedly after someone especially when one of his own is murdered br br extremely underrated cop flick has thrilling car chase through new york city as buddy follows the kidnapping cop imposter's trying to get them after killing his partner the film isn't overly complex after the plot is set up and we realize who is the ring leader in the scheming of mobsters scheider has never been given the credit he deserves as a fine lead actor he has emotional range and we see how losing his cop and friend takes it's toll on him the film is briskly paced with good action sequences and sets up an interesting plot of betrayal between friends as greed comes before that childhood friendship and how what seems like a smooth crime spree against evil mob families can get cops killed
<START> i only voted it 2 10 mainly because hitchcock agreed to direct it he certainly had an off day with predictable plot lines stupid childish characters who are desperately trying to be funny there were twee sanitised emasculated sex scenes at a time when the hollywood production code was in full force lazy male characters in the film who like soap characters never do a stroke of work for which they are paid it always irritates me when food is usually never eaten by actors one exception was in the eating scene in tom jones 1963 although copious amounts of drink are consumed actors have to leave their mouths free for the next line carole lombard certainly fitted hitchcock's cool blond idealised image of a heroine but what ever possessed him to direct this worthless unfunny script he should have stuck to his thrillers it certainly has not worn well over the last 69 years i couldn't wait for it to end as it gradually irritated me no end
<START> i loved this movie yes it is rather cheap and i'm sure plenty of reviews will be snooty about that but my goodness what a lot they pack in for the cash involved i was reminded of the early work of sam raimi yes it is rough but has good energy and plenty of fun the acting ranges from the very good in scott ironside and shawn paul to the not so good in some of the lesser parts is it a cult movie well it grew on me first time i liked it but by the 3rd viewing i was loving it the movie is probably a 7 out of 10 but i'm giving it 8 for sheer cheek anyone who can pull this off for 8 grand is worth watching almost makes me want to visit scotland
<START> of all the adaptations of books by alistair maclean i feel that this qualifies as the worst but donÂ´t blame maclean it would appear that all that this film shares with the novel is the same title we have no suspense no sense of foreboding of mystery no chance to really empathize with the main characters we spend the entire duration or at least i did waiting for charlotte rampling to shed her clothing for charlotte this appears to take a remarkably long time still a glimpse of charlotte tits really canÂ´t save this disastrous film maclean has once again been kicked into the gutter to endure the sniping of those bitter hacks and nit pickers who would appear to blame him for all the ills that befall attempted filming of his books poor old alistair must have crawled into a corner and whimpered when this one came out at least bear island which also uses the maclean name but apparently none of his novel was a little exciting the excitement here is in waiting for the final credits
<START> as everyone knows nobody can play scarlett o'hara like vivien leigh and nobody can play rhett butler like clark gable all others pale in comparison and timothy dalton and joanne whalley are no exceptions one thing that i really couldn't get past was that joanne has brown eyes the green eyes were the most enhancing feature of scarlett's good looks and in this sequel she has been stripped of those br br the movie as well as the book had several lulls in it the new characters weren't all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever it could be that i'm only 11 but i saw no change in her attitude until the last say 10 minutes when rhett told her she had grown up if rhett hadn't told her that i would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude she really loved cat her baby she likes this child best because she had it with rhett her only loved husband still if you've read gone with the wind you would see that children make no difference in scarlett's world br br quite frankly it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without rhett all anybody cares about is whether or not rhett and scarlett get back together and scarlett took way too long to get to that it is virtually nothing compared to gone with the wind but then again what isn't if you have read the novel you will like that better than the movie br br i would watch it just because it is the sequel to gone with the wind regardless of whether or not it's worthwhile it may not satisfy you entirely but it will get you some of the way there
<START> while it's one of two movies on tales of voodoo volume 1 there's no voodoo or anything supernatural in it the box labels it hell hole but the screen title is escape from hell hole the title is confusingly similar to hell hole 1978 aka escape from women's hell hole a group of women bathe in a river and seemingly the worst thing they have to worry about is a peeping tom who they easily overpower no nudity in this or any other scene however br br a woman named drives up in a car and seems to be known and liked by all the women she invites to come and live in the city with her and her uncle m g once they get there it becomes clear that m g wants to take virginity m g runs some sort of house of prostitution and he's either in charge of a corrupt branch of the military or runs a paramilitary outfit or prefers for his guards to all wear military style uniforms br br the women who refuse him or otherwise make trouble get put into a prison gets sent there the women get tortured and sometimes possibly raped by the guards br br various unsuccessful attempts at escape or rescue are made but inevitably fail despite the obvious advantages the women have they outnumber the guards vastly and relatively few of the guards have automatic weapons most have semi automatic rifles or handguns br br wip genre enthusiasts may like it and the fact that it was made in the philippines gives it some novelty but otherwise eh
<START> some have commented on the subtitles not being a problem in this film i beg to differ the in the facial expressions and subtle interactions between the characters is such that you can not afford to take your eyes away for even a fraction of a second i tried to watch on the dvd in english to overcome this problem don't make this mistake the result is a travesty the only way to get the full benefit is to watch it two or three times in quick succession so you know it and then ignore the subtitles an acting master class not in the dialogue but body language br br it is the little things the postmaster shop keeper puffs out his chest and goes in to get his cap before delivering a letter from france the general's bemused expression as his delight in a bunch of perfect grapes elicits a biblical reference with a profundity worthy of 'being there' br br the cinematography is awesome and the bleak minimalist village with its washed out colour just accentuates the sumptuousness of the feast when it comes i have a friend who claims to be descended from the and who's family motto is 'if it is worth doing it is worth doing to amen br br i laugh out loud and cry each time i watch this film
<START> once in a while i like a good horror movie so i thought this would be a splatter and gore movie but it was a boring boring movie maybe because i have seen a cut version because there where only two things that where a little splatter one time where some ones cuts someone arm of and where some one shots an arm of but that where the only things for example had more cool then evil ed its more a boring ed than a evil ed and some actors where lousy to o
<START> welcome to the plan 9 from outer space of star trek movies come on trekkers admit it this movie is so bad so staggeringly inept in every department it's become something of a classic br br the shat gives the worst performance ever committed to celluloid hi bones brilliant this isn't just ham it's several large pig farms in kentucky br br the special effects should be done under the trade descriptions act for using such a term the enterprise is a moving piece of cardboard in this film really even the star trek tv show had better br br bones spock and the shat sing yeah spock sings row row row your boat after struggling over the meaning of the words capt life is not a dream poor leonard nimoy he must really want to strangle shatner for this could the shat not have given us his rendition of mr tambourine man or with nimoy on ballad of bilbo baggins sorely disappointed br br a sean connery look a like plays spock's half brother only cos they couldn't get sean connery uhura does a fan dance that would have been sexy in 1966 in 1989 it's like watching your drunk granny embarrass herself at a christmas party br br cat woman jumps on shatner's back shat twirls her around a few times like a wwf wrestler and chucks her off the shat seems connery 2 0 was a bit of a vulcan rebel which explains why spock hasn't previously mentioned him in 79 t v episodes and 4 movies mccoy apparently mercy killed his dad but afterwards they found a cure tell me this isn't hysterically funny br br the 11 deck enterprise suddenly grows another 400 decks for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft spock's boots amazingly support bones and the shat as well should also have used em on the humped back whales in star trek iv shatner meets god or what purports to be god but i assume is really some kind of alien being god looks a bit like charlton heston in the 10 commandments sean connery the 2nd calls on god to share his pain and promptly dies or something god punishes the shat for questioning his identity so spock kills god with a photon torpedo i'd love to know what jehovah's witnesses made of this scene br br the shat having killed god promptly goes back to his sing song with spock and bones altogether now row row row your boat
