<START> i love most jet li movies with the exception of romeo must die and i bought this movie in a very cheap three pack with the master and twin warriors while twin warriors was very impressive and i was thoroughly intrigued by it and the master was a bit karate kid but also enjoyable i thought this movie was terrible i'm not just saying that because i'm used to better movies i'm saying that it was almost down there with kazaam the fight scenes were terrible blurry cameras and no real fighting and the plot was your typical stupid kung fu plot if you are going to have a plot this stupid see 'man turns into woman to become all powerful then falls in love with jet you best have some great fighting to go with it if you are looking for an original hk jet li movie i suggest you go rent shaolin temple 2 aka kids from shaolin
<START> i'm not sure how the imdb weighted average came up with such a low rating on this film it is in my opinion and by all other accounts an overlooked gem of a movie rip torn is fantastic as the stubborn noel lord and cardinal superlative as his torn and cardinal are both underrated actors who are finally given a stage to work their craft on br br their relationship isn't always pleasant but it's very real this is not the humerous and touching love story it's billed as on the dvd jacket in the end it is a tragedy lord simply aims too high and ignores all the advice to take the money offered by the power company to move br br the music is fantastic as are the period sets
<START> for some reason some shows just fail some deservedly some not buddy was a clever show with interesting characters and dark humor that was enjoyable to watch maybe it was never intended to be a big hit but it had a quirkiness about it that made it enjoyable that being said it appears i may have been the only one watching dennis farina and frank whaley were casted perfectly in their respective roles production quality and writing were great and vegas was the perfect backdrop hopefully the first and only season will be released on dvd as i believe it deserves some notoriety maybe at least make it on tv land cheers
<START> well it might be a kid's movie perhaps but i'm not gonna let my kids from 9 watch it so the one who say it is a kid movie hmm it is teenager movie i agree so but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very good so good that at the end nobody nows truth or lie anyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story i think they writers mend a lesson whit it ''the truth is never
<START> why do i give this 1974 porn movie 7 points because i watched it and i found it hilarious aliens their weird spaceship their weird helmets my god was that a sight and all what these desperate alien women need is semen from the earth br br and where do they look for it in upper germany and that is where the main fun comes from in europe and more so in german speaking countries is seen as a traditional and backward region and then the actors are so helpless with the alien women well there have been films about people being unable to deal with women like the american pie series br br but what this film achieved is a true funny weirdness you constantly wonder how they came up with these crackpot ideas but it was 1974 and looking back 35 years fills one with a kind of nostalgia you've never seen a film like that br br and if you don't mind seeing the casual pubic hairs and breasts watch it once it is a comedy essentially not a porn flick
<START> this was so much better than i expected the film oozed compared to other b moive of this sort of budget the script was good if a little formulaic but the acting was surprisingly good from all including lorenzo and you always expect good standards from scheider and busey aswell as the good plot and acting the action is good especially the car chases and the crashes are a class all in all this is a rise above other b movie thrillers and doesn't have to rely on constant nudity or a flow of cheesy puns to make up for budget and script its certainly worth a rent
<START> one of the worst films of it's genre br br the only bright spots were lee showing some of the sparkle she would later bring to the time tunnel and batman br br a young patty duke also outshone the more established actors br br
<START> i remember running home from school almost every day to catch channel 5 monster movies but never did i run home faster then when this movie was scheduled somehow the idea of being a boy and having a giant robot as a friend appealed to me in a very unique way sure i pretended to be spiderman batman and other superheros but i really wanted to be johnny over any of them br br i have not seen this movie in 30 years and i can still remember it vividly who can forget the way giant robot shot missiles out of his fingers or how about the way threw his fingernails to make explosions geez i can even still whistle the theme music that plays at the end which is so tragic that i remember crying myself to sleep a number of times br br only one other movie has the kind of magic that this movie does in my mind and that is the wizard of oz but i have seen that movie many times since i was a kid of course the wizard of oz is a true classic whereas voyage into space is low budget nonsense these two films shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence but to a young boy it isn't high production values or continuity that capture your heart its flying monkeys and giant robots br br p s my cousin use to do a very accurate impression of giant robot he pronounced it giant if you recall giant robot had a particular way of shooting his missiles and my cousin had it down cold i made him repeat the routine endlessly for my personal amusement
<START> i rented this movie because elijah wood has done some good work and i thought this might be an overlooked treasure it was not a treasure i don't know if this was straight to video but it should have been straight to the dump br br elijah wood fans will like the fact that he appears shirtless in a much too brief shower scene but no sane person would like this script imagine memento played by teen actors but ten times more confusing and a hundred times less plausible case in point janeane garofalo plays a caring psychologist apparently keeping the chain of mediocrity alive' br br as if false memories and mind over matter medicine weren't hokey enough the movie also hinges on one of those unexplained psychic twin bonds that keep the plot moving and the audience baffled this same twin bond creates a few too many contrived love scenes between wood's character and the girl from she's all that who plays the saintly sister of wood's angry cancer victim friend br br adding to the of this screenplay wood's other friends are a mentally challenged cancer victim and kidney a young black boy afflicted with a mysterious kidney disease kidney's dying wish comes true when dr garofalo gives him his own walkman this character's hackneyed function in the story is matched by his on again off again relationship to walking usually bound to a wheelchair kidney has several inexplicable scenes showing him pushing others around in it br br characterization may be one small detail but it is indicative of this film's many other flaws the bumblebee flies anyway is definitely bumbling but it never flies
<START> i saw this movie over 20 years ago and had rather fond memories of it catching again on cinemax this month i realized how little discernment i had about films back then this is an utterly ordinary spaghetti western with absolutely nothing noteworthy about it script direction acting photography are all a big blah stick with the sergio leone westerns
<START> 1st watched 8 7 2004 3 out of 10 dir brett thompson silly juvenile focused movie about three kids being zapped into their favorite cartoon with their parents experiment the script left much to be desired in this hanna barbara like rip off of some saturday morning 'live action with people in dinosaur costumes kids show' with some goofy cavemen hanging around nothing really to admire about this and nothing much to be said either i'm just amazed i found this at a blockbuster video store as bad as it was and the way the stores are ridding themselves of old vhs movies i guess they couldn't even sell it so back on the rental rack it went
<START> honestly buying this movie was a waste of money it's one of the most boring movies i have seen in my life the only part i liked is the ending but it's so slow that not even the fantastic ending can save this movie
<START> yeah sure the movie its visuals already did looked horrible and not very promising but the premise and the cast looked good so i still sort of expected to be entertained by this movie this however unfortunately wasn't the case the premise is good but the story is filled with improbabilities and is logically flawed br br this movie is potential flushed down the toilet the main plot is interesting and somewhat original it's good enough to make a good adventurous movie out of would you think this movie however fails to entertain and i think that that is this movie biggest flaw perhaps it takes itself too serious and a little bit more humor certainly wouldn't had done the movie any harm instead it now is nothing more than a lame and cheap looking movie filled with the one unlikely event after the other that also steals a bit too much from other more successful movies jurassic park obviously br br the characters also don't help to make the movie any more compelling or at least interesting to watch i still think that edward burns did a fairly decent job as the main lead the rest of the characters however really get muddled in into the movie and they get very little interesting to do the movie rather relies on its visual which are extremely poor catherine mccormack also plays a very irritating character basically all her character does is complain and talk about how right she was and the rest oh so wrong her character just isn't a likable one and the rest of the characters well i already have forgotten their names i think that that is saying enough about them it certainly is true though that ben kingsley's performance alone makes this movie worth watching he is really excellent in his sort of villainous businessman role but from the moment when he disappears out of the movie the movie really goes downhill rapidly br br visually the movie is extremely poor it has some dreadful looking cgi effects and they couldn't even get the more simple 'blue screen' effects look convincing in the movie the sets are also awful and cheap looking like they can fall over and break down every moment br br the movie never gets tense exciting or adventurous since the story is brought in the least interesting and engaging way possible it's a very distant movie with distant characters that fails to impress there are plenty of action sequences but all of them are so ridicules looking and far from believable that they never get tense or good enough br br so basically this movie is lacking in everything that is needed to make a genre movie like this one a good and successful one it's sad to see how low director peter has sunk to the last couple of years after making some good movies in the '70's and '80's br br 4 10
<START> oh my gosh i love this movie much it is so incredible i loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult it is my favorite disney movie of time you should watch it watch it and love it my friends and i watch it a ton it is good i recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart my favorite part is the song and dance number with all of the strays and thomas the writers producers director completely nailed this one yeah nailed it to the wall br br
<START> based on the excellent novel watchers by dean koontz is this extremely awful motion picture that probably shouldn't be viewed by anyone not since the running man have i seen a book butchered so far beyond recognition the difference however is that the running man film was still enjoyable as an amusing action film laden down a million catch phrases this filmÂ nope nothing remotely amusing in fact if you love the book as i do you'll hate this bastardization even more br br warning contains spoilers i'm basically going to tell you the story here almost in it's entirety why because you dear reader do not also need to suffer through this okay for me because i enjoy watching crap because i like complaining about sh tty things now on to the nasty this film revolves around a boy and his mother running away from the government and a mutant monkey creature soldier which escaped from a destroyed government genetics lab with a super smart golden retriever which the hero calls trust me in the novel this story rocked i'll get to that later anyway the hero is none other that dreamy boy child corey haim oh i'm not kidding our hero runs around voice and all trying to convince his mom to help save this dog from the evil government which him and made him genetically ultra smart the monkey creature referred to as an god help us is also a genetic stew of a creature built to be the ultimate fighter on battlefields of the future michael ironside total recall starship plays a badass is also in this film and no i couldn't figure out how anyone convinced him this would be a good idea he plays a government agent with the hunting the dog and creature oh yeah here's some he's also a creation from the government and the same lab and lo and behold spends most of the movie being a prick and killing all that killing is supposed to be done by the monkey soldier instead of a rockin' kick ass creepy horror film we have a rectal hemorrhage of a teenybopper horror flick the dog's intelligence is discovered all too conveniently and believed easier than we believe we can see clouds by looking outside breakdown br br change from book to film br br lead character travis turned from man to boy child br br man's love interest in book nora is now his all her depth and character growth is completely gone br br johnson black man is now white mr ironside this matters as the character's strength was built on his heritage in the book br br relationship between two authority figures completely ignored now kills the guy who was originally his best friend br br one principle character in the book is now totally absent the immortal that hunted the heroes maybe this is supposed to be ironside but then why is he someone else br br dog never receives deserving name of einstein in the movie br br no part of the book took place in a high least nothing that had strong bearing on the plot br br takes place over a matter of days rather months like the pacing br br corey haim's girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters in the book and they never met in the book br br character of johnson is no longer cool headed instead he's a total asshole that bullies his way through people br br hero travis was part of delta force military segment specializing in hunting terrorists instead his dad who is never seen in the film was part of that group br br perceived intelligence in the monster now totally absent br br subplots involving soviets and the mob completely gutted out of the story br br these are just the most obnoxious changes and the one's i could remember off hand and a day later br br the good br br eventually after 90 odd minutes of pain and mental anguish the movie ended br br didn't hurt it didn't help it br br michael i like him br br the dog is still fairly likable br br wacky totally 80's title screen br br the bad br br okay the writing for one is extremely awful br br the direction is so half assed that anyone watching the film will feel superior to everyone involved in it br br the acting is crappy and weak especially from corey haim br br loose weak watered down story br br the monster looks just pathetic that is when we are actually allowed to see the bloody thing its head is gigantically over sized the yellow eyes that were so much a part of the thing in the book are seen for no more than two seconds instead of a lean powerful fast intelligent killing machine we have some jackass in a puke ugly monkey suit forced upon us br br absolutely no character development br br even the violence and gore are done poorly for f ck sakes this is supposed to be a horror film usually violence is at least done well br br the ugly br br the idea that dean koontz whored out his brilliant novel to become this filthy f cking piece of sh t brings me dangerously close to vomiting all over myself and anyone near me there are movies worse than this headache inducing as that idea may seem but so far only alien vs predator at least to me is a bigger travesty and more painful disappointment br br memorable scene watching the end credits start br br acting 3 10 story 4 10 the novel was really good this is just terrible atmosphere 5 10 cinematography 4 10 character development 1 10 special effects make up 4 10 nudity sexuality 0 10 violence gore 4 10 music 5 10 direction 3 10 br br cheesiness 7 10 crappiness 9 10 br br overall 3 10 br br i would recommend that no one watch this movie ever except for a few extreme die hard horror only if you haven't read the novel instead i would recommend that anyone interested in this avoid it entirely and buy check borrow the book br br www residenthazard com
