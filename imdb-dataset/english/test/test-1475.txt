<START> perhaps the worst of the nemesis films and that says a lot this mess features so many flashbacks to part 2 that you might as well say that you've seen them both even if you've only endured this entry making matters worse are two wisecracking cyborgs who have absolutely no entertainment value in other words they are a perfect fit for this endlessly boring cinematic mistake
<START> most of the comments on this movie are positive so i thought i would try and redress the balance i came out of this movie wondering what was going on i now know and still consider it to be a poor movie i discounted a dream sequence as that seemed too obvious i was glad that i had a free ticket to the movie or i would have asked for my money back movie reviewers and critics love this movie which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film the 8 rating this movie has is so misleading in 20 years time this film will not compare to true greats such as the godfather the film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isn't enough to save the film nor are the lesbian scenes
<START> stephen sondheim's sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street opened on broadway on 1 march 1979 with len and angela lansbury in the leading roles although it swept virtually every award imaginable the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended its run at performances fortunately however the play then went on tour and along the way was captured on film the result is a remarkable capture of the play featuring george who replaced and lansbury in a close approximation of the original broadway staging br br there is however a flaw simply stated stage plays do not film very well for a performance that works well on the stage must fill the theatre and is therefore very very large and when placed on film such performances often seem slightly static oppressively aggressive or both sweeney todd is no exception seen on film it has a stand and sing quality and while both and lansbury seem to have modulated their performances for the sake of the camera such is not the case with betsy joslyn as joanna her larger than life performance reads on film as unpleasantly frantic and her extremely operatic voice feels out of place when contrasted with the voices of the overall cast br br taking this stage play on film effect into consideration however this really is an exceptional performance of a unique and macabrely comic musical in the operetta style lansbury is astonishing a mixture of silliness stupidity and cunning malice while truly owns the role of the psychotic barber whose clients go to their graves impeccably shaved the overall cast is quite fine and although the film does not let us see quite enough of the set there is enough on display for it to be impressive and the music who can argue with what most consider sondheim's finest work the story itself is extremely well known particularly in england in 1846 thomas cobbled together several urban myths for a short story he titled a string of pearls within a year or so it was adapted to the stage as sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street and in an era that knew little of copyright law variations of the play were soon playing all over england each one however was more or less the same sweeney todd a barber kills the men who come to him for a shave mrs lovett his associate bakes them up into pies and feeds them to an unsuspecting public the sondheim version is specifically based on a 1973 version by christopher bond br br the story is very grand guignol with a lot of blood bodies dropping down and grotesque humor at the same time however the music lyrics and subplot of an innocent in the clutches of evil open out the subject to numerous lyric charms one would not expect sondheim's lyrics are often ironic but never more so than here he intertwines a great deal of wicked satire re industry and capitalism along the way and certainly one cannot fault the strange yet victorian elegant of his complex music br br like the concert version starring and patti this particular film also provides us with several selections that were cut from the 2007 tim burton film version most particularly the opening attend the tale of sweeney todd which runs like a thread throughout the play it is also in my opinion considerably more comic than the film which tends to comedy in favor of a still greater show of blood whatever the case if you are a fan of the story this is the legendary broadway show on tour and it is a knock out recommended br br gft amazon reviewer
<START> ok at the time of writing 65 people voted for this movie bringing it to a 5 out of 10 rating my guess is that only the film crew voted so i'm here to bring some justice to it all br br never has a movie provoked the audience's intelligence more than this one given i laughed out loud quite a bit but the movie story absolutely didn't want me to br br i've seen a lot of bad movies a lot but man this one blows them all away br br speaking '96 computers ridiculous acting and wheelchair chases and we have young who can't get their ideas financed yup life's a cruel joke
<START> an unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with kay francis as the countess chasing everything in pants at the beginning of the film she throws back the for being too young before setting off for the chauffeur the high toned english set she moves in is such a clichÃ©d bunch of ers that it's ridiculous but the topper is basil rathbone as an italian violinist with a chico marx accent my how weel i ever play eet again my is cold it's campy beyond belief
<START> the recent dvd release of good humor man labels the film as comedy it's hardly a comedy rather a dull indie film about a group of losers supposedly set in the 70s there is scant attention paid to period details with overly muted color correction taking its place the monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film perhaps that is the point but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location the bleachers it seems like the packaging of the film as a comedy is meant to deceive people into renting or buying this film which is a complete waste of time
<START> the film opens with a cult leader attempting to resurrect a dead member with his followers chanting for his rebirth as the sun strikes upon them in the desert bill roy believes wholeheartedly in his power and gets so worked up that he collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack unable to keep him alive all those involved doctors and nurses are sentenced for attack with demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse sherri big chested jill jacobson targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance forced against her will with no memory of inflicting such harm host body murders selected victims fortunately fellow co worker nurse tara marilyn begins a rather blossoming romance with a blinded patient marcus washington prentiss once a star football player whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo through marcus' knowledge passed down from mom tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save sherri before she murders everyone unknowingly meanwhile lover dr peter desmond geoffrey land worries about her present condition and welfare br br well this was my first al adamson film and i must agree with his detractors that just from this film alone it seems he holds them together with paper clips and elmer's glue the animation with which we see the spirit take control of sherri is beyond awful and rather laughable a little soft core nonsense as filler some demonic possession thrown in the mix sherri actually speaks in another voice when she's possessed with naughty nurse behavior the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free spirited and a little bit violence gore the film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with dull dialogue from a rather mundane cast the sexual situations aren't that hard core and al often shoots them without revealing all that much the film looks embarrassingly cheap and there's an absence of thrills although the chilling score which sounds like something from dark shadows does help a little bit jacobson and mary kay pass as nurse beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she'll even screw a nutty patient always complaining of illnesses he really doesn't have with enough chest hair to declare him a neanderthal aren't bad looking and adamson's story line although frail is somewhat coherent it seems he rarely directs films which are overall the movie looks like it cost 5 bucks and adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions or in my opinion create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story john f goff has the role of the hospital's psychiatrist who wants to commit sherri not believing the idea that she was possessed he constantly bickers with peter over her i watched the unrated lost version which i guess is the real version to watch of nurse sherri
<START> after seeing this film i felt sick to my stomach and if i had seen one more minute i would have had to rush to the bathroom and vomit til dawn a sick film that was not funny and was not worth the money any money at all if anybody ever wants to see this movie don't your kids will never forgive you and will claim sickness for a week so if you value your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind please don't see this movie i beg of you don't
<START> with its by adv films i've had a chance to watch the giant majin for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late night horror chiller theaters guess what it's a pretty damn good movie br br the sets are authentic the acting in subdued and believable and the giant majin is stately powerful and i loved the subtle fantasy touches the enchanted wood luck charm etc and the of the god as a little less than 'good' br br this movie is begging for a remake in the new century
<START> ok before i get into this let's go ahead and get the warning out of the way this movie is the quintessential cinematic definition of sleaze there are movies out there that can definitely out shock or out disgust this movie that have way more artistic validity than can be said for this turd of a film so what makes it so sleazy let's take a closer look at wet wilderness for a moment br br made in 1974 for practically nothing this roughie has no real genuine plot to speak of other than portraying what would happen if a family went into the wilderness to relax and spend a day while being accosted by a fat dude in a ski mask wielding a machete looking for kicks the kind that end up with everyone being forced to have sex with each other while being systematically murdered by the masked creep so those sensitive to themes dealing with incest are encouraged to look elsewhere then to really either add a level of surrealism or just demonstrate a complete ineptness for the art of film making the daughter of the group runs away after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a random black dude tied to a tree branch that fat sum bitch left me here for 3 days with virtually no explanation whatsoever he is saved or is he of course not they are caught before they can escape where our killer forces them to have sex as well while forcing the mother to join in ending up with a dead black dude courtesy of a hatchet through the chest when all is said and done then our killer forces the daughter and mother to give him oral sex when one of the women grabs the machete and the movie abruptly ends just like that no warning no tied up loose ends it's simply over now there might be a proper ending to this film i honestly do not know but i have only seen the extremely crude alpha blue archives version their version appears to have the ending either cut out completely or this is how it ends if this was intentional then in film making 101 i'm sure there is some sort of rule of thumb on how to end a film but it shouldn't be done like this fans of the film psycho should rejoice upon hearing the soundtrack music as it's all through the film i'd be willing to bet no rights were licensed or anything also even though this is a violent film there's not a hell of a lot of it so gorehounds will find nothing of real use here none of the violence is graphically shown only the results one of the victims gets stabbed with a machete right above the vagina area also the sex is some of the ugliest sex i've ever seen the interesting thing about this film is it's too ugly a film to work as an effectively erotic porno or turn on anyone but those with a tendency to like things sleazy nasty and ugly but not violent enough to garner any real notoriety with those looking for something really brutal like cannibal holocaust or other flicks like that the only notorious thing about this steaming pile is that violence was added to an adult film a fairly new concept at that time especially when you consider than porn chic was all the rage and the grindhouses that filled 42nd street played stuff like this to a most jaded group of porn mavens this wasn't and isn't mainstream porn at all br br if you were in film making school and there was a list of movie making this film would be a shining example of that lesson this cinematic swill demonstrates what happens when cerebrally challenged filmmakers are given a budget in this case probably about 142 cuz it looks it and ignore all the and turn them into do's yes this film is that bad one more thing those who get offended by racial epithets are also encouraged to watch something else the black man in the film is constantly being verbally abused about his color and the killer is obviously racist but there was no political correctness in the early 70's i'm not sure a film like this could be made today br br to be honest this won't shock anyone or titillate anyone but those who get off on ugliness actually i got bored the sex is so ugly and mundane it's hard to watch with any sense of eroticism so if you chance this you will thank god for the fast forward button the acting if you want to call it that is amateurish at best i mean it's even bad for porno with not one reason to care about anyone or anything in this if you just gotta see this anyway then download it as you'll really feel like a heel if you buy this some things are simply that worthless and wet is the only thing more unpleasant than watching this film would be watching this film sitting in a theater and looking around at the others in attendance watching it too and suddenly feeling unsafe probably not society's greatest collection of thinkers and intellectuals but if you're up for some stupid yet sleazy porn garbage give it a crack it's 54 minutes and yet it feels much longer would love this then again maybe there's something wrong with me for seeking this out in the first place lol caveat sleaze lovers
<START> golden boy is in my opinion one the sleeper lost treasures animes out there a sexy comedy about a young man quest to find his in life and he blunders into all sort of odd jobs that somehow has this rather sexy girl who ultimately falls for him but he not really realizing it its truly something that you can easily miss if you at the name but once viewing it will fall for the comedy silliness that lies inside truly a crime that only produced 6 ova episodes and pilot movie were made however being unique as it is i'm surprised it survived to produce that many if you want a good laugh with high quality anime that is 100 cgi free check this anime out boy who one day may save the world or maybe not
<START> i found this film extremely disturbing is delusional and disturbed to the point of probably suffering from a mental illness the footage shown is him and not an actor but yet it is showing behaviour that ended in death is it appropriate to show actual footage of a suicide let's not mince words the film shows footage of behaviour that directly led to his death br br for those who think that is some kind of hero think again the footage he shot is about him and not about the bears and foxes he claimed to be helping he did no meaningful research into their habits or numbers and did nothing to actually protect them all he did was run around in the bush and convince himself that he was better than everyone else reality is by helping to the animals to humans he exposed them to great risk his self indulgent behaviour not caused his own death but also the death of his companion amy plus exposed his beloved bears and foxes to greater harm br br but i'm also concerned about werner herzog's actions in compiling this film the way he did br br a friend and i have had a long argument about this film who loved this film he believes that seriously disturbed people make for interesting subjects and he cites the movie downfall as an example but in downfall they use actors we didn't see the real put cyanide capsules into her own children's mouths br br there was something about using the real footage in grizzly man which reminded me of that horrible football stadium tragedy where people were being crushed to death and the photographers who could have helped elected to simply keep recording the horror br br herzog's film shows us that footage is more about but herzog has done the same his own personality and opinions are aired in this documentary which is supposedly about someone else scenes such as the one where he listens to the tape are not necessary we already knew what was on the tape because the coroner had told us we didn't need herzog shedding a tear with one of former girlfriends it didn't add to the film br br the film showed us that was very self indulgent but it also showed us that herzog is as well
<START> campfire tales 1997 br br an excellent peace of work everything about this film is just perfect br br the film has a great cast as you can see from imdb the reason i brought the film was because of christine taylor and the love for horror films lets get to the main parts br br 1 there are 4 teenagers in this film after crashing their car they decide to tell some spooky stories 2 there are 3 stories and the main plot the 4 teenagers are the main plot 3 the best story is people can lick too in my opinion the least scary story is possibly honeymoon or the 2nd story can't remember the name br br 4 people can lick too is about a man pretending to be a 13 year old girl over the internet he starts chatting to a girl called amanda and then enters her house very creepy stuff this story will make you think twice of chatting to someone online basically a pervert enters her house and things go creepy br br 5 the main plot is sweet and simple teenagers crash tell stories try to freak each other out but there's a very cool twist at the end br br the only bad part of this movie is the teenagers crash their car into another couple but the kids don't bother seeing if the couple are ok they just talk about the couple who they've crashed into br br the men and women who made this film made it to scare people not to make money unlike scream and i know what you did last summer this film is created to scare you scream and i know what you did last summer were made to make big time cash br br even though this movie wasn't pushed as publicly as scream was it's still 10 times better than scream and i know what you did last summer br br the characters in this movie are great and have realistic characteristics the cast who play theses characters are great christine taylor does a fabulous job with lauren doesn't go over the top with the acting the dude who plays eric laurens younger brother also does a good job of showing men or teenage boys can also get freaked out screams is like a spoof movie the murderer is a joke and the kids are dumb br br unlike scream and i know what you did last summer this movie has realistic people not a goof of a movie should of been more noticed
<START> that's the worst film i saw since a long time historic accuracy is totally non existent for example james wolfe who his depicted as an anti french canadian is shown in london during the summer of natives are like indians of a bad hollywood movie of the 60's they wear clothes and ride horses the had never ride horses the film is taking place in quebec city but footage is set in showing the atlantic ocean br br the original scenario was supposed to include the battle of the plains of abraham but the producers drop this idea saying that costs for uniforms and participants would be more than 4 millions dollars i think they never heard about re enactment br br all the movie is planned to be a new titanic an impossible love during an historic tragedy the fall of new france there's even a song performed by celine dion at the end of the movie yes i stayed till the end of the movie but i deeply regret but the worst thing of all is that this movie cost 30 millions dollars i just don't know how they spend all this money br br sorry for my anger but i'm just too irritated
<START> right there good entertaining and accurate era feel to most scenes enough personality variations to cover the real people around those days without story distractions from the exceptions the credits show peralta from mar vista california up the hill from venice and south of malibu i lived there in the heartbreak hotel days pre next to that surfer kid bob cooper up on avenue where the alley was used to burn surfboards that didn't work old were used on plywood cutouts to roll down sidewalk waves things were different in each succeeding decade as the cool innocence of the fifties broke into the warmth of the sun whitewater freedom and exhilaration of the electric sixties and then into the innovative playtime and inventive evolutionary madness of the weird seventies the movie gives you a piece of that kind of magic moment in time in a place where the imaginary wave was real the source of culturally significant influences and btw there's another movie that has a similarly american street edginess to it and has the same genuinely unique goodness with laid back realness that helps refine that elusively eternal sense of cool two lane blacktop with one of the best examples of attitude in west coast california history dennis wilson like monte hellman did with that one thanks sp for being right there with this one
