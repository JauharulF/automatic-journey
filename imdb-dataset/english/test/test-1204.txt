<START> i've read that paolo inspiration for the consequences of love came from simply observing a businessman alone in a brazilian hotel and speculating what he might be doing there the film unfolds to us in a similar way we view the existence of who has lived alone in a hotel in switzerland for 8 years he is secretive and avoids friendship his life is dominated by order and regularly gradually the truth of his existence is revealed to us until finally his world begins to fall apart br br the mystery of is central to the consequences of love and it works thanks in large part to the superb performance by toni his character becomes all the more intriguing to us as little details are revealed that he injects heroin once a week that he has no imagination although some here criticise the dialogue for not being naturalistic that doesn't matter in my view this is not that sort of film and i think the script is great the camera work is also excellent br br if you have to criticise the film does lose its way a in the later scenes as the mystery of existence is revealed to us and as his world begins to fall apart however the tragic final scenes are every bit as good as the earlier build up
<START> i got a kick out of reynolds saying to his attorney look i've done a lot of shi ty thing in my life but i never killed anyone obviously he forgot about his career which slid down hill after he started making stupid movies like run ' physical evidence was originally supposed to be a sequel to 'the jagged edge' that glen close rejected the verdict is in avoid physical evidence
<START> christian duguay directed this tidy little espionage thriller early in his career it plays on tv pretty regularly albeit with some terrific scenes of violence and sex unfortunately trimmed i finally got around to seeing the theatrical version on a 3 tape from the local video store naval officer aidan quinn is recruited to impersonate the notorious carlos the and gets a little too caught up in the role donald sutherland ben kingsley play quinn's superiors with sutherland a true zealot and kingsley as the more level headed one the first half of this fun flick shows quinn being trained and indoctrinated the second half has him out in the field making love to the woman and shooting it out with sundry enemies the idea is to make the look like a turncoat to the russians and let them take care of the world's most notorious assassin things don't exactly play out as planned at times i almost expected the cast to break out laughing at some of the corny dialogue but they all play it very straight in the end this is one terrific little thriller that deserves your attention the former mistress teaching the highly proper and very married quinn to rough her up lick blood from her face and then go down on her alone is worth the price of admission
<START> i saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline i go to the movies as an escape to leave everything behind and enjoy a story i found this to be a good movie not great but good it was worth my money and my tears br br diane lane was wonderful as always richard gere isn't an over actor he held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect he brings his own style to the movie br br i think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told it was messy and they had other priorities but they wanted to be together and wanted to wait for each other br br i'd definitely recommend it
<START> this bright hilarious english comedy about school girl antics is a neglected gem the significant question is where is the audience the film is rated 10 by most voters but how many voters is that they don't make comedies like this anymore because the films don't get distributed or seen i would never miss a chance to see this old art house classic again but where are the art houses
<START> just when you think that you've seen the worst the zombie sub genre can offer along comes another budding romero and his team of no talent mates to prove you wrong br br i've suffered the zombie bloodbath trilogy endured death valley the revenge of bloody bill sat semi comatose through the zombie diaries and laughed hysterically during zombie '90 extreme pestilence and genuinely thought that amateur movie making could sink no lower however having just watched zombie planet a two hour long festering pile of drivel from writer director george i think i have found the ultimate in awful zombie movies br br in this dreadfully amateurish effort which is part mad max and part dawn of the dead but all bad frank stars as t k kane a tough fighter who kicks zombie ass for a hobby armed only with knives a machete some concussion grenades and what he obviously perceives to be a really mean glare br br after a desperately unexciting opening sequence in which he takes on a horde of dodgy looking zombies kane teams up with a group of survivors who not only have to fend off attacks from the undead but must also must placate a gang of vicious thugs who have taken control of the area by searching for and handing over any valuables that they find br br of course kane isn't the type of man to take orders from a bunch of z grade post apocalyptic bully boys and he sets about teaching the bad guys a lesson mostly by at them in a threatening manner only pausing to periodically rescue pals from zombies br br featuring awful acting from almost everyone involved a dreadful script laughable effects and shoddy production values there is virtually nothing in this film to make it worth a watch to be fair i quite like the basic premise that the zombies are the unexpected result of a highly popular drug that blocks cravings for we learn this when one character conveniently explains the back story to kane who strangely has no idea what has happened but this is about the only vaguely interesting aspect of the whole production br br i have a certain amount of respect for anyone who manages to fund and make their own movie but when the results are this poor that respect is lost when they decide to make it available for public viewing i would've kept this one under wraps if i had made it
<START> well i like to watch bad horror b movies cause i think it's interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie i always compare this movies to for example some spielberg's works and again and again don't understand the huge difference in what i see i like ed wood's movies cause it's so inept it's very funny but people the chilling is not funny and is not even interesting it's extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable there's no acting no screenplay no direction no thrills and not even blood it's extremely inept amateurish film it's definitely the worst movie i had ever seen and i had seen a lot of worst movies believe me i warned you 1 10
<START> this isn't a good movie plain and simple take out the hardcore sex scenes and what you have is a mediocre plot average acting at best plodding direction and dull dialogue add in the grot and you've got mediocre plot average acting plodding direction dull dialogue with lashings of hardcore porn trouble is the nothing special either so it's not a good movie and nor is it a good porno it fails on both counts they can say that women made this movie and they were intending to do this with it and that with it etc but cheap the end result is what counts and what we have here is a mediocre movie with some sex thrown in for shock value to try and con you into wasting your time watching it one of those movies where you'd rather have the time you spent watching it back
<START> x is a beautiful adaption of herman melville's or the the comments on here surprise me it makes me wonder what has led to the overwhelmingly negative reaction br br the shock value is the least appealing thing about this film a minor detail that has been blown out of proportion the story is of downfall and the subsequent destruction of those around him which is overtly demonstrated in his features demeanour and the dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from any other i have seen and turn a fundamentally traditional storyline with controversial twists into an unforgettably emotional epic br br i can't stress enough the importance of disregarding everything you have heard about this film and watching as i did with an open mind you will i hope be rewarded in the same way that i was i felt on edge and nervous from around the half hour mark however the film is far from scary in any traditional sense it will leave you with 1 000 thoughts each of them at once troublesome and thrilling i know i'm gushing here but i feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film it's the best i've seen all year
<START> it's a sad state in corporate hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking routes you've been seeing in the movie house since day one i had literally no idea how this film was going to end because it went left when i expected it to go right when i expected a zag etc this could have easily unraveled into generic suspense thriller or depressing white trash drama but it stayed a course all its own till the end it is a sad story though not because of what happens to alice but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her down this path br br the plot has a quiet dignity of form that's usually reserved for theater but the pacing could use some tightening up either way it's a very good film and for some reason i suspect sour grapes from those who have scored this one low
<START> how often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen with torrid affairs and passionate encounters almost never if what i see as normal life around me is anything to judge by romances as previously stated are hardly ever earthshaking affairs that leave you at the top of the world or batter and bruised br br romance in its every day form as lived out millions of times over around the world is a slow subtle and quiet affair something that grows in you ever so slowly probably without you even noticing it slowly taking over your being no one can tell me when i am in love for if someone did i would not believe him anyway for no one but me would know and even then it is just a feeling a certain knowledge that you are feeling this emotion that you want nothing but the best for someone that you would never want to see them suffer a moment of sadness that you are willing to take a great degree of pain for them i would not go so far as to say be willing to die for your loved one for we are all human and we do not know what we are capable of in the face of death until that moment is upon us br br is the love between the main characters of the film ever so subtle and understated no less noble than that between romeo and juliet the unstated emotions the unsaid feelings convey far more than any repeated shouts of i love you the restraint shown by the lead actor displayed ever so poignantly in the scene where he watches his love interest through the cafe window yet never did he move to make himself known to her was simply heart wrenching to watch would most of us be selfless enough to remain hidden knowing that her emotions and feelings could not possibly be reciprocated br br on another note how will i deal with my own certain death while i can claim i have been seriously ill i can not in all honesty say that i have ever come close to death will i be so calm putting all my affairs in order and leaving instructions for others to take up what i leave behind i suspect i will be calm for i will have little choice in the matter can i be so selfless again the answer will have to be in the negative i can empathize with the anguish knowing that your life is forfeit that fate has dealt you a fatal blow and that future events however little there are of them left are no longer under your control br br life is nothing more than a series of small events the culmination of which may seem great for some in retrospect but only very rarely
<START> the screaming is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video it features passable acting poor lighting a weak story and some of the worst monster effects i've ever seen the plot has a college student being pressured to join a cult by his attractive landlord the cult is a parody of scientology with a book similar to this would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production the monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like you're watching a home video or a public service announcement i think anyone who sees this will agree that movies should be shot on film
<START> did someone find the plot somewhere in the film perhaps it is the thing missing in this pretentious exercise of cinema about cinema it is quite surprising that gordon says that a movie without a plot is nothing it is possible that characters have more to say that the own wim wenders was this phrase in the original plot or the actor decided to send a hint to the director
<START> earnest effort which achieves some success to adapt the classic odyssey story to a '30's nostalgia period piece the adventurers this time are escaped convicts wandering about the depression afflicted south bungling their way into trouble br br the greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack effectively evoking not only the era that this is set in but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film besides its value to the tone of the movie the music is just plain fun to listen to br br what cripples the film is that the characters really aren't that likable in a comedy you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their misadventures instead we have a bunch of selfish arrogant soulless mean spirited nobodies who really have no positive points at all they're not imposing enough to make you hate them either so it's hard to relate to them at all they're offered up as clowns but like people who put clown makeup on and march in parades they just aren't funny br br like the story that inspired it the movie takes these guys on an odyssey encountering a variety of symbolic some even mystical characters everybody is stamped with offensive stereotypes the operative word being stupid people are mocked right and left and consequently no one is left being particularly interesting or appealing the movie doesn't like its own characters and it doesn't let you like them either br br riverside beautiful sirens stolen cars fistfights radio people being whipped with sticks all are thrown at you in disjointed fashion some evoke a few laughs others confuse or bore you i did laugh when a nerdy guy beat the snot out of an especially obnoxious lead character but there were a lot more pointlessly gratuitous scenes an example some '30's dillinger type guy cows with a tommy gun comedy symbolism no just mindless violence which detracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story draws upon br br other adaptations of the odyssey are much better unless you're a george clooney fan rent something else but buy the soundtrack cd the music is great
<START> i heard what people were saying but i ignored them being rushed at blockbuster i grabbed copy of this movie and ran out br br 45 minutes into i was fighting to stay awake there is some attempt to keep the film interesting but it was just bad a chase of some sort takes place but it was long and drawn out the perfect time to make a snack by the time this movie was over i didn't care how ended i just wanted it to end walking in and out of my room checking to see if it was over br br the entire movie is a cliche' the characters and their relationships the plot twists are predictable as well as the ending the actors made the best out of really terrible roles all can say is their clothes were nice but the movie it was just bad
