<START> bad bad bad how do movies like this get made badly written poorly acted i could go on but why bother as an aside note that the characters' first names are the same as the actors playing them this is a dead giveaway that no one on the set is even interested enough in their role to bother learning someone else's characters names
<START> tia carrere was the reason i decided to watch this film as neither the title nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film Â which goes to show me and everyone that a dvd shouldn't be judged by it's cover br br spoilers the film felt like it was along not really going anywhere for the moment Â the awkwardness of paul around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch and the fringe on the otherwise attractive kirsten beck as alexondra lee being too school girlish to watch where those really fashionable in 1995 br br the relationship between vicky mueller tia carrere and todd boomer jason london was tantalising from the start of though that first meeting across the lake Â magical what a beautiful coincidence they should meet again just as he has behaved like a complete moron boomer with two as in in front of alexondra a shame really that we as the audience knew who vicky mueller really was wellÂ the title did give that away wouldn't you think br br what really surprised me was the acting especially in the scene where vicky gives todd a metal version of his alter ego the dog character in the little white jewellery box the actors really managed to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss Â point of no return for todd and vicky a shame really that the film ends with focus on after getting over todd's fathers harvard drive his re uniting with his friends i could envision a whole new film Â following vicky to new york Â there must be a good art university there that todd could attend br br nevertheless a film that does just what we want hollywood to entertain us for the duration of the film did anyone else notice how none of the loves are happy ones in this film todd's mother is slightly insane on the phone 24 7 his dad doesn't find her attractive any more todd's teacher obviously is disenchanted by his wife and vice versa Â todd himself enters into a wonderfully erotic daring relationship which however nice it may be would realistically be very difficult to maintain age difference maturity difference etc and alexondra do not get together because alexondra is not mature enough to handle a relationship her reactions towards the condom the cheating zak's advances etc are all very immature and often involve running away and himself the poor guy Â is too much of a best friend like a brother guy to pull even alexondra br br mind you good film though i gave it an 8 10 brilliant performance by the actors who bring the script to life
<START> the three main characters are all hopeless and yet you only feel sorry for one of them ernesto hopelessly devoted to mercedes this was part of the frustration screaming at mercedes to get a clue and ditch the no good harry to no avail br br then there's the satisfaction steve buscemi has a great part as a transvestite and harvey keitel's moving story of his indignity playing a gorilla for a cheap tv movie is incredible when you least expect it quentin tarintino is doing half a monologue and anthony quinn turns ernesto into a wealthy man br br time and again great moments appear in the story but in the end it's hard to know what to feel about this movie it doesn't have a happy ending or even a complete one but it somehow feels right br br this movie is strange but then so am i no wonder i liked it
<START> a few minutes in not credible what idiot wrote this br br but what's going on who's the bad guy then there's that rebecca de time passes br br the end br br not credible what idiot actually watched the whole thing
<START> always enjoy the classic horror films however this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for john carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments this film was made during ww ii and john carradine was a german nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world bob steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film mantan moreland jeff gave an outstanding performance with great comedy which helped keep the audience attention i hate to criticize a film made in 1943 but this is really a big disappointment if you like john carradine and the roles he played as count dracula throughout many films during the 1940's you just might like to watch john doing his best
<START> i've seen some terrible book to film adaptations in my day but this one tops them all the bizarrely unattractive cast detracts from the story which is in itself untrue to the book mr is nothing like handsome as for catherine morland a rat like appearance makes this heroine a difficult one to sell to a sympathetic audience isabella is nothing like the aphrodite one reads about in the original text and james morland appears in the film far too little to leave the viewer with any understanding of his important role in the story also as others have pointed out before this novel was intended to satirize the gothic craze prevalent in austen's time but it appears that this soft horror film was designed and meant to be taken seriously i'm sure jane austen turns over in her grave each time one of her fans is disappointed by this awful interpretation of what was supposed to be a joke
<START> i would put death wish 3 in the same box as stallone's cobra and commando the box that i would sell for 2 at a garage sale with all the videos inside the story is about the main character coming back from the previous movies' success to ruin it all with this load of trash why did the makers want to destroy the reputation of the past 2 films with this cheap junk the story is so lame that had to be a outrageous sequel i mentioned cobra earlier because it has the same mood that one man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch both this movie and cobra were bent on showing the hero firing his guns at hip level and the enemy falling in large numbers police officers spend hours at the shooting range so why did they get gunned down by gang members firing aimlessly from their hips this movie was so bad i thought for a minute it was death wish 4
<START> i rate movies on this site all the time but i don't normally write comments however in this case i felt compelled to warn others this movie is bad it's probably one of only a dozen movies i have scored as '1 awful ' i know people say this all the time but this truly was one of the worst movies i have ever seen it's easily on the bottom ten anyway br br when it comes to horror movies i have very low standards i'll overlook all sorts of shoddy film making for a good scare but this movie is embarrassingly bad it looks someone bought a video camera at sears and decided to make a movie with his buddies the fact that every single crew member's name appears in the cast list proves this theory i think this movie has lower production standards than your average high school play it's actually a little shocking to see a movie that looks this bad released on dvd the special effects are somewhat effective at times but are still amateurish at best the best thing that can be said about the actors is that at least they remember no to look into the camera most of the time i can't say for certain if they struggling to remember their lines or making them up as they went along any and all attempts at humor are lame this movie is such a colossal waste of time
<START> and abysmal over the top acting you might enjoy this rubbish flick apparently atomic bombs makes life mutate in about a day or two or according to other viewers wake them up or so it seems and apparently massive atomic explosions off the coast of spain doesn't make anyone ask any questions at all coming to think of it the plot doesn't make sense in any way whatsoever why would evil sock puppets attack so the nukes going off for no reason at all doesn't stand out too much br br ok getting past this and the fact that the monster is a glorified thing you make of socks in kindergarten you may actually be able to stand this but for once the complete lack of gore doesn't help leaving the monster attacks in all their naked rock bottom budget glory br br i doubt you'll be able to watch this though so better stay well away
<START> this is the best movie i've ever seen and i've seen a lot i'm not even a troma fan i've never heard of troma before watching this movie br br i had already given up hope to see a great movie until i saw tromeo and juliet this movie is a dream coming true shakespeare would likely be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic there are sex violence humor and satire it breaks many taboos br br this movie is neither disgusting nor stupid it's hard to describe with words how clever funny exciting and witty this movie is the music is great and perfectly fits every scene the characters are very believable and the acting is great i really cared for the characters br br it is certainly not for troma's fans only it's for all people who have a sense of humor and like clever and believable entertainment as opposed to totally stupid and unbelievable mainstream movies that don't dare to do what this movie does br br the bad reviews only prove that this movie is great and something exceptional you either love it or hate it like all true works of art it isn't understood and appreciated by all people
<START> in the only act of commonsense they have ever made the film television office refused to fund this film the producers kicked up a big stink in a blaze of publicity took their production to victoria apart from the lost work for technicians were lucky not to have been involved br br the film fails on just about every level the post modernism fails the casting fails what is rose byrne's character all about which 1 dimensional snarling nasty did hugo weaving channel what the hell is pia miranda's character doing and the story is a clichÃ©d mess of contradictions in fact the story runs like a dragged out prelude rather than a complete plot line br br it might have had a chance if the pop culture meets depression style was better thought out and executed if the casting was quirkier if the style was less serious if just about everything was different br br apart from the usual excellence in costume design cinematography like most australian films the film is just a total miscue br br at a reported budget in excess of the tender hook is a symptom of the malaise of the australian film industry the wrong people and the wrong projects are getting funded compare this mess with noise under or cedar boys under and you get the idea the tough interesting films are struggling for funding and the flabby overblown projects with name casts are getting the bucks br br the funding bodies who invested in this deserve to go the same way as hugo weaving's character at the end of the film
<START> i was expecting a lot more of this film than what i actually got the acting was just awful from everyone and the story was far from impressive it took a lot of something i don't to even follow what was going because it was so jumpy an example of the acting is when paxton's character is upset the south vietnamese colonel for so he throws some of the sand from the sand map it was impossible to get any idea of what he was feeling and his actions were robotic to make things worse i have no idea how i'm supposed to feel about he's obviously presented as the protagonist but as soon as he gets to vietnam he starts an affair with an vietnamese english teacher the only thing the movie had going for it was that it wasn't particularly boring i give it 4 stars out of 10
<START> pepe le moko played by charles boyer is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout europe and to stay free he holes himself up in the a mysterious part of algiers where even the police are reluctant to go until a senior officer is sent from paris to capture le moko once and for all for le moko although the allows him to remain out of police custody it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time a place he can't leave because the moment he does he knows he'll be arrested br br boyer's performance was good and i can understand why he was nominated for an oscar he captures the essence of such a character a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time the movie itself unfortunately was quite a letdown a number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent of which i'll mention two first was the idea that the police wouldn't enter the that was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the fairly regularly so neither the suggestion by commissioner that the police wouldn't enter nor the statement by inspector also a decent performance by joseph calleia that they could get into the but not out seemed to make much sense i also found it difficult to believe that le moko hardened criminal mastermind that he was could be so quickly swept off his feet by gaby hedy lamarr to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the to find her essentially giving himself up i understand the irony of the final few scenes of course as pepe leaves the freedom of his prison the only to find real freedom in his capture because he's shot and killed by the police i just found it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such a trap br br this is worth watching for boyer and to a lesser extent calleia but the story is disappointing and inconsistent 3 10
<START> i just wanted to say that when i was young my favorite t v show back in the day was night heat i loved the characters and the plot of the show i thought that it was an excellent show and still do to this day i enjoy watching the reruns and i am a big fan i love the way the characters played off one another i would always stay up late to watch my favorite show with my mother who also was a big fan now i can enjoy watching my show again and listening to the theme song which i thought was a cool song for the show my favorite characters were scott hylands and jeff wincott i enjoyed watching these handsome guys take down the bad boys
<START> gary busey is superb in this musical biography great singing and excellent soundtrack the buddy holly story is a much better movie than la bamba from reading other comments there may be some historical inaccuracies regardless it is a fun toe tapping film and a good introduction to buddy holly's music
