<START> i picked up a dvd at the discount having no idea what it's about but at that price i can't resist in brief i was positively surprised br br so much that i did quite some research on the german dvd part 2 of a series of 3 episodes were into two 85 minute parts and out of order here are my results based on episode list br br doomsday is in my boots the voice final episode br br war of the machines is hel high water 1 2 pod listener juggernaut down br br well what can i say girlies are of course interesting for older men i never watched charlie's angels so much so i can't compare but the more i watched the less i looked out for bikini tops and their fillings instead the characters both m and f became more interesting i can imagine feminists have their fun with this too all in all maybe a guilty pleasure but a pleasure it was
<START> very slow dull enigmatic film maybe the kind of film jean luc godard would have made had he been italian certainly conveys how tedious repetitious joyless and empty a person's life can be but i don't usually go to the cinema to find that out the plot such as it is doesn't convince why a gorgeous hotel receptionist an exception to the dullness of the film would be the slightest bit interested in a moody chain smoking silent loner who speaks in 'deep' baffles me very difficult to feel any sympathy with the main character one feels like shaking him by the throat and telling him to out of it ' his brother is a much more human character the ending is inconclusive and puzzling everyone in the cinema when i saw the film went out muttering about how they nearly fell asleep of course it shouldn't have to be a hollywood bruce willis style em up' and but a little bit of energy and action would have made it a lot more thrilling one of the best italian films ever an art house curiosity at best
<START> a touching movie it is full of emotions and wonderful acting i could have sat through it a second time
<START> ok ok i must say i was impressed it's hard to say what i'm more impressed with my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch so that i don't gouge my eyes out or the movie itself either way hitch was pretty darn good hey it was good enough for me to watch twice will smith was funny and good kevin james was just hilarious and absolutely essential for the movie as much as this movie centered around hitch will smith without kevin james it's just not the same br br the story is hitch is a match maker that helps the guy woo the girl his job is to create the chance for the girl to notice the guy when she otherwise wouldn't after the encounter the rest is all up to the guy to make or break the relationship he works on only and stays largely unnoticed during the process albert kevin james is hitch's project this time around and albert has eyes on cole amber a paris hilton type figure while that plot unfolds hitch himself has eyes on sara eva mendes a sharp independent fanged gossip columnist that wants nothing to do with a relationship br br the two stories make for some funny moments and they tie together for a bit of a quagmire of course no love story is complete without the obligatory miscommunication misunderstanding or mishap to send the guy chasing after the girl fortunately they make it brief and hitch was a fun and funny movie that flowed very well and rolled along without a hitch
<START> i bought the dvd a long time ago and finally got around to watching it i really enjoyed watching this film as you don't get the chance to see many of the more serious better quality bollywood films like this very well done and but i would say you need to pay attention to what is going on as it is easy to get lost when you start watching the movie don't do anything else i would actually advise people to read all the reviews here including the ones with spoilers before watching the movie sen gave her first great performance that i have seen aishwarya was easily at her best all performances were strong directing and cinematography go watch it
<START> an annoying group of ex students from alto international high school' decide to spend a night in the now abandoned institution where a 'mystery' killer called the watchman played by horror legend paul naschy murders them off one by one school killer features some references to such teen slasher staples like scream or friday the 13th the climatic twist ending looks like from the sixth sense the uncertainty about whether the homicidal watchman is alive or dead provide some mild interest but the characters are one dimensional and the endless scenes of walking through dark school corridors really got on my nerves the presence of charismatic paul naschy almost saves this clichÃ©d slasher flick there is also some decent gore on display including a splendidly bloody beheading it's nice to see of rec fame in a small role 4 out of 10
<START> this movie had reminded me of watching the old black and white movies with my dad more true to life characters looking for love being in love and loosing it old story fresh view larenz tate was so cary grant in style as the character may have been in a situation but the actor kept him from looking silly and like a cardboard cut out long has always been a favorite of mine she is sweet even when she is tough almost like a hepburn this is one of his best work and showing that he is better than always playing an angry black man br br this movie is a classic superb acting well written a real love story set in chicago what more can you ask for br br superb black love story
<START> well my dad drove lee evans back and forth the hotels so i got to see some being made its a brilliant film bob pugh walked past a shed with a lawnmower and he accidentally let go and it went into a fence and he fell over br br lee evans was also funny as he seen me and said are you cold i said yes and he said well whack your hands in your pockets i think it was really funny and it will be a well known comedy as like every other lee evans film they were really great people they seemed to be quite polite and funny i would like to meet them again one day brenda blethyn walked out of her caravan with blood down her and twigs in her messy hair and i got really scared as i didn't notice her until she was right behind me
<START> i like all different types of movies so this is not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes the matrix etc etc br br i just felt it was a lousy movie i don't feel that there was enough buildup of the characters to fall in love they were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe hurricane and major issues in each of their lives richard gere and diane lane fall hopelessly and helplessly in love it isn't realistic this movie didn't make me buy into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot some emotional connection if someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly without any true substance than so be it you are neither right or wrong different strokes for different folks br br another very unbelievable component to the movie was diane lane's very rude teenage daughter becoming nice and sympathetic at the end of the movie does a teenage girl who is that miserable and aggravated at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice this movie in a nutshell had some big names but to me was a major disappointment
<START> having seen the full length film kieslowski made out of this episode of the decalogue years ago came back to this viewer as we watched the complete ten vignettes as with the other films this one is loosely based on the fifth commandment or thou shalt not kill br br kieslowski writing with took a look at the mind of a young man who commits a heinous crime in murdering an innocent person to vent his own frustrations this installment has a dostoyevskian character that kept reminding us about crime and punishment or at least some of the qualities of the novel are passed to the aimless youth who apparently has no redeeming qualities br br the story shows the young man as he roams the streets of the city without a clear idea of what to do or where to go the only tender moment he displays is when he visits the photographer's place to ask to have an old picture of his sister restored kieslowski leaves it up to fate to have the murderer board a taxi with the intention of robbing the driver but it's his anger and frustration that get the best of this youth to kill a man that didn't deserve to die the last moments of this criminal is one of the most gripping sequences in any film past or present br br the other element in the story is the relationship between the public defendant and the criminal nothing can prevent the court to condemn to death the young man the lawyer feels at the end he has failed his client and goes to the judge to see where he went wrong all he is asked by the young man is to retrieve the picture and send it to his mother br br kieslowski's account of how he interprets the fifth commandment makes for a surprising film that will stay in the viewer's mind long after this episode is forgotten
<START> back in the mid late 80s an oav anime by title of bubblegum crisis which i think is a military slang term for when technical equipment goes haywire made its debut on video taking inspiration from blade runner the terminator and maybe even robocop with a little dash of batman bruce wayne iron man tony stark and charlie's angel's girl power thrown in for good measure 8 episodes long the overall story was that in 21st century tokyo japan year 2033 living machines called boomers were doing manual labor and sometimes cause problems a special swat like branch of law enforcers the advanced police ad police for short were formed to handle the boomers but were mostly ineffective prompting millionaire scientist stingray the daughter of the scientist who made the boomers to create four powered combat armor hard suits to be worn by women to fight the boomers and fight the evil corporation that produced the boomers that group becomes known as the knight sabers and in addition to ring leader her rag tag band of rebel women included a struggling rock and roll gal with a passion for motorcycles and a disdain for cops an aerobics instructor with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through boyfriends and nene a young officer of the and expert computer hacker the first in a long line meanwhile is represented by quincy a tall gaunt old guy who happens to own the company his younger assistant brian j mason killed in episode 3 and an annoying boomer man named largo other characters included leon and daley wong two ad police detectives leon appeared in a spin off prequel anime ad police files which i heard was very dark their balding overweight boss chief todo younger brother mackey and a funny little mechanic known as dr raven who apparently helps with maintaining the suits aside from the overall knight sabers ad police vs storyline there was also another storyline involving a friend of who was apparently a daughter in a big crime family the annoying largo trying to usurp and various wants revenge for a minor character story oh and did i mention that there were hints that herself might have been a boomer br br well it was a great watch full of chaos and mayhem and even some very nice pop songs but it was not without its flaws some of which unfortunately were due to the fact that the series was discontinued after episode 8 when it was originally planned for 13 episodes in all so some of the storylines like largo's scheme or schemes the family of ill fated friend and origins were never resolved another problem with the series was that at the time was the most popular character so a good portion of the series focused on her and unfortunately most of the oriented episodes basically focused on self righteously seeking justice revenge for some secondary character who had never appeared before but happened to be a friend of hers yet she rarely went out of her way for her the knight sabers who were always her out of trouble and for some reason cared a great deal about her well being just to be fair though she did go to rescue in episode 7 and her boyfriend got killed by a boomer and the acted wrongly in the investigation this meant we didn't really get to focus on the more interesting back story of or even the day to day antics of nene and had two episodes oriented around her which pertained to her friend with the mafia family while nene managed to snag the last episode for herself which showed her eternal good cheer was genuinely good spirits and not nene also got to put her computer skills to good use quite a bit or she sometimes just acted like a lovable goof which put her screen time and character development a few notches above poor who was often thrust into the background with only her greed and her tendency to eat up boyfriends to get her any attention don't get me wrong i like it and i love the overall concept of it all but it did irk me a little bit also this is one of those runner ups for worst english voice dubbing of all time features meaning you'd better stick to the japanese some of the voices were okay some really did match their characters personas but others were just flat and passionless or in the case of really overacted br br well tokyo 2040 comes along and pretty much tosses all that out the window set a few years ahead the story here is that after earthquakes shattered tokyo boomers rebuilt the city into a big old paradise except the boomers still have a tendency to fly off the handle which prompts the ad police to be formed followed by the knight sabers being formed so the overall story is the same but the backstories of the characters and the look and attitudes of the characters have changed a lot br br 1 originally had short purplish black hair and brown eyes was usually dressed like a stern proper business woman and was distant from others 2040 has more of a super model look to her dressing more provocatively and possessing white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light runs the gamut from blue to purple to silver and eyes occasionally looking purple or gray and also 2040 is more of an emotionally unstable woman who flies off the handle when she's not in public and possibly keeps even more secrets than before also doesn't take as much risk on the battlefield as she is more of a stay in the mobile pit type here but she does do battle when she has to br br 2 originally was a short woman with an afro and a really bad temper always picking fights with people who offended her always biting off more than she could chew etc 2040 however has gone the way of the clint eastwood loner very cold very stoic and emotionally distant more like the original you might say so she's not really attached to anyone also her hair is more and cat like a big improvement and she is clad in leather like trinity from the matrix although much less annoying than before unfortunately the writers screw her in the end when revealing her reasons for hating the br br 3 originally had this big black hair going for her but now her hair is shorter and well more 90s like 2040 is also an office lady who has bad luck with being sexually harrassed as if to apologize for the way she was treated by the oav writers the 2040 writers actually dedicated the first 6 episodes to writing her as a country girl new to the city but determined to meet the knight sabers and win a spot with them which she eventually does br br 4 originally a short red haired girl who was often the victim of ridicule and ate a lot of candy nene is now a short blonde haired girl who likes to tease and take pot shots at detective leon revenge for him toying with her in the oav and other characters even her surrogate big sister and mackey brother whom she becomes infatuated with and arrogant she still eats a lot of candy and is a master hacker but she is eventually deflated and grows beyond her comic relief status br br 5 nigel kirkland is a new character a tall stoic ruggedly handsome man with long black hair he looks like adrian paul from tv's highlander he replaces dr raven from the old series and now serves as the man who gives to hard suits nigel is also lover but you wouldn't know it by his demeanor he's kind of the father big brother mentor figure to mackey br br 6 leon and daley are back but of course differently the original leon was a tall pretty boy built like a baseball player with slicked back brown hair blue eyes a black leather jacket tight blue jeans and always carrying a revolver that could magically pack more than a if necessary while he wasn't really a bad guy deep down he was kind of a jerk but he served mostly as comic relief as he tried to pursue romantically exactly what he saw in her is a mystery but occasionally he and daley served as information guides to important plot points also the original daley was a fairly muscular red head who dressed in pink purple suits as he was a flamboyantly homosexual character who was always hitting on leon when not providing important information in 2040 leon is no longer a pretty boy but more your typical rugged tough guy type with spiked black hair brown eyes tall and sporting big muscles a brown leather jacket and blue he actually looks like arnold schwarzenegger a little bit or maybe a pumped up colin farrell or hugh jackman and he still carries a revolver a big one but it's not as powerful as before although 2040 leon still has a bit of an attitude especially in approaching he's not nearly as much of a jerk as he was in the old series but he does have a bad temper and he is easily annoyed by nene and daley also he drinks way too much coffee oh and leon is still after but he has a lot more luck this time around daley meanwhile is now a taller but not as tall as leon more pretty boyish looking guy with red rimmed glasses a white suit green eyes and light brown hair and he carries a big machine gun he actually looks like james marsden from the x men films daley is a lot smarter and more assertive in 2040 than the oav and although it's not completely clear his homosexual tendencies have been almost totally disappeared save a moment of what appears to be jealousy when he hears about leon inquiring about e mail br br 7 brian j mason what does that j stand for is back and so is quincy but mason is much more the main villain here with quincy as co villain as he is no longer a towering figure of terror but a vegetable with a bunch of batteries and wires plugged into him mason now sports slicked back brown hair instead of black hair as he did in the oav he actually looks like oav leon in a suit and he is very much from the alan rickman school of villains br br 8 though a pervert in the first series mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040 of course there are lots of things different about mackey in 2040 but they won't be revealed here br br 9 now has a companion an alfred the butler type named henderson who worries about her and the gang br br 10 in the original series boomers were like the in blade runner armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions but in 2040 they're more of the dumb monsters on the rampage type most of the time they're just big robots who do whatever they're programmed to do heavy labor combat clean up etc and they have this tendency to go rogue which means try to evolve and become a monster in the process br br what does stay the same is the theme of humanity vs technology do machines have souls sadly this series though well animated and well written only runs 26 episodes so it moves by faster than one might like especially those of us who are used to more than one season of our most beloved characters and unfortunately it still ends on a cliff hanger with unresolved storyline bits which i will not discuss here what saves this show and makes it what it is however is the characters a colorful cast of screwballs they are ranging from stoic loners psycho women genocidal mad men rough neck cops sardonic intellectuals wise old sages and loveable innocents much more diverse than before and with a lot more to play off of they're enough to make you wish this show had gone longer br br it's not great but it's a good watch also the english dub by adv is quite good though not without a few flat spots but certainly better than the dub on the original
<START> of all the movies in the history of movies i can't imagine someone sitting down and saying i want to spend x amount of dollars or pounds sterling to remake that flawed classic film called lots of stories have been turned into films about meteors coming to earth with something sinister lurking inside why not put your money into making a spectacular 3d remake of it came from outer space instead why look for a dingy nudie flick that existed only for the purpose of showing off a rubbery set of monsters and some naked coeds was the script for the 1986 version of so inspiring that these producers felt it had to be done again and this time done correctly when you come down to it the only reason this film exists is to show off britcom cutie pie samantha janus but if you're gonna make a skin flick and exploit sam janus in it you'd better have her more naked than this and naked more often than this if you want to succeed br br meteor lands monster escapes coeds duff their clothes monster eats people and another what if ending ensues br br honestly i never thought i would ever recommend the original over any other film but this would be the one to come in 2nd place to it
<START> i remember this film as the other person that commented said i recorded over it but wish i had it now just because it had to be one of the worst movies ever funny in a real bad way i remember the tag line on the box was the ultimate frontal lobotomy i got it from my mom who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst cheesiest movie she had ever seen so my mom said my son will probably love it and the woman gave it to her just to get it out of her possession i then later taped over it which i regret i also remember the screw thing was one of those ball catcher things the yellow cone shaped things with a red button at the end and when you hit the red thing it sends a ball flying well they used that with a crank on one end and a corkscrew in the funnel when the killer killed they would show him coming forward with the weapon and then cut to a close up of what appeared to be raw chicken and fake blood on the victims head i don't know what else to say about this gem except that if you like bad films it doesn't get any worse than this
<START> spoilers for some strange reason oliver stone's talk radio based on the stephen singular book talked to death and the films star eric play about the 1984 murder of denver talk show host alan berg has never gotten the recognition that it so rightfully deserved the 1988 movie was prophetic enough to recognize the underground movement that was developing in the farm and hinterland of america a movement that spawned some seven years later the likes of an angry and disgruntled gulf war veteran timothy mcveigh who's hatred for the us governments actions in texas lead to his and friend terry nichols detonation of the us federal building in oklahoma city on april 19 1995 that took the lives of 168 people the worst act of terrorism on us soil up to that time br br the movie is as far as i know the first time that any major branch of the entertainment media mentioned and elaborated on the rural militia novel the turner diaries by the late william l pierce that has since become a chilling underground classic the turner diaries forecast a domestic and utterly disastrous terrorist attack like the oklahoma city bombing on a us government federal facility which was the fbi building in washington d c br br dallas radio station talk show host barry eric bogosian is the top rated show in the dallas listening area and is now about to go national barry get's his high rating by his razor sharp wit and abusive behavior when he's on the air taking on all comers and ducking no issues no matter how unpopular or taboo they are has gotten barry to be the most listened to as well as hated man on radio barry being a showman at heart and not thinking that his talk can lead to violence keeps up his to his call in listeners as his rating go up to the but there are those in the listening audience mostly ultra right wing types that don't take too kindly to his in your face attitude one of them decides to take matters into his on hand at barry's expense br br powerhouse performance by eric bogosian as the tragic barry who crossed the line from entertainment to hard reality in his actions on the radio thinking that he's not that important to be sought out and murdered for his on the air opinions which is enemies dislike he found out only too late that there are those out there who are crazy enough to do to him on the outside also in the movie talk radio is a very young baldwin as barry's boss dan who tries to have him soften his tone but in the end goes along with his talk show style since he's killing the competition not realizing that in the end it's him that he'll end up getting killed br br both ellen green and leslie hope are the two women in barry's life his ex wife ellen and now lover and talk show producer laura whom barry uses to his advantage and almost ends up losing both of them at the same time the 1988 film talk radio is so far ahead of it's time that even if you watch it now in 2005 you still think that it's too disturbing to be shown to an over sensitive and delicate american public
<START> i just saw this movie on showtime in the wee hours of the night i was viewing the beginning with one eye open but instead of drifting off to sleep i became invested in this crafty nail bitter of a movie it was very believable and engaging i could have done without so much profanity as with every david mamet movie i see but thoroughly enjoyed the experience i know teenagers swear but i don't need to listen to it anyways the story had some interesting surprises which i won't reveal but if you have a chance to catch this movie on showtime i think you will enjoy it as much as i have
