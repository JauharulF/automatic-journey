<START> in general i prefer horror movies that creep me out so much i'm afraid of everything for the next day or so not the ones where people act stupid and get killed by an indestructible monster this is one of those movies the of legend is a dog faced lizard skin greenish gray monster that hops like a kangaroo has fangs and claws has a row of sharp spines sticking out from its back and sucks the blood of livestock as in many horror movies good and bad this movie takes liberty with the legend it not only attacks humans but it eats their intestines and has a bulletproof nearly indestructible constitution so tell me how can a hypodermic needle penetrate its skin when bullets can't and why when the marines figure out that armor piercing bullets can hurt it do they split up so the can pick them off one by one john rhys davies gives a performance that rises above the bad movie and simmons and dylan neal deserve credit for their performances too otherwise the rest of the acting was poor to bad just like the rest of the movie my rating is based on rhys davies simmons and neal
<START> now you guys i loved this film though not quite as much as farewell to the king another beloved john milius epic it was fun a lot more than if it were based on a tennessee williams drama it's a great yarn with a whiff of political correctness i love this film for its beautiful photography its humor and its criticism of the bad guys and the real bad guys the spear carriers for the world with their repeating rifles artillery and large gunboats out there in the harbor br br the standout scene is the berber with blue gray smoke from the cooking fires rising into the chill desert air it is visually eloquent highly evocative br br set in 1904 morocco wind features a helpless american woman candace bergen who is taken hostage by a dashing albeit immodest berber bandit sean connery the very model scottish muslim nomad the exciting story is based on a few historical facts the photography is milius beautiful punctuated by jerry goldsmith's outstanding score br br mrs and the conduct protracted foreplay and bounce around in the desert between even though the proudly traces his lineage back to the apes he is a perfect gentleman he even lets her keep her head after she beats him at chess a marine detachment storms the palace putting out the fires of competing with gasoline don't mess with the corps abdul br br there are many entertaining stereotypes br br despicable sultan resembles a dissipated ferret definitely not a liberal br br cruel german officer a large bellicose dachshund sporting a monocle he chooses to fight the with swords instead of gunning him down in the manner of indiana jones oblige by way of von br br dashing marine officer kicks the crap out of the of army and storms his palace while chewing tobacco his speech is mildly the begged him not to breathe on him br br the a horde of sycophants led by a charming megalomaniac none of them take baths except perhaps in camel urine br br president teddy roosevelt is undeservedly portrayed as vacuous and preoccupied with guns toys and stuffed grizzly bears br br beautiful american widow gives the men a lesson in courage as do her two children she evidently has a huge supply of clean starched clothes and rarely has a hair out of place br br the sends teddy roosevelt a message thanking him for the gift of a remington repeating rifle declaring br br roosevelt you are the lion and am the breaking wind br br how true br br please do not take my acerbic remarks to mean that i did not like the film i had almost as much fun writing this as watching da pitcher
<START> perhaps this movie is a little too long but it still has some charm 45 years later the main roles seem more appropriate for clark gable and vivien leigh i could care less about gary cooper but ingrid bergman is fine particularly in dark hair the movie is worth seeing for the supporting cast flora robson is terrific as a servant she is a white woman in blackface and can have an expression of evil or of a voodoo mistress jerry austin as a servant dwarf has a delightful role that keeps you chuckling despite some overlong scenes speaking of scenes florence bates steals most of the ones she is in as a dowager social lady i didn't understand the outcome of the railroad fight at the end of the movie and the last scene was pure hollywood dreck it's an odd feeling when you realize the film title refers to a railroad rather than a piece of luggage
<START> french cancan is one of my favorite all time movies it's an excellent film there's color there's humor there's music it's a very good portrait of the so called belle though jean renoir's priorities were always to show a creation a so the film isn't a historical movie the final sequences in which the girls dance cancan are unforgettable images it's a film you shouldn't miss
<START> i quite this anne rice book adaption while most of the film is filmed here in australia it offers a great amount of scenery and a fantastic area to shoot in lestat stuart townsend has recently woke up from a long period time of sleep and has decided to betray his vampire oath by revealing himself to a band when he becomes a popular movie icon his fellow vampires go mad and plot his death meanwhile jesse marguerite moreau a orphaned member of the supernatural studies who has an ancient vampire family tree has become deeply obsessed with lestat her boss david paul mcgann understands her obsession and his obsession with the vampire marius vincent perez who is an ancient vampire and the man who made lestat a vampire too jesse is given diary and reads of his first killing and an encounter with the queen of the damned aaliyah when lestat holds a concert in death valley he receives news that not only will angry vampires be there may come as well meanwhile has other plans she goes to a vampire coven a bar and kills everyone in her path with lestat tempted with and loving care by the ancient vampires consisting of marius and aunt lena olin plot against them join her or die br br i thought the film was fantastic it had great fight scenes great music and great locations aaliyah sadly passed away in a plane crash shortly before the films premiere but she looked stunning on the set and off the sets br br i gave this film 10 10 because it was a fantastic film and i urge you to see it
<START> this is an unfortunately unrecognized classic br br the look is superb the design costumes etc are flawless the post battle scenes and the cavalry charge are both chilling and exciting br br the characters are vivid and really human ardent is right and luchini as the lawyer steals the movie with his clever pedantic rodent like performance delighting in the ups and downs of others' misfortunes depardieu is good but perhaps too large a presence for this role br br where the film really excels is the story and also its changes from balzac's novella those changes are editorial in that balzac has lots of discussion on society and this film breaths with characters nevertheless yves angelo has retained the key ingredient not just the missing man trying to regain his place in society but every character has to find their place in society the comte is trying to buy a his wife ardent comes from a lowly birth and when she was married to colonel chabert they achieved their position in the turbulence of post revolutionary france everyone has something to lose in terms of status and that makes for a good drama as their objectives are in conflict with each other br br it also feels very modern money is critical to buy status to reach power but someone can go down as quickly as they go up enjoys the strategy he has seen the worst of people he says to chabert when he takes the case this original place is at the end of the novella as balzac sums up the human comedy with huge irony
<START> john wayne's first starring role just blew me away televised letterbox style on amc i had to check and make sure i had the right date sure enough this 1930 film was made using a 55 mm wide screen process aside from that it features some of the grittiest most realistic footage of the trek west i've seen wagons men and animals are really lowered down a cliff face by rope trees are chopped by burly men and burly women so the train can move another 10 feet the indians are not the pretty boy city slickers who portrayed them later they're the real deal a river crossing in a driving rain storm is so realistic it has to be real in fact i understand that director raoul walsh nearly lost the entire cast during this sequence i could smell the wet canvas each day is an agony the various sub plots are forgettable but the film as a whole is not i can't think of another title that can beat the big trail in evoking a sense of living history on the trail to oregon bravo
<START> this is officially the terrible boring corny and ridiculous movie ever created the movie is all about a crazy kid and his friends and they land a 747 his dreams are very corny and make no sense at all and is very poorly done every special effect looks as if it was done without any modern technology and might have been created by the kid that plays the leading role in the movie if you watch this movie it will definitely make you stupider i advise you to never consider watching this movie and if you do good luck and don't miss the brain cells you killed off my comment does not even fully grasp the awful creation from hell that has been made the person that wrote the comment before me did not watch the same movie that i dreadfully watched and wish i never watched peace
<START> thirty per cent of this movie appears to be the prototype for the map channel you see a giant map for about ten minutes then they unleash the stock footage big time while droning droning get it on about radar apparently there's a lot of radar stations in the far north protecting north america's borders from attacks by deadly polar bears the bears never show up but a giant mantis does it was frozen in the ice for over a million years or so until it was released by an earthquake somewhere else in the world yeah right for my money it was released by global warming it is a huge prehistoric insect and it needs lots of food since there aren't any cows in the frozen north it decides to feast on the most like creatures it can find up there i e human beings it starts attacking radar stations probably because the humming from the radar dishes was getting on its nerves br br enter col joe the resident smarmy guy of the film he's investigating a plane that went down and is puzzled why there are no bodies in the wreckage the only thing he finds is one of the claws of the mantis apparently it decided to trim its nails while it was snacking on the plane's crew takes the claw tip back with him to be analyzed by a thousand year old scientist br br grandpa scientist can't make heads or tails of the claw mostly because he's missed his naps so his mind isn't functioning too well so he calls in a smug paleontologist played by the guy who was the p i in perry mason he and his friend a transvestite photographer fly north because he's decided that the claw must have come from a praying mantis just one the size of a commuter train br br it's luke warm love at first sight when col first sets eyes on the she male photographer the men at the base obviously having been deprived for many years think she's the hottest thing to come along since granny clampett smug science guy and smarmy soldier guy start working together to track the path of the mantis which has devastated some stock footage of an eskimo village it comes to the base looking for an after dinner snack and crushes some cheap sets quite effectively then it flies south and disappears br br now comes the tense hours when the civilian ground observer core are called on to sweep the skies looking for anything large flying overhead i doubt that in reality they would have been told that they were looking for a giant flying mantis that eats human beings since that would haver caused a panic probably they were told to look for a giant that was painted green and because its engine was out of tune br br col goes up in a plane to try to shoot the mantis down and botches the mission the mantis lands in new york city probably because it wanted to take in a show on broadway or visit sex world in times square the army corners it in the tunnel and and his men don stupid suits that they borrowed from the man to go in and try to blow the mantis up success well almost since the mantis is still twitching enough that it almost kills the eve arden photographer lady there's a tepid love scene at the end and the paleontologist takes a picture of the dead mantis because colonel hair grease and ms gender unspecified are busy smooching so kind of a nauseating ending
<START> with a catchy title like the butcher of this ed gein variation and kane hodder playing him will no doubt fly off the shelves for a couple of weeks most viewers will be bored silly with this latest take on the life of ed br br the movie focuses on ed's rampage and gives us a few glimpses into his and dwelling in its these scenes that give the movie a much needed jolt br br what ruins this is the constant focus on other characters lives and focuses less on eds big mistake here br br kane hodder is a strange choice to play gein but he does pull it off quite well and deserves more acting credits than he gets these days barnes and micahel also show up br br 3 10
<START> again i've read all of the comments posted here and agree with the many intelligent ones but totally disagree with those who think it was is hokum br br personally i think nuclear is about the only energy left to us unless our governments feds and states increase the grants thinking homeowners will use photo cells on their roofs many attractive and pricey homes in southern are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy around the sun i live in a loft which is exposed to total sunlight on its roof the entire day i hardly use the ac i'm sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees cooler we are blessed with dry heat in this part of the country i'm from the gulf coast of the usa so i know about humidity br br that said i found the china syndrome to be a convincing movie about what could go wrong if the industry is not busy and inspecting nuclear plants i think there are enough comments posted here to enlighten those who still fear it like the plague they are safe is still on line br br director james bridges carefully guides this plot by mike gray t s cook to build suspense and to a thoughtfully interesting film all the roles were well played jane fonda kimberly wells jack lemmon jack and producer michael douglas richard adams are all excellent in their roles plus all of the rest of the cast i too loved there being no score it was so interesting to get a true to life glimpse of the behind the scenes of the tv industry that shouldn't be surprising currently dan rather is sue ing cbs and i hope he wins can you believe donald trump saying he's a loser trump who cares posted a very good comment here i agree it is my opinion that getting vaporized by a nuclear spill is much better than living in a world which has been wasted and becomes blade runner and or green come away from your video games for a couple of hours and watch this dated movie really isn't and get a little education on nuclear energy i recommend it to the whole family
<START> looks as if the robocop writer has been wholesale looting the this is a very solid horror action movie about a man set up in an accident to be used in cruel experiment anyone who have seen robocop knows the story watch out for pam grier as a bitchy and darn good looking assassin this highly effective violent and bloody horror movie may not be to everyones liking but this canadian outing is well worth seeking out for anyone who is fan of the genre 8 10
<START> this movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason definitely not a well made movie so unbelievable the scenes where the president holbrook were downtown and walking among the people were a farce there would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the president in that situation in real life if it wasn't for the blood and profanity this was shot like a tv movie it could have been decent if it was done differently holbrook's president talents were never realized in this movie shatner's acting is okay the production values in this movie leave a lot to be desired overall i think most people would be better off not wasting time to watch this affair
<START> in an era where nearly every great horror film of the 60s and 70s is being remade for audiences weaned on horror flicks of today that are not too terribly good it is instructive to look back at john carpenter's 1982 opus the thing which itself is a remake of a childhood favorite of the director's howard hawks' 1951 sci fi horror classic the thing from outer space although carpenter's film was not initially that big a box office hit when released in mid 1982 it has since garnered a very large following br br in fact carpenter's film is less of a remake of hawks' film than it is a reworking as he goes back to the original idea posited by the source material namely the john w campbell story who goes there in which a us scientific crew in antarctica is menaced by a shape changing alien out from the ice after 100 000 years kurt russell who had starred for carpenter in the director's 1979 tv movie elvis and the 1981 film escape from new york heads a cast of stalwart character actors including keith david donald moffat richard and richard in this tension filled exploration of paranoia as the shape changing thing which first comes to their camp in the form of a guide dog a norwegian team is trying to kill takes over each of them one by one it isn't long before everybody in the camp begins to mistrust his fellow man the ending of the film in which russell and david are the only ones left has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity akin to the similar to both the birds and straw dogs br br almost universally when the subject of the thing is bought up the emphasis is on the extremely gory special effects make up and alien designs created by rob bottin who had worked with carpenter on the 1980 horror classic the fog and on joe dante's 1981 werewolf film the howling these effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic and even today they can also be quite stomach turning but all of this would make carpenter's film nothing more than a high end splatter epic if the direction the story and the acting weren't up to snuff and thankfully each of them are when he's not concentrating on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences carpenter builds suspense in the same hitchcock influenced way that informed his previous films halloween and the fog with cinematographer dean cundey's prowling camera work particularly through the corridors of the station a significant help the acting enhances an already fine screenplay adaptation by bill lancaster and we are also given a taut score by ennio morricone whose work on director sergio leone's classic 1960s italian spaghetti westerns is well known to all including of course carpenter himself the thing also features additional fine visual effects from albert whitlock who worked on many hitchcock films including the birds and roy who worked on close encounters of the third kind and jaws 2 br br carpenter's film was not the success it could have been because universal chose to release this graphic shocker a mere two weeks after it had released steven spielberg's far more family friendly e t the extra terrestrial not surprisingly critics and audiences at the time favored spielberg's excellent film over carpenter's equally excellent but exceedingly different one also most of the horror film box office business in 1982 was going to another spielberg produced film poltergeist as a result at a cost of 15 million the thing suffered from lack of attention in its time br br over time however many have come to see carpenter's film for what it is an extremely gory but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror done with a great deal of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the heart of its story though it is still quite gruesome the thing should be as much remembered for the skill by which the story is put together as it is for the gory alien designs and make up effects for it is the storytelling skill and the suspense that make it so memorable in the final analysis
<START> the movie isn't too bad up until br br the main problem is with the ending so it's a pretty major spoiler br br for the time it was made it's a beautiful movie and does get a lot of it right br br however br br in the book sam succeeds and lives his dream whereas in the movie he gives up and goes back to the city completely destroying the you can do what you put your mind to theme of the book br br this movie is a desecration and instead of remaking classics that don't need redone the hollywood types who haven't any better ideas should do this one right this time
