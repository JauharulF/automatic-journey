<START> maa is different finnish film but the things which makes it different are copied abroad some techniques of narration are from amores perros jackie brown and elephant scenes are shot from different angles again maa is a good movie but it isn't so good that the hype realistic movie no happy end and no commercial some actors did great job was so good as a vacuum cleaner peddler also jasper shows his skills but was so lame he is so overrated actor he's handsome and a nice guy but not the best actor of finland but if you like finnish movies maa is worth to see
<START> ok everybody is so enthused by this film i hardly dare add a negative review but i just did not enjoy this movie br br i have to say first i saw the film in russian language overdub so i will have missed some dialog but not much br br nice things first there are some hilarious moments the elvis impersonator for instance actors seem well casted also the russians is great and goldblum is very good which brings us to the downsides of this movie first of all there is hardly any story and the end we know already wins so no drama or suspense they tried to solve this problem with an emerging affair between the actors mentioned above but that story kind of evaporates br br more importantly the film does not represent reality the russians at the level of politics and society portrayed in this movie are not funny they are a serious and dangerous lot i am willing to believe that flying in some spin doctors from the states helped win his campaign but the real interesting questions that should be addressed are who financed the campaign what did they get in return how was the opposition handled apart from airing some commercials br br so what we have here is a film loosely based on reality but strangely avoiding anything that could make the film either historically relevant or just a very good political thriller without plot or subplot
<START> i'm not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies which it is not even though houston did appear in he played a totally different character he was eight years older in this film okay so reid and martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a film all by themselves but to trade on the hp franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference albeit minor to the earlier movies i'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was hoodwinked into thinking that they were seeing a sequel not a totally different film with a familiar name and i'm sorry whitley is not funny and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris ketty lester or dc curry in the earlier films although good and mari morrow are a substantial visual diversion i have to give this a thumbs down just naming the film down to the last minute would have been ok furthermore the brothers who produced the first three movies were not involved in the making of this film
<START> 'boogie nights' uses its protagonist dirk diggler as a metaphor for accumulated celebrities from a decade in america's shameful past which was comprised of an unexpected rise in pornography therefore resulting in an abundance of corrupted youth its lead character borrows traits from a various assortment of genuine actors involving himself in many illegal affairs that have been dabbled in by celebrities in hollywood and all too often exploited by the press it seems like the sort of tall tale that might appear on an e true hollywood story special drugs sex and violence the american dream but what goes up must come down and the bigger it is the harder it falls br br dirk dreams are huge as is another valuable asset on his body real name is eddie adams a californian who dreams of becoming a star he believes that god gives one great talent to every individual on the planet and his gift is a rather unusual one after falling out with his mother eddie leaves home and meets the sleazy jack horner burt reynolds an adult film director who offers him work eddie eventually becomes a major porn star representing the leading actor in most of horner's films with newfound success eddie is told that he needs to invent a new alias for himself and so dirk diggler is born br br eddie dirk himself is primarily based on infamous porn star john holmes whose life story was adapted in 2003 with 'wonderland' which starred val kilmer 'boogie nights' is unarguably the better of the two proving that movies about pornography can be made without disgusting its target audience regular cinema goers br br the film takes place in 1977 an era of artistic pornography filmmakers truly believed that they could compensate for the low points of x rated features by adding deep stories and mesmerizing atmosphere in a way the film's director paul thomas anderson implements a very artistic approach to the project resulting in a gratuitous and artistic movie about a period in american history when smut was indeed both gratuitous and artistic anderson's style is so deep and so distinct that we soon feel as if we are reliving the era first hand not a moment goes by where we are unconvinced of the time range dealt with in the film br br all was not happy on the set of 'boogie nights' prior to filming anderson approached reynolds repeatedly asking him many separate times to play the role of horner eventually reynolds agreed but claimed that the film was horrible and the worst role of his career publicly disowning it before being nominated for a best supporting actor academy award and suddenly shutting up a year before anderson had suffered title disputes over sydney hard eight he preferred the latter title for his film and new line cinema thought the former was more marketable he essentially lost the battle and anderson wisely avoided title disputes this time around by inserting the words boogie nights into his movie through the mouth of a character br br the casting of the film is one of its finest aspects the paul thomas anderson regulars are here as well as a whole top notch cast of first timers to name some of the more well known stars john c reilly phillip seymour hoffman luis guzman william h macy heather graham and julianne moore but the entire movie essentially borders down to mark wahlberg as eddie who is surprisingly convincing in his role wahlberg previously known for his singing career and disappointing hollywood pursuits has all the necessary traits to portray such a character this is his best role to date br br anderson knows how to captivate his audience and take complete control of every scene when jack horner first meets eddie anderson slyly uses stars in the backdrop a sign of things to come and hidden symbolism as finely acute as it can be the opening scene is three minutes a long tracking shot that follows jack and amber into a night club where most of the characters are first introduced it reminds me of the discussions regarding tracking shots in robert altman's 'the it works so brilliantly in boogie nights and is the first indication that anderson knows what he is doing behind the camera his style is fast paced in the vein of martin scorsese where shots zip around quite quickly but never seem rushed incidentally anderson references two classic scorsese shots the closing de niro mirror speech from and the tracking nightclub scene from 'goodfellas' anderson is a young growing director who is remarkably mature in story and direction despite his age whereas his first feature film was noticeably wise and poignant 'boogie nights' is even more so br br 'boogie nights' began as an effort of love on paul thomas anderson's account having filmed the extraordinary hard eight in 1996 anderson's film is pragmatic to such an extreme that it almost seems genuine boogie nights invigorates us with its gratuitous content occasionally bordering on the verge of pornography only it is far more sophisticated than such trash it is a blazing wonderful modern day masterpiece that is as mind numbingly explicit as it is wild and stylish arguably anderson's best film and among the greatest and most important projects of the last decade
<START> to understand crash course in the right context you must understand the 80's in tv most tv shows didn't have any point the sitcom the drama at least 3 to 1 they were still figuring out where the lines were so that they could cross them tv shows like hail to the chief was quite the bold step this made for tv movie crash course featured an all star cast bringing together members from all the 80's classics 227 family ties who's the boss et al directors must've had a certain penchant for those all star movies then still this movie offered very light fare and a simplistic view of heroism and maturity and that's not bad sometimes viva soleil moon frye
<START> here's yet another movie with dysfunctional lead characters who are totally amoral and yet we're supposed to root for them not me no character in this film was worth a damn br br robin williams plays car salesman joey o'brien the man has no class a loser in every moral sense and a guy who thinks he can talk his way out of anything knowing williams' ability to talk he was good for this role the women in his life are driving him loony too some of them aren't much better than him br br tim robbins plays a similar low life who starts the take over the film when he fully loaded with explosives crashes into a car dealership showroom and holds people including his wife hostage robbins as in normal for him plays a disturbed and ridiculous character i guess these nut case roles come easily to these two actors gee i wonder why br br there is so much yelling and screaming in this the movie that it will give you a headache combine those two with the nasal voice of fran and you really have an annoying over the top cast this is like listening to chalk on a blackboard for an hour and a half this is comedy no this is lame br br in fact for a robin williams film to only have a dozen reviews posted here tells you something it's a far cry from his best movie
<START> this movie treads on very familiar ground the confusion of art and reality in the life of actors it does not have anything particularly novel or interesting to say on this subject and is in fact rather dull the final scene in particular is interminably tedious seeing the audience crying at the moving acting they are seeing on the screen made me ask who do they think they are kidding br br nevertheless there are some good performances and interesting scenes particularly from some of the minor characters ben gazzara plays an old and slightly touched actor who gets a whole posse of policemen clapping his performance when they come to arrest him br br christopher walken again plays an over the top wacko remember his character the continental on saturday night live an aging eurotrash chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to get her into bed he does an identical turn in the film chasing his young male prey around an antique table and plying him with champagne br br overall this film was both enchanting and irritating but mostly irritating
<START> 'flood' is a prime example of how throwing good actors and cgi at a film will do little to compensate for a rubbish script the basic premise is fine what if a freak storm threatened to send the sea straight over the thames flood barriers and engulf london so fast that most of the inhabitants would probably never get out in time it's basically the new york segment of 'the day after tomorrow' but that shouldn't make it any less of a film however the script just isn't there it's merely functional flat and lacking in depth great british talents like robert and david suchet to name but two do their level best with what they've got but their characters are two dimensional cyphers like something out of an old marvel comic and it'd be frankly easier to turn back the tide not that every actor gets let off the hook tom seemed capable of only one emotion throughout the film but then he wasn't given much of a challenge br br i applaud any opportunity to see some non hollywood disaster flicks for a change and i don't expect zillions of dollars spent on rendering ultra realistic graphics however there's no excuse for shonky writing especially from a country that has produced some of the best science fiction ever made on next to no budget at all this is the kind of half hearted b grade fluff the sci fi channel produces and that's hardly a target to aim for if like me you are such a fan of disaster films you're still tempted do yourself a favour and watch it with some friends better still don't bother
<START> this ultra low budget kitchen sink yawn is the kind of film that can only be made in the uk in that anywhere else in the world the fact the a market would need to exist before a green light would be given most probably self funded this is clearly an attempt to redress important issues but ultimately undermines its point of existence in that the question needs to be begged who would ever put money into distributing this and secondly if a market audience doesn't exist to watch buy or rent this film why would anyone bother in the first place my opinions may sound unfairly harsh on a first time director but this is the kind of film that only goes to undermine the commercial viability and quality standards which have only just kept a british film industry in existence reviewed in edinburgh 2 out of 10
<START> i like dylan moran from his work in black books although i found some of his stand up to be really indulgent in terms of long confused gaps however i was intrigued to see this film starring he and michael caine and curiosity got the better of me br br i was stunned br br dylan's vocal range and characterisation of the different people he was playing in the film was absolutely perfect something beyond the skills of a mere stand up comedian and really truly on a par with alec guinness john hurt and the other greats truly he was skilled in his portrayal br br michael caine was a very convincing prima donna and the standard british film device of having a precocious child on hand to be overly wise and withering worked the only aspect i didn't really like was the unbelieveable plot feature of the chemistry between dolores and the cockney hard man played by dylan br br other than that it was great br br i also like the non cop out ending where it did end up happily ever after but with mc getting a beating ok it's not exactly being strung up by your goolies and which is what a real crime boss would do to you if you nicked off them but it showed at least a small measure of reality in the story br br i liked the film and i would recommend it to anyone but i would also warn them not to turn it off after 15 minutes because it started a bit slow if you stick it out then it will all come back br br and with regards to the swearing well they're in ireland it wouldn't be real otherwise
<START> robert montgomery myrna loy farce about loy irene and her fiancÃ© played by reginald owen stranded in labrador when their plane crashes that's really what should have happened to this highly predictable film montgomery lives there while he is waiting for his fiancÃ© br br surprise montgomery and loy are soon attracted to each other the scene with the bear is so contrived we knew it was a tamed bear all along br br complications ensue when clara shows up loy wants montgomery to tell clara that they should part ways when he refuses she wants to leave at once br br you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how this will end out with all that snow it's just too cold for anyone
<START> the charge at feather river is a routine western about the u s cavalry against the cheyenne indians the film carried a constantly mounting tension with some pleasant diversion br br guy madison and frank lovejoy play the officers who rescue helen and vera miles from the indians br br the outdoor scenes are well photographed specially the exciting indian charge at feather river at the climax of the movie with the rain of spears the fight to the death between madison and the sketches of the brigade even a mouthful of tobacco juice used against a rattlesnake and the romantic interludes between our hero and helen all are here pictorially entertaining in 3 d and technicolor
<START> i saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in 1988 and though i knew it wasn't of award winning caliber i kinda liked it it tales the tale of 5 former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids which is to climb mt whitehead of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways but none too differently than they were as children richard lewis is still neurotic richard belzer is still a playboy franklyn is still sort of the dear abby of the group and tim thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group of course the top billed star is louie anderson a true believer in everything cub scout related he still lives in the same house with his mother still goes over the cub scout manual daily is brave reverent and clean and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in scouting compounding their task however is the brothers two bullies drummed out of the cub scouts by the above mentioned by coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit albeit harmlessly not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts who think pack 7 is from the fbi and are intent on wiping them out all in all the movie still has bits of charm observe richard lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot for example and you have a really funny bit going for you upon further review the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor it doesn't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure
<START> beautiful art direction excellent editing and wonderful stories make this some of the best television ever produced the fact that it was relatively short lived is sadly reflective on the state of television i highly recommend snatching these up as they're released you'll love them
