<START> one of the better musical bios dennis morgan is great as the singer composer chauncey the supporting cast is very good especially andrea king as the glamorous lillian russell the turn of the century atmosphere is the perfect setting the technicolor is excellent a simple plot but the movie just makes you feel good morgan was always underrated as an actor and a singer
<START> as if reality shows like american idol weren't enough in which judges like simon shoot razor sharp barbs to contestants trying to make their mark on the music world barbs that many a time has reduced even outstanding singers to tears after what was deemed a bad performance now america's next top model has for the past three years invaded the boob tube with its own version of looking for the next big thing in a business that values superficiality concepts of beauty and body br br a concept created by tyra banks who is also a judge in the show it gathers some fifteen contestants from all walks of life and has them submit themselves to innumerable tasks in which they must prove their talent in front of the camera and subject themselves not only to the now departed janice dickinson self dubbed american's first supermodel but the equally catty jay manuel and nore marin who may at one point focus on one girl not performing well and blithely rip her to shreds like it was bad morning coffee like in many other reality based shows each week one contestant is voted off and must pack her bags and immediately leave a thing that they are reminded by tyra at every turn of course there is the bitchy tension between several of the more type a females female bonding tears dramatic swells of music in key moments and some truly breathtaking pictures that transform erstwhile ordinary pretty girls into unattainable goddesses br br i'll have to admit the show is a guilty pleasure maybe it's the state of mind i'm in but i kept wondering where the was in cases when the already thin girls would need to hurl to make the cut and look the way the judges and photographers and many fickle designers would feel was correct for the moment even so it's drawn me in despite my previous paragraph possibly because i've always had an interest in the fashion world and have always loved watching stunning women being made even more unworldly with make up and perfect lighting but i wonder where are they going with these increasingly difficult photo shoots it's as if they were competing with fear factor shoots that look like re enactments of fight scenes in crouching tiger hidden dragon shoots where the models have to pose underwater or in almost impossible situations what's next posing while tied to train tracks as an oncoming roars upon them at 70 miles an hour or a shoot where they are underwater chained trying to set themselves free in record time while at the same time looking smashing in chiffon and never ever forgetting to smile their pearly whites at that camera how about a pit and the pendulum version of a photo shoot br br in one thing the show has to be given some kudos and it's in a way akin to american idol with this i'm probably going to justify the harshness of both shows and its abrasive judges and essentially go against my initial paragraph america's next top model is a show that is an extended audition like american idol and in it the girls will get the sort of test treatment they will receive in the real world where prospective designers and photographers as monstrously fickle as they can be will crush them to bits at the drop of a hat if they can't sell themselves the way they're expected to and where one is asked to leave another will supplant her with the necessary requirements which makes it a wonder that any girl would want to get into such a difficult media but that's what dreams are made of br br going into its fifth season it's been a major disappointment with the departure of janice dickinson during her run she was a pretty tough barometer as to how the girls should walk talk emote express themselves and ultimately present themselves as a walking living product that sells with the cold addition of twiggy i wonder where it will go from here twiggy just can't replace the over the top temperament of dickinson so with janice's absence the show has lost some of its edge and may even have signaled its slow demise but in the meantime it's still a catchy pleasure to watch mindless entertainment on if at all for the gorgeous visuals if at all it's the show that launched adrienne curry into the spotlight curry has made a name for herself due to facts that have less to do with modeling as much as her love affair with one time child actor christopher knight in their very own reality soap opera
<START> this is one of my favorite capra esque comedies this movie is just meant to be enjoyed not deconstructed microscopically analyzed it's not religious commentary it's fun it's fantasy the surprisingly negative comments imho reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think must be a part of every movie br br others have described travolta's role it's the reason you'll watch the movie over and over and the excellent supporting cast including sparky br br sometimes a cigar is just a cigar sometimes a movie is just fun br br enjoy
<START> spoiler nothing but spoiler br br i have to add my name to the list of folks who feel that the other viewers just don't get it but no one has even mentioned the s word so far as i have seen br br while i agree that the kid died i think we can be more specific he committed suicide he races down the slope in an old wagon shoots off the cliff and flies away maybe the whole account of the form of death is allegory or maybe he does commit suicide in a wagon as laid out in either case he flies away c'mon not that tough a metaphor br br maybe i just have a thing for tom hanks but i was ok with the narration besides he is raising for the ww2 memorial and you gotta love him for that br br oh yeah i loved the movie and found it incredibly moving
<START> picture the scene a bored student with an empty day ahead a video shop with a special offer of 5 video for a week rentals this ex student usually just grabbed a pile of videos of dubious quality for the most arbitrary of reasons the turning anybody occasionally the odd undiscovered gem did make it into his vcr this being the case with this film everything about the film is good but much more than this the parts all mesh to provide something all too rare a cracking good film why this never got a uk cinema release is beyond me especially when we consider the crap that we have to wade through at the multiplex week on week whilst i'll happily accept this isn't oscar material but neither was sodding titanic schmaltzy cgi tinged bollocks it is a an extremely enjoyable film i was trying to think of a way to describe how best this film should be appreciated accepted the perfect film to watch while bonding with your dad after a coming home for the holidays after a large sunday lunch
<START> this movie is simply bad first of all the story is just weird and it's not good written it leaves you with questions when you're finished sometimes that's ok but not in this case br br the acting is nothing to write home about the adults does a ok job but the kids taken in consideration they are kids does not a good job i thought the lead role ian costello as mickey was worst well to be honest i'm not sure that was the lead role never quite figured who this movie was about mickey or pete br br there were some shots that stood out but over all there were nothing exiting about the cinematography the sound however was better there was a nice score a little adventure kind of score though this didn't look like an adventure film to me it had some elements of an adventure film but it was more of a drama however it was hard to tell who this film was meant for children hardly there is too much language and violence for that adults i don't know it had to many elements of a children's movie in it it was like a adult movie in a children movie wrapping br br the story was just weird i don't have much of an idea of what it really was about you was thrown right in to it without knowing anything but there were all the time references to something you felt you should know the fact that the children's parents were dead for instance and that mickey blamed pete for it you expected to get to know what happened but you never got br br all together this movie was bad and a waste of time there was no drive in it nothing to really move the story forward this is not what you spend your saturday night on
<START> kirk and the crew are visiting a federation mining colony on a remote planet rich in mineral resources the devil in the dark is the a very unusual silicon based life form which tunnels through solid rock the has been killing miners and it is decided must be destroyed but how br br it is hard to continue this review without writing a spoiler so instead i simply concentrate on the technical aspects of the episode and touch on its themes the special effects are ok but many of the scenes with the look a little absurd the acting is fairly average for tos some of the miners are a little awkward nimoy has the most difficult role of all in devil in the dark and he pulls it off well br br why is this still a favorite of mine br br devil in the dark is really an anthropological and ecological morality play disguised as an adventure more than many episodes of this great tv series it brings home the importance of maintaining an open mind and at least some degree of empathy toward others plus it involves one of the most interesting if not probable plot twists in the original series br br enjoy
<START> i know a lot of people like this show and i apologise to people who think this show is awesome but it is the worst show ever created sure i'm sure i would be a big fan of this show if jeremy clarkson wasn't on it i mean i think that testing out cars and doing things like seeing whether a car can beat a aeroplane is awesome but jeremy clarkson is just pathetic here are the reasons i hate this man he thinks it's cool to trick speed cameras that measure your average speed by taking measuring your distance and time by driving down the road and then resting for two hours he clearly thinks that he is better than richard hammond and james may he's got my best friend saying pathetic things he screams at kids just for taking a picture of him i'm sorry top gear but jeremy clarkson is a freak
<START> yes lifetime has a habit of making the male species look stupid and this soap opera ain't kidding when they make perry king supposedly a well renowned medical doctor unable to see the evil surrounding him puts your trust in doctors huh how can anyone not see what's going on is he that stupid and the evil wife with a face like a horse goes around killing off his entire family without a trace how does she acquire all the drugs that isn't explained how does she get off being a secretary in a hospital without any credentials i guess the director don asks us to just believe it i didn't i kept yelling at the screen at the stupidity of king with all right in front of his face if the wife was that attractive maybe just maybe i'd accept it but she's not even that shannon sturges is the perfect wife and i tell you she has the face of a horse i wouldn't cross the street for her yet our perfect husband does and quickly after everybody in the cast get knocked off i wasn't satisfied with the come up pence given to our villainess she deserved more than she got william moses plays the doctor's brother who unfortunately you know his outcome from day one pleasure to at least see one pretty face in this clinker that of lesley anne down she gives the film a 2 count just on the relief of seeing someone fetching in this mess perry king deserved his fate what a jerk
<START> i cannot see why anyone would make such a movie from start to finish this film is really really bad br br the characters are all very shallow terribly acted and downright annoying there is absolutely nothing going on below the surface at all with either characters or plot br br the 'humour' if you can call it that is aimed at an adult audience i presume from the language and nudity although it comes across as mainly toilet humour and would have problems even drawing a smile from a half witted 16 year old br br i would recommend avoiding this excuse for a comedy it has nothing whatsoever that would appeal to a film fan non existent laughs and a plot that barely exists lead me to ask why has this film been made why why why br br i expect in the fullness of time to see this film topping the top 100 worst films
<START> watching death bed the bed that eats is like waking up in the hospital two days into a suicide br br watch disorienting but oddly stimulating there are few cinematic equivalents to this disturbing yet often humorous lesson in mythology morality and surrealist ideology br br cocteau's blood of a poet and maya br br experimental works evoke a taste of the strange atmosphere found in death bed a close comparison are the dark adult fairy tales by literary genius author angela carter the short disturbing stories of br br or e t a hoffman br br death bed has many recognizable elements of the br br past but displays a wholly unique and original storyline br br as a story death bed is an amazingly simple yet original br br vision something which only one in a thousand independent releases will manage to accomplish this unassuming film has its technical flaws but overcomes them all with a cast of beautiful non actors br br and lost creepy locations a true 1970s independent classic br br death bed also displays a unique subversive 3 dimensional personality a deep and continuous layering of dream images and ideas that lend it a fun house type of construct the passage of time told in flashbacks and historic time travelogues the bed with its sinister black humor the rich yet understated symbolism used within its imagery most pleasing is the image of aubrey the suffering artist forever trapped inside the frame of his own painting as he comments on and fondles with the murdered victim offerings gifted to him as love offerings by the demented spirit a sick refrain and wonderful element metaphor for the trapped artist nothing but the weirdest in poe or can equal that br br anyone who values the spirit of independent cinema and craves the multi layered symbolist experience or craves the surrealist concept of convulsive br br beauty and the gothic horror leanings of low budget exploitation film making will dig this totally unique vision a simple and fun film with deliciously deep psychic undercurrents highly recommended
<START> i saw this film on at the cambridge film festival br br the beagle's only in a couple of short flashbacks the whole thing is about darwin's life from to 1859 when he was ensconced in kent with his growing family 200 pages of origin had already been drafted and he was wondering whether to complete the book br br the script is based on book annie's box annie charles's daughter died when she was 10 it is mostly a family drama but does include sex scenes however the participants are married both on and off screen not too exciting not much science but a well made film that's pleasant to watch and pushes the right emotional buttons a bit of a romantic weepie actually i suppose the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic free thinking scientist from an atheist family background and still be an emotional romantic as well as an excellent father br br some of the characters and darwin himself state or wonder whether he killed god but the viewer is able to doubt that what is beyond doubt given the deadly struggle for survival and the web of predation on the meadow bank well known before darwin and completely and the failure of darwin's prayers is that the idea of a kind god who loves his creatures is untenable br br i really cannot see many americans to it very much some may have problems with the title which is probably the most controversial thing about the film or with the fact that bettany does not have horns a tail and a pitchfork
<START> well the name in the summary should tell you everything fred olen ray the modern king of low budget flicks be it for tv or direct to video i doubt he produces for the silver screen anymore with the death of drive in b movie double features and all br br creator of such cult classics like hollywood chainsaw hookers and dinosaur island br br well i kind of like this guys stuff its mostly entertaining in a distinctly cheesy campy and especially cheap kind of way and if he's one thing he's a pro something you can't say for all guys in the movie biz br br but this one flick here is among the weaker ones in his insipid acting an uninspired script and lame jokes conspire to make your brain go numb in a matter of minutes if you are out for real f o r goodness or rather badness look out for the above mentioned ones and generally his stuff from the 70s and 80s i think he lost a bit of his edge lately
<START> having just watched this with my mother who got it for christmas i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch all of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning every storyline is followed through brilliantly making you feel completely different things for every single character the cast is amazing my personal favourites being james read and lesley anne down as george hazard and madeline main the whole thing is in depth and wonderful making very compulsive viewing i recommend it to almost everyone
