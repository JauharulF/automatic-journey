<START> oh boy it was just a dream what a great idea mr lynch is very lucky most people try to tell classical stories this way he can play with his little and his even more little payoffs check out polanski's the lodger for far more intelligent mix of fantasy and reality
<START> if you can get past the slow start and bad acting it's worth watching the story line was pretty decent the father had a wicked temper because he was unemployed and he hardly got to see his kid except in the summer because his ex wife had custody of him the father was very angry and frustrated the majority of the time the monster in the story wasn't too scary the movie breaks consistency of the monster being so incredibly strong the one scene that the moviemakers do this in is one of the times when the kid is down in the cellar and the monster goes to attack him when the monster goes to attack the kid his arm gets caught in a steel trap attached to a chain the monster is about a foot away from the kid's face every other time throughout the movie the monster is strong enough to break through or tear down anything yet the steel trap and chain holds him back from getting the kid more than likely the moviemakers did this for shock factor because no one wants to see one of the main characters die moviemakers just wanted to scare us into thinking it may be a possibility that the kid could die instead of breaking consistency the moviemakers should have replaced the kid with someone who they could dispose of
<START> adored by fans for his unusually charming creativity and by hollywood for his softball user friendly movie making techniques tim burton tipped the scales too far in favor with his new upset of a cinematic legend sleepy hollow following the quest of crane Â played by johnny depp delivering this dreary film's only shining point Â to the heart of the mystery surrounding a town's seemingly random and gruesome murders by a fabled headless horseman the story plays out as if it were purposely trying to be repugnantly predictable contrived as a children's bedtime story humdrum character introduction is laced with intended upon exciting non engaging chase scenes which with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives produce about as much fright and thrill as the nightmare before christmas br br toss in an endless bundle of old trees for ambience and a wide eyed big busted blonde love interest christina and burton has himself a movie that takes the age old legend of sleepy hollow and succeeded in making it like a disney movie without the charm or dialog was choppy and ridiculous severed heads were aplenty and there were enough plot revealing monologues to embarrass the likes of james bond even with the backing of emmanuel the most sought after cinematographer in hollywood today the wonderful acting of depp and burton's astounding name recognition sleepy hollow is nothing to lose your head over
<START> the scariest thing about this horror movie is that the end alludes to a sequel 'the cave' is really a disappointing action movie a team of cave and undersea researchers go to romania one of these inexpensive places to make a movie for now at least and following a destroyed church enter in a cave that proves to be a realm of underground monsters or are they the movie never decides if it wants to be action science fiction or horror it is a mix of all without salt or fun and acted in a wooden manner the best thing about the movie is the cinematography but even the dark landscape of the cave becomes soon boring because the film lacks pace and the characters are simply not interesting waste of time
<START> normally i try to avoid barbie films but this one was unmistakably awesome kudos to the graphics and character voice overs it all flowed well this enchanting tale is a great spin off of others but is well worth buying i don't have kids but the kids i babysit including boys find it intriguing and love the extra features on the dvd i honestly don't know why this is rated so low but for kids especially your barbie lovin' 8 year old will love this its not straight forward and predictive like most movies are this childrens film has excellent morals and shows teamwork it has no swearing bits of romance if your old enough to figure it out and beautifully written storyline thats why i am giving it a ten out of ten
<START> nothing special to see here the animation has being outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era this film has an original story but if it doesn't have an original plot or characters so in my opinion it's not worth seeing i'm not saying that the movie was bad it was just a typical anime story and i thought i watched this movie like a thousand times so if you are looking for something original see another thing
<START> please do not waste your time and money with this stinker of a turkey br br this is an over the top melodramatic love story set against the background of new france aka quebec in the 18th century or is it an historical saga of new france with an epic romance thrown in i don't know and at this point i don't care anymore br br there is a rich story to be told out there about the intrepid french adventurers rogues and other assorted characters who settled canada and parts of the us this is not it the characters are total clichÃ©s the story is overblown breathless and devoid of any charm and before long all the viewer wants to do is get the heck out of the theatre have his or her head checked and get hold of his or her anger at being taken in by the hype br br this film was the biggest disappointment of my year in terms of cinema especially since as an historian and a french canadian or canadian of french descent or whatever i am a a believer in the fact that the story of my people in this country has yet to be told as well as it could on film b interested in this subject c a film lover who thinks cinema these days could do wonders with this grandiose and tragic story br br as i said do not waste your time with this frustrating bit of claptrap
<START> i honestly can't believe that this film isn't more highly rated claude chabrol could be described as something like a french alfred hitchcock and while this film is only the second one of his that i've seen the first being le i can already see that this guy is something special just on the strength of these two films the film is a french and canadian co production and takes place in canada the cast is made up of british and canadian stars and the high quality performances bode well with the rest of the film most of which is high quality also the film is a murder mystery and begins when a young girl covered in blood is brought into a police station after being questioned by inspector it emerges that the young girl patricia and her sister muriel were attacked by a man who killed the sister and only just allowed patricia to flee however as the investigation goes on patricia goes back to the station to give new evidence which reveals a far more shocking identity to the murderer br br the performances in this film are excellent donald sutherland is subdued as usual but he suits the role he's given here very well and i wouldn't hesitate to name his performance in blood relatives as one of his very best the film also features supporting turns from british stars donald pleasance and david hemmings who both give good turns pleasance in particular who shows just how great an actor he can be and highlights what a shame it is that he went on to waste himself in halloween films the unknown landry also gives a great performance in her role as patricia the movie is very mysterious for the first hour and really keeps the audience hooked when inspector discovers muriel's diary the film turns into more of a drama in which the girl's last actions are shown and while this section of the film is not as good as what went before it it's still interesting and leads into a great twist at the end overall blood relatives is a great film that really deserves to be better seen le is a better known effort from chabrol but for my money this is at least as good highly recommended viewing
<START> frankly i did not think there was anything humorous about this movie it was really lame and poorly done with no plot whatsoever surprisingly it got some chuckles from me at the beginning with the malcolm x terminal and that was about it seriously soul plane made even the worst movies such as gigli look like a emmy winner this movie is really not worth seeing unless of course you were blind like johnny witherspoon who played the blind man in the movie another sad character i cringed at majority of the stereotypic jokes and ruining tom arnold and d l by casting them in this movie this movie could be summarized in just one sentence wins 100 000 000 and creates his own airline sex drugs homosexuality more sex drugs did i mention sex if i could i would rate this movie in the negative however the beginning was amusing which brings this movie to a 1 10 doing the t bag pfft
<START> this is a fine under rated film and rip torn well known as he is is a seriously under rated actor i read howard frank novel many years ago how well craven captures the book and the beauty of vermont's northeast kingdom i had the good fortune to grow up in vt in the 40s and 50s and was still living there when the incident took place i've not seen stranger in the kingdom the craven collaboration based on the incident and another novel but this film has inspired me to track it down
<START> well some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin kicking some ass if that's what you want and you wear a cloak file your teeth to points and think that the name lilith silver is cool you'll see a fine film br br if like most people an assassin dressed in gleaming creaking rubber with huge cleavage thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh then this is one of the best comedies you'll see i laughed so hard i nearly cried ridiculous acting dialogue and plotting help to make this a better spoof than dracula dead and loving it could be br br it tries to be cool and goth and all it succeeds in doing is making each scene hilarious even the tacked on lesbian scene is funny how did she get those boots off that quickly they were laced up to here br br don't see it if you like good films see it if you like terrible films and want to laugh until you fall over it isn't good it's just bad
<START> this documentary is not only one of the best documentaries i've seen but also one of the most moving and quietly beautiful movies i've seen period it follows the lives of two young men peter and as they try to make their way into the american culture peter and are friends at first but they gradually drift more and more apart as peter goes to kansas city and stays in houston a land called houston beauty is in his eyes he takes people onto his back he supports an apartment full of other paying the rent doing everything for other people he is a quiet sufferer peter looks out for himself getting a high school education while playing basketball and making christian friends it seems that director megan did not know what she was getting herself into with the beauty of this tale peter and are amazing characters that move you but the real strength in this movie lies in its commentary on american society it is not judging it shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world and how difficult it can be to outside people i suggest you find this film and look at america through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people br br my grade 10 10
<START> seriously if this had been the first shack movie it would have been passable as funny silly and goofy light satire commentary on the class system would make this an enjoyable late night rental br br however everyone wants to compare it to the first film and maybe that's not fair the first film is a cult classic what could possibly follow it up nothing so take this second film as a stand alone and it certainly has its moments br br jackie mason is amusing doing his best rodney wannabe impersonation is he as good as rodney no are his lines as good no but he is funny the rest of the cast falls in line as being decent but not outstanding you'll recognize faces amongst the cast and wonder how they got to where they are today br br the film is predictable but aren't most in this genre again it's not the best comedy you'll see but if you like cannonball run type fun you'll enjoy this one
<START> this movie is a hard to find gem it is the story of juliette a perfectly ordinary cleaning woman who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company and the president of same he takes no notice of her he takes no notice of anyone until several plots to wrest his company away from him all hit at the same time he is lost no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers juliette as the cleaning woman no one pays any attention to her so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to catch on to and use to help her helpless and hapless boss the complications are wild she is not so ordinary as she seems with five children from five different ex husbands who are all still madly in love with her and he is not so shrewd as he thinks he is this movie doesn't follow a predictable path and that's what keeps you watching the acting is superb and there are some very moving moments along the way as well the working class displays more savvy than those above them almost in the same way gosford park showed the upper crust is not all it's cracked up to be mentally i recommend this movie very much see it 9 10
<START> if there's one cartoon that helped to put upa on the map more than any other it's gerald this tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years besides the effects loved the music the abstract animation and backgrounds the narration by marvin miller pretty much everything and it won the oscar for best animated short of 1950 glad to have seen it on youtube after reading about this dr seuss story for so many years and rocky and bullwinkle creator bill scott also contributed how awesome hope to see the subsequent shorts made in the series if not on youtube then maybe in a dvd collection now i guess i'll watch another upa short there
