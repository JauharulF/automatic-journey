<START> ok well i guess it was worth my time sitting through this once but i won't be watching it again there are several things about this film that irritated me br br first man i really hated the characters i had the same problem with sid and nancy i have a hard time spending a fair chunk of time following characters who i really don't care about and can't relate to it's not that the actors or the writing were technically bad it was that the characters were written in such a way that i just had contempt for them and as the movie went on i almost wanted to see the sky fall on them and this leads me to the second problem and a question which i think is at the heart of this movie was the intent to simply document this generation and these types of bohemians who were i guess wandering around europe in the 60s was the intent to criticize and lambaste them or was this film some kind of a warning my final assessment of the film that is to say in determining if there was anything salvageable here at all hinges on this question br br regardless these characters are really unlikeable and as a consequence it's hard to really give a crap about the plot or what happens to them if this was some sort of statement on this generation then the film becomes a little more tolerable it is clear that schroeder is not some kind of geriatric establishment square so the way he proceeds here carries more weight than say the countless stupid aip films set in or concerning the 60s counterculture br br at bare minimum this film has two things going for it first the soundtrack obviously i like how is used here and others have mentioned it too as it takes the forefront in the movie i am guessing that if you are a pink floyd fan and want to see it for that reason nothing you read here is likely to stop you from watching it anyway it wouldn't stop me either the curiosity of hearing pink floyd in a movie may be enough to just barely get you through this br br secondly there is some nice scenery ibiza looks like a nice place to visit maybe i'm just sick of looking at los angeles new york and chicago in films but european films which take the time to actually show us europe the beautiful or the ugly mostly beautiful here are always welcome br br but i really see no particular genius here no revolutionary camera work not even a moral tone message sensibility or plot that has anything new to say perhaps what was revolutionary about this was merely that it came from a guy like schroeder a film critical of a mindset that at least in part made his movies marketable to that extent it is an honest film there's no glorification of the abject excesses of the 60s here which is perhaps something you might expect in fact the portrayal of the characters in this film closely mirrors the somewhat distorted in my opinion modern cultural memory of that generation br br oh yeah bunch of yawn nudity and sex here nothing new if you watch these kinds of movies from this time period i guess it was considered novel or provocative or something at the time i don't find it offensive or titillating i doubt you will either rather it just extends the running time of an already tedious film in its own way this particular use of sexuality in movies of the time especially european ones has become a bit of a clichÃ© but i guess in hindsight you can't blame them they were just in that decade able to get away with it and i suppose i'm guessing here the very presence of this kind of graphic sexuality was a political or social statement in and of itself that being that sexuality was a part of life that this generation wasn't going to be all weird about like their parents were br br should you watch it if you're a pink floyd fan sure i guess it's worth a watch in any case the valley is a better film i went into this movie expecting largely what i got if you don't normally watch these kinds of arty avant garde films and don't know what to expect this is bound to be annoying as hell this is a normal healthy reaction br br if you're not a pink floyd fan i'm not sure why you'd spend your time here i noticed one fellow who left a comment did enjoy this movie quite a lot so maybe i'm just missing something i don't need guys running in slow motion from fireballs special effects explosions or anything like that to enjoy a movie but i do need some kind of handle i need to find something to like about a movie and generally i need to sympathize with some aspect of the characters' plight barring that some novel film making will work camera work and so forth here there's just nothing to hold on to except for pink floyd's magnificence which is just enough to make this tolerable at bare minimum if you're a pink floyd fan to begin with you'll like the bit with i promise
<START> when this show began it was fairly interesting we got to see what crab boat fisherman had to go through during the crab catching season soon after however it lost focus on the fishing and focused almost entirely on the drama in the lives of the fisherman episodes became nothing more than 'the captain doesn't like the new this one happens way too often 'someone is injured or sick' 'a fisherman gets word of some problem at home and is frustrated that he is stuck on a boat' repeat i don't know how people can find the newest seasons watchable as every episode seems to be essentially the same as those before and after it this show should be moved to a different channel and renamed to crab boat drama or even better it would have made a perfect one time segment on dirtiest jobs br br shouldn't the discovery channel have learned their lesson after american choppers
<START> i rented the matrix revisited with a friend of mine we both loved the matrix and we both love filmmaking so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of the matrix it turns out that the matrix revisited tells you hardly anything about the art of filmmaking or even how the matrix was made it is basically a huge commercial for the matrix a movie that the target audience of the matrix revisited has already seen br br if you really want to know about the process and the troubles and the stress and the detail that went into making of the matrix look no further than the bonus features on the original dvd of the matrix there are things they show in those documentaries that i had not even realized had to be done or was done the matrix was such a difficult and challenging film to make that it deserves more credit than a documentary that's about as informative and interesting as an mtv special
<START> this joins the endless line of corny predictable 50's sci fi shlock out there as usual it's pretty bad there isn't much of a plot that i could detect and the over exaggeration of the leads only adds to the unintentional laughs the title is misleading also catching this on mst3k is probably the only way for it to be viewed and it's better left that way
<START> i watched this movie which i really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel disappointed in the end the problem i think with this film was that the director was trying a bit to hard to make this film weird and original there were too many flashbacks and too many bad effects which got me annoyed through the film i love debbie harry and isaac hayes but they disappointed me in this film they could of done much better this film seemed promising in the beginning dragging in the middle and then disappointing in the end the film could never beat stanley kubrick's when it comes to controversial matters weirdness and originality in movies
<START> now i'm a big fan of zombie movies i admit zombie movies usually aren't all that good but i like them anyways despite the crappy acting and worthless dialogues that occur in almost all zombie movies this one is by far the worst see there are a few ground rules with zombie movies 1 zombies are suicidal tactics is seldom used and never do they act like a boxer they don't dodge a blow to the head they take it with a ugly smile they don't try and hit you in the face they grab a hold of your arm and bite it 2 zombies can't speak only in evil dead otherwise they do not speak 3 you don't fight zombies with melee ranged weapons you loose in a melee fight against zombies firearms are used in this movie however melee is the way to go which is wrong very wrong br br it had no redeeming qualities br br if you wish to see a zombie movie see one with an average score higher than 3 on imdb com
<START> a brilliant film by the great john waters the characters are unforgettable the acting script and camera work only enhance the overall greatness of this film perversion as an art form a must see for all easily a perfect 10
<START> although the wonderful soda counter in the local drugstore no br br longer exists and the clothes are definitely immediate br br post war vintage and good and evil are easy to understand and br br those old planes are really dated this movie will never be dated br br the human adjustments and problems post war the beautiful br br love stories the wonderful acting especially harold russell and br br dana andrews are as moving today in 2002 as they were in br br i was one of the young women who welcomed our marvelous br br veterans home from world war ii like so many my memories of br br the war years and the are as fresh today as if they br br took place yesterday this movie is very relevant for our times
<START> this is an extremely involving series that is well casted and portraits a sensitive subject with great splendor we follow michael as the undercover fbi agent set to infiltrate a terror cell lead by oder the series is very well written and has enough plot twists to keep you sitting at the edge of your seat waiting for whatever happens next br br michael is by my definition one of the best actors i've seen portraying an undercover agent cold on the outside but still a good human being underneath trying his best to keep his head afloat in a highly emotional roller coaster ride that fbi has had him embark on oder on the other hand comes off a guy that pretty much could fit into any social scenario big and strong but yet able to disappear into the gray mass if so needed highly authoritative and extremely cunning the way the two communicate on screen is nothing short of spectacular br br the way the story develops and the level of detail that the script offers makes the whole story extremely believable and also very true to life i would imagine it is of such magnitude that you're left with the feeling of being insecure not knowing what might happen next in real life we read about terror every day and here we are given a good sneak peak into an underworld which most of us know very little about br br it's a series that will for sure have you coming back for more sitting there at the edge of your seat just waiting for next weeks episode to come on it's a sure winner in my eyes and i have no problems stating that this series is on my list of all time best
<START> it's hard to know what to make of this weird little aussie crime flick on the one hand it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour but on the other it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory that being said two hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring the absurdity of the goings on the thick australian accents and the bizarre set of characters all help to ensure that the film entertains also the plot follows the story of a young doorman who thinks he'll go on to bigger things after accepting a job from the local kingpin he doesn't the job only lands him in trouble when he fancies a swim and stupidly leaves ten grand on the beach which is promptly stolen by a couple of kids who have the time of their lives on a shopping spree however all is not rosy for our hero who must find the money or face the consequences br br the film is made up of a cast of unknowns at least it was back in 1999 as nowadays heath ledger is something of a name he doesn't impress too much here however as his performance is mostly of the one note variety and he doesn't make for a very compelling lead he fits the movie in that he's australian and looks naive but beyond that he's not the best lead i've ever seen in a movie if you ask me bryan brown gave the best performance here he might not have a great deal of screen time but he steals every scene he's in and it's him that provides the movie with a lot of its humour he's got nothing to do with the best sequence however which takes place in the form of probably the most hilarious bank robbery ever caught on film on the whole i can recommend this film to people that enjoy quirky crime films as the weirdness is plentiful and the way that events take a turn for the bizarre is enjoyable but if you're not a fan of this sort of film i can't really say that two hands will float your boat it's not a must see but if it's your thing and you get a chance to see it you probably wont completely regret it
<START> a delightful story about two evacuees has been turned into a nice little film by the bbc most children who like a good story will enjoy this the characters are played really well by a very good cast not sure whether our american friends will appreciate it but they do get a mention as aunty lou runs off with a gorgeous american soldier
<START> i had seen this movie just days before halloween 2004 i noticed it around lunch time and it was an interesting description in my menu box so i decided to watch it seriously only a movie only suitable for late night tv you know after conan but before the infomercials sorta deal br br although this movie has very little to do with webs it does have a lot to do with spiders refer to my heading if you need a refresher br br i found the idea behind the story absolutely fascinating a hidden nuclear generator a scientist and a believable portal would have been a good start to a cool fantasy but then it goes downhill after 15 20 minutes br br the cast is poor with no memorable performances poor quality queen who has had her breasts amplified considering spiders don't carry breasts as well as poor sound effects an obvious low budget movie though the cast has tried br br spoiler br br 4 electricians stumble upon a hidden nuclear generator while on a job they fiddle with the buttons and open a portal 2 workers fall into the portal and it closes scrambling to figure out what is going on the party still in our world seeks help while the other party observers their surroundings br br help does not arrive so they open the portal and follow through meeting up in a parallel dimension they encounter a race of human spiders dubbed soldiers after a death and chase they are saved by survivors br br now it gets boring they hide talk a bit try to build another portal then attack the hive after losing 2 more electricians they open the portal and escape returning to our world some 200 million years ago br br sounds interesting huh
<START> well i've just seen buster keaton's film debut in fatty arbuckle's the butcher boy and despite the crude way everything just seems to happen for almost no logical reason i found plenty to laugh at like when buster orders molasses from butcher boy fatty fatty makes buster come back to pay buster says he put it in the bucket that has the molasses fatty dumps molasses in buster's hat and takes money buster takes hat back on head as it gets stuck fatty attempts to remove it while molasses fall to floor buster's feet are now stuck on floor and so on that probably didn't read funny but on screen it was hilarious as were some more slapstick involving flour being thrown and a later sequence that takes place in fatty's girlfriend's boarding school with fatty dressed in drag and buster helping fatty's rival also in drag like i said many scenes don't make a lick of sense but the visuals especially those involving arbuckle and keaton are laugh inducing even today recommended viewing for keaton completists
<START> i was aware of man of the year's critical pans and unremarkable gross but was prepared to give the film the benefit of the doubt because i know good pictures can fall under the radar during the crowded release schedule of the fall months br br what i found out was that the movie is surprisingly uninspired surprising is an understatement considering barry levinson's gift for political satire demonstrated in good morning vietnam and wag the dog and robin williams' obvious comic gifts robin williams in fact is mysteriously underused on the making of featurette that comes with the dvd barry levinson talked about how sometimes he let robin williams improvise off the script like it was some naughty secret of his you really that much of a moron barry levinson whenever you have robin williams in your film and want to use him for his comic abilities basically every movie he's been in other than insomnia or one hour photo don't cage him within a script let him ad lib whatever he wants because he is the funnier than anything anyone else can write for him and his comic rants can instantly raise the bar on any mediocre movie like rv or patch adams what i found even more baffling in his failure to make use of robin williams was that back in 1987 levinson used this exact formula to perfection in good morning vietnam injecting robin williams' bursts of comic zaniness into a war picture to make a resounding political piece br br so the film isn't as much of a laugh fest as it could be and feels awkwardly lost in its tone if the film had potential to work as anything it might have made one of those thrillers from the mid '90s in the style of the pelican brief the fugitive or one of those jack ryan films its plot centered around an employee at a silicon valley company uncovering a glitch in a system that reveals that the country elected the wrong president and the efforts of the ceos to eliminate her before the secret gets out so if you replaced robin williams with some harrison ford type actor or perhaps even harrison ford himself added a couple more explosions and maybe that's where the movie was trying to go i'll never really know and it's not worth it to try to find out
<START> this film is outstanding on this date of apr 8 2007 it was on on demand from show time it had been a while since i seen it but it does feature thomas jane in the first role i seen him in at first you see a normal guy that seems kind of henpecked with a wife that seems close to going her own way the directors cut which i just watched has a opening scene that is cool is dressed as a cheerleader type looking very fresh and hot trying to buy a coffee late at night with no small bills turns violent in a hurry shows that her name on her letter jacket is the real deal meeting up with his old road pal nick played by aaron was cool at first and he even loans him his wife's car to take care of some business then he spots nicks silver briefcase and the day changes for the weird and violent there is a cast of real characters that parade through the next series of scenes but dallas steals the show i think her telling of a casey story to the doctor that is there to get a personal interview in a adoption application is outrageous as a rule i have never thought tall women were that sexy but as with any rule there are exceptions is as one has never seen her before in films sexy and lethal like in the one movie with tom selleck but with a never seen before malevolence if your looking for film to add to your collection this one is worth the price in the nude is worth the price alone but this story has everything one might hope one has love friendship sex and violence in a terrific mix when i first seen it years ago it blew my mind and i know you will feel the same way
