<START> others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements i think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance the feet the faces the overall view unfortunately it falls a bit short but having said that watching colin dunne is nevertheless gratifying it's an interesting contrast to michael flatley in the original video the progression of the show is evident changes from the original dublin production are evident br br trading taps is the highlight of the video in my opinion winston is unbelievable as is his partner in the piece br br i think the audio was better in this version than the original video production 1995 in dolby 5 1 on dvd it's excellent br br despite the flawed it's a must own for riverdance fans
<START> in new york in a morning close to christmas an upper class father and mother go in their bmw to a private school to see the play of their daughter then they go shopping and later they return to their fancy apartment in manhattan in the night they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood where they prepare drugs for distribution on the christmas eve while buying the christmas gift for their daughter the father is kidnapped and his wife desperately tries to raise a high amount of money to pay the requested ransom r xmas is a deceptive movie of abel ferrara the lead characters do not have names are anonymous and maybe his intention is to tell that in the breast of a neighbor family in your building may have drug dealers or that drug dealers may also have families and may be loving persons or that there are many dirty cops probably worse than the criminals or is it a simple apology to crime whatever however this humanization of criminals is a horrible message and i really did not like this movie in brazil for example many drug dealers and criminals help their communities due to the absence of the state in poor areas and slums but this procedure does not make them model citizen in this movie we see a loving upper class family in the day providing drugs as means of living but the destruction of the members of other families is not shown in the story and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any characters in the end i wished all of them dead my vote is four br br title brazil do gangs of the ghetto
<START> i have no idea how anyone can give this movie high marks i didn't rent it thinking it was the next great horror flick the next great horror spoof or the next great low budget horror spoof obviously this isn't meant to scare but one fatal flaw with the production entirely sapped the joy out of the viewing experience the sound editing was horrible i had to work the volume control the entire movie you can imagine how difficult it is to get into something even a low budget spoof when you're either turning the volume up or down or trying to anticipate the next time you have to do so the regular dialogue is very low and all screams noises etc are very loud we're not talking about between 5 and 7 on the volume control finding a happy medium at 6 we're talking between 2 and 9 on the volume where it is virtually impossible to leave the volume alone again this movie might be a decent example of what it is meant to be but you're going to be spending so much time adjusting your volume control that you'll never have the chance to enjoy it
<START> slick tidy and well made old school version of how a great international thriller should be made determined to nail a feared global terrorist who is known as carlos the jack shaw donald sutherland without limits space cowboys a cia operative and his israeli counterpart amos ben kingsley gandhi sexy beast get a noble naval officer ramirez aidan quinn music of the heart to become carlos and use him in a daring plot to get the kgb to kill the real carlos because he took an offer from the cia sutherland and kingsley are both good here but the movie really belongs to quinn here who embodies himself here in a dual role director christian duguay and cinematographer david franco provide another great asset of the film here with hitchcockian like suspense and great sights of the world
<START> i saw farewell to harry at the plaza theatre while in new york city and was quite taken the performance of william hall jr is tremendous this is a movie for the classic movie goer garrett bennett's direction reminds me of early barry levinson and robert redford's work the movie seems to transcend the typical independent film it has a soul and a visual power that is quite unique i saw this with a small audience 400 who were captivated from the moment of the first credit to the last and although i wasn't out and out crying like the lady next to me i do have to admit i had a little watering in the eyes br br
<START> burt kennedy both wrote directed this western taken from a novel kennedy was a well known good writer director mostly westerns br br robert mitchum was a star for over 20 years when he made this this role was like many he had made already one can see why he was a big star for so many years br br he filled this role easily like a well used glove br br the title character is played by robert walker jr his father a fine actor robert walker died tragically at age 32 his mother is noted actress jennifer jones br br robert was of slight build even though he had talent only made a few films he was in rita hayworth's near last film br br road to the same year was very good br br he looked very much like his father but seemed to lack his fathers charm he made only a few more movies he is still living i wish him well br br most of his scenes are with another son of a hollywood great john carradine's son david who is still making movies they made a nice team br br in westerns you always have a female character usually she is a dance hall performer today they call them hookers angie dickinson assays this role nicely also featured are western stalwarts john anderson jack kelly br br it was film in old tucson outside of downtown az the scenery is gorgeous br br typical of the older westerns there is not too much action there is some good humour the usual ending shoot out br br it is a fast enjoyable 89 minutes br br ratings out of 10 84 points out of 100 imdb 7 out of 10
<START> this isn't among my favorite hitchcock films though i must admit it's still pretty good among the things i really liked were the presence of jimmy stewart he always improves even the most mediocre material and the incredibly scary looking assassin who looks like a skeleton with just a thin layer of skin stretched over him although it cost the studio a lot of money i didn't particularly care for doris day in the film she seemed to weep a lot and belts out que sera like a yes i know that she was supposed to sing in that manner but this forever made me hate this song sorry br br the other complaint though minor i had about the movie was that it was a little too polished and hollywood esque the original version also done by hitchcock just seemed a lot grittier and seedier and this added to the scary ambiance
<START> this movie sucks it's horrible if anyone liked it those people should get there heads examined jackie mason's character sounds like a retard that guy who tries to kill the gopher is a loser and he sucked even though chevy chase was in this movie he wasn't funny this movie had crude and unfunny jokes and did not have rodney dangerfield ted knight and bill murray even though jackie mason's character had the personality of rodney dangerfield's character mason's character sucks rodney dangerfield was funny he should have returned i don't care about ted knight but bill murray should have returned also the original caddyshack was murray's career performance if he was funny in the first he could have been funny in the second br br final comment i recommend this movie to no one this movie sucked it has sucked it sucks now and it will always suck br br 2 10
<START> if this was the best dutch cinema had to offer these years my worst fears have come true i have never even in dutch movies seen worse acting i couldn't get myself to watch it for more than 40 minutes so if that's the cause of me missing the genius so be it br br
<START> can i just start by saying i'm a fan of bad movies and this is a really bad movie it states on the front 100 passengers 3000 snakes but i think it's more accurate to say 12 passengers and about 20 snakes br br the snakes don't do anything particularly interesting the whole movie in fact just blunders on with little happening although there is occasionally a great gore shot of pulsating arms and green goo puke bad movies have to have green goo don't they br br but then the ending comes along and will quite literally smack you off you seat in hysteria and for that this movie gets a boost up to a 2 rating br br there are certain movies about in the world that you will want to show to your friends just so you can watch there reaction when a certain event happens in them br br for example the arrival of 'big man' in r kelly's in the closet' 'the line' in attack 3' you'll know it when you hear it the arrival of the mama shark in attack 3' almost every scene of 'troll 2' the ending of 3000' just for utter disbelief and confusion and the end of this movie proudly sits in this category it's worth sitting through just for that so get drunk stoned whatever your poison is and watch this movie with some mates br br quite simply if you like bad movies get this but don't get it confused with 'snakes on a plane' there's no relation br br and don't pay more than a fiver for it either
<START> i never heard of mishima before i watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious i still find myself drawn to watch it when it is repeated on the box at the beginning of the film we are told about a celebrated japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku in public as the film progresses you are gently inducted into twisted logic of mind the stages of his life are are presented in four chapters each chapter itself is a blend of two contrasting narratives the first continues the story with scenes from life and appear in black and white the second narrative is an adaptation of scenes from a novel and these are staged like a play and filmed in vivid colours there is a different novel staged in each chapter between each chapter the narrative returns to the present as mishima proceeds towards his eventual ritual suicide this means that the drama and tension is maintained until the end br br i suspect that many people will find this film to be boring pretentious and art house i respect that this is not a film for people who want action and a strong story line if on the other hand you are the kind of person who relishes the opportunity to penetrate the mind a bizarre man while watching his life story told in collage of beautiful pictures set to music by philip glass you will love it i loved it br br
<START> crackerjack is a funny movie everyone at the has seen it and all say the same the wheel of cheese was a great part of the movie also the loud speaker dear mr so and so you have left you right indicator on or when jack goes home and lays down on the couch and cracks a beer bowls is hard work cracked me up and when his roommate shows interest by joining the club and calling bingo number jack buying all the tickets to win the meat tray bloody great movie if you are into lawn bowls as you can relate to it if your not a lawn bowler forget it i think the evans head would rate as the best club in aus friendly people great company hi to evans head steve
<START> you can't help but marvel at hitchcock's early work saboteur for example is so slick and quick that it's hard to believe he made this film over 60 years ago there's some propaganda elements but they're woven into the mystery so well that the thing plays beautifully years later you also get some previews of stuff that hitchcock would do later like using a national landmark as a backdrop this time it's the statue of liberty in north by northwest of course it's mt rushmore you'll also recognize things that pop up later in rear window and vertigo in saboteur but let's not give away the show robert cummings is excellent as is the oh so charming otto kruger look for hitchcock's mini western in this one it happens quickly so don't blink
<START> this movie and its subsequent tv series followup has become the iconic stand in for what is great about america br br fame is famous for its music and performances there are several standouts including irene cara paul anne meara and the superb gene anthony ray the latter who plays a walk on dancer with no academic or other than street credentials is an amazing personality and is worth watching for what is essentially a portrayal of himself a wonderment to behold as one king was apt to say br br the plot follows an interesting format chronological at times genre at other times personalities in some cases but it all really ends in a kind of mush br br where parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive with the extremely poignant and sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score that matches the performers step for step br br the climax of the film is a climax for all times and this climatic complete cast of many many talented musicians and dancers and music is thankfully repeated throughout the credits these are one set of credits that are well worth sitting through an achievement for the ages the music by christopher gore is a gift to behold
<START> saboteur was one of the few hitchcocks i had yet to discover and i was less than half overwhelmed the french title la i e the fifth column a very evocative phrase for underground spying and sabotage organizations set my expectations quite high as did the images of the finale on top of the statue of liberty br br basically saboteur is as much light hearted as were the 39 steps note this is another evocative phrase even mcguffin as a title but it lacks most of the humor so the characters are rather down to earth and it's definitely not as fast paced as a chase movie across the usa from la to ny saboteur drags its feet from sequence to sequence the sequence at the villain's lovely ranch lovely ranch lovely villain but pretty tame on the whole it doesn't really add up to nothing the meeting with the blind man the mixing with circus people the soda city sequence the ny ball sequence they fall flat bringing in more characters with very little added suspense value br br one big problem i can point out is the relationship between the leads robert cummings and priscilla lane which is not building up as with robert and madeleine caroll in the 39 steps hence the whole narrative structure is floating depending on the addition of new scenes and new scenes only bring us nearer the end since it's not clear if the hook is the hero's escape from the police from the villains or his action to stop the plotted sabotages in the 39 steps it was clearly scripted as 1 escaping from the police so you know the hero can't just go to the police then 2 running for his life and after the villains to prove his innocence br br if you want a better hitchcock from the 40s wartime propaganda i would advise you to chose foreign over saboteur they are both chase movies with a catchy finale well really a gripping one and not just sightseeing in foreign as well as beautifully efficient scenes the umbrella crowd the tulip fields the strange mills
