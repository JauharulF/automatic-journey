<START> set in 1976 for no apparent reason other than to keep the set dressers busy 'the box' was directed by richard kelly and stars cameron diaz and james marsden as norma and arthur lewis a young couple who are supposedly struggling financially even though they both have successful careers she as a high school teacher he as an optical specialist at langley virginia research center they have one child walter sam oz stone br br one day the find a parcel on their doorstep containing a black box with a big red button there is a note from a 'mr steward' indicating that he will return at 5 00 pm to explain about the box br br the mysterious arlington steward played by frank langella shows up at the appointed time attired in an elegant row suit he is polite but businesslike however his most noticeable feature is his face half of which appears to have been blown off and improperly attended to langella is the only thing worth watching in the movie however he is unfortunately upstaged by his own makeup which resembles that of harvey 'two face' dent aaron from christopher nolan's 'the dark knight ' it's like the elephant in the room one can try to ignore it but it's more than a little distracting br br steward explains that he will return in 24 hours to collect the button if during that time they decide to unlock and push the button he will give them 1 million cash the only catch and it's a big one is that somewhere a stranger will die it might be across town it might be on another continent however steward assures them the victim will be someone unknown to them as a show of good faith he leaves them with a crisp 100 bill theirs to keep whether they push the button or not br br arthur and norma are skeptical believing the whole thing to be a scam or an elaborate hoax however it isn't long before they begin to wonder what would happen if they did push the button would they really get a million dollars would somebody really die weary of the speculation norma slaps the button nothing happens however their initial relief gives way to alarm when steward shows up the next day with a briefcase full of cash they decide to call the whole thing off however steward tells them it's too late you've already pushed the button he explains as steward's limo pulls away arthur notes the license number which he later discovers is registered to the nsa national security agency br br at this point the film begins to veer deeply into territory as the secondary characters start springing nosebleeds and flashing peace signs meanwhile the town becomes invaded by pudgy slack jawed geeks in bad shirts who start following arthur around like an advance scouting party for a race of zombie alien nerds arthur eventually becomes trapped by the menacing in the library where steward's spinsterish wife shows up whom we haven't seen till now and informs arthur that in order to get out of the library he must step into one of three vertical columns of cheesy looking digital water effects 'what happens if i choose the wrong one ' arthur asks seeming far less baffled than he ought to be under the circumstances and certainly far less baffled than the audience is by this time 'eternal damnation ' the spinster says ominously br br arthur steps into the middle column of digital liquid effects and after a brief absence suddenly appears still in his water cocoon hovering over bed when she wakes up and sees him the water bubble bursts and arthur tumbles onto the bed in a shower of water which oddly enough continues to drip from the overhead water pipes just out of camera range while a sodden marsden and diaz flop around on the bed br br it's confusing i know br br we eventually learn that steward was once the public relations officer for the nsa until he was struck by a lightning bolt that destroyed part of his face he was pronounced dead but later came back to life having been transformed into a sort of superman who now serves 'the ones who make the lightning ' and whose powers have enabled him to take over the cia the nsa and nasa all by himself br br and what is the point of all this rubbish apparently steward's mission is to subject humans to a kind of biblical character test e g the of to determine whether humanity is worth saving if enough people pass the button test by refusing to push it steward's god like overlords will spare the race unfortunately those people who do push the button such as norma and arthur must be punished for their moral spinelessness to which end they are subjected to a series of dreary 'lady or the tiger' ordeals that play out like one of those 'saw movies ' except without the entertaining gore or the benefit of a coherent plot br br 'the box' represents the sort of pointless mental masturbation that freshman philosophy students like to blather on about after a few beers richard kelly's tedious exercise in existentialist eventually collapses under the weight of its own incomprehensibility the tortured melange of insupportable ideas eventually as with the mixing together of too many colors into a meandering gray goo of a film as insipid as one of those in flight movies the plot of which suffers no more or less from having been interrupted by a leisurely nap br br there is a point in 'the box' where arthur who is a technically minded guy becomes curious about how the button works opening up the unit he is disappointed to find nothing inside br br having seen the box i know exactly how he feels
<START> laura gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to africa for a photo shoot there she is met by a couple and other swinging couples they all stay at this huge very touristy hotel with a gigantic swimming pool one night they have a pool party complete with real live native dancers it's very un politically correct and very kitschy later emanuelle finally has her photo shoot which turns out to be in one of those drive through stay in your car safaris albeit the photography is gorgeous throughout the film emanuelle is going after every man she meets the photography is very well done in this film there are scenes with cascading waterfalls galloping and ancient ruins the film is worth seeing for the soundtrack by nico alone
<START> while it comes no closer to the tarzan of edgar rice burroughs than say the johnny flicks did it does have it's own peculiar and entertaining slant on the story its a well done tarzan movie nice scenery good photography workable continuity and a tarzan yell that echos the one described by burroughs the players all perform well the only bad points i found were i think related it moves slow in places that slow movement makes this picture to long it could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter which i think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot line and the character development but the rest of the film works well enough to carry it over these two rough spots and still leave the viewer satisfied with the flick short version of all the above its a very good tarzan movie
<START> although humphrey bogart got star billing in king of the underworld i'm willing to bet he didn't thank jack warner for it in fact this film was one hollow crown br br king of the underworld was supposedly a remake of the paul muni film dr socrates but given humphrey bogart was in the cast the character is written more like duke in the petrified forest he even has an english writer along in the person of james stephenson br br kay francis and john are a pair of married doctors and pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of bogart's henchmen bogey's a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives 500 00 and there's more where that came from if he plays his cards right who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income br br but when he's killed in a raid on the gang's hideout francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the american medical association no matter how much she protests her innocence it's no good and she and her aunt jessie move to a small town to get away from the notoriety br br of course the notoriety and bogart and an itinerant leslie howard like writer in stephenson all meet up with her again but kay is plucky and resourceful to say the least br br bogart's character was ridiculous no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts he's a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen just for laughs he's concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states and then let's kay francis completely outsmart him hard to believe he was king of anything br br definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars
<START> i loved this movie i'm shocked and disappointed that it never made it to the theaters every story was better than the last much better than the much hyped scream series and i know what you did last summer and way better than the terrible urban legend i'd recommend this film to every horror fan
<START> this could have been good but sadly its too anthony sabato jr has a grudge please i wanted to like it love shark movies someone should have asked my opinion before they wrote this ha ha the shark is cool but the story lacks alot
<START> i've always liked barbara stanwyck who was perhaps the hardest working lead actress of the 30's and 40's although few of her movie roles are memorable today she is remembered most for the tv show the big valley stanwyck worked so much because she was durable it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence br br and so it was for christmas in connecticut a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn't even really about christmas it does however have stanwyck and dennis morgan as well as some supreme character actors including sydney greenstreet and s k so there are plot twists and funny moments which undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than they do today to begin the plot concerns a magazine writer stanwyck who the magazine's readers believe is a domestic goddess married with a child and living on a farm in connecticut but who is really single lives in new york city and knows nothing about cooking or could anyone get away with such a fraud even then apparently and even the owner of the magazine greenstreet is deceived although one would think that he would have long since seen though the deception but the story moves on and stanwyck greenstreet a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship morgan and stanwyck's restaurateur friend s z find themselves spending christmas in connecticut at a farm belonging to stanwyck's boorish boyfriend reginald gardiner you can imagine all the possibilities there are for this as the fraud unwinds as it must gardiner wants stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the rouse but one wonders how she can stand him at all morgan and stanwyck fall for each other but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married regardless they begin what seems to be a make believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing off in a horse drawn sleigh meanwhile the incredibly naive greenstreet character who has seen stanwyck and morgan go off together but still doesn't get it sees one of the neighbors take back a child that has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the cops to report a kidnapping stanwyck and morgan are arrested for stealing the sleigh and the hoax begins to unwind br br at this point the movie is funny as in ridiculous or absurd not funny ha ha and it routinely ends like screwball comedies always did the good guy gets the girl and presumably they live happily ever after br br i watch this movie every year at christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects way it was in 1945 and because of a long held fascination with barbara stanwyck thank goodness it was set at christmas or like 95 percent of stanwyck's movies it would have been long ago forgotten and we would not get to see it each year anew
<START> this has got to be the worse move i've ever seen it was not only boring it was gag me with a spoon dumb where'd ya find the actors on a street corner who did the special effects for god's sakes i could have made a better movie with my cell phone and if that wasn't bad enough you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could see just how stupid the actors are in real life who ever did the makeup for the aliens must have spent 5 at your local used costume store and called it a day and who in the world wrote up the movie description on the back of the dvd case should be shot it's not even 1 8 of what it is described as that description is just to suck people in to buying renting or paying a ticket to see it no wonder there was never a trailer to it ya would have drove them all away br br bad actors 5 br br special effects 5 50 br br fake fire 1 89 cigarette lighter br br time spent watching this movie total waste i should sue ya for my time watching it
<START> i was fortunate enough to record this wonderful drama both parts when it originally aired on masterpiece theatre i loved it but lost it then one day while going through old tapes found it again i recorded it to dvd and watched and wow i still love it the leads are excellent and my only complaint is i wish we had seen more what a man and she's so strong and wonderful living in a time and age where her affliction and how she deals with it is seen as unfortunate and evil even her own brother tells to her face that he doubts that a man will ever have her sigh unfortunately my copy is not the greatest with wear and tear over the years and i too would absolutely love to own this on professional dvd if it ever happens
<START> i thought maybe maybe this could be good an early appearance by the re animator jeffery combs many to old horror movies the troma label on the this movie could be a gem i thought wrong br br is a boring overplayed half assed homage to the fright films of yore the story is an old one young people breaking into a house getting drunk making love and tampering with things that shouldn't be tampered with the oft Â recycled slasher film formula is used here this time with a thought to be dead actor named conrad doing the killing in fact the performance by the actor ferdy mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film he does the snooty dracula style character very well but as for the kids its not so good with combs only having a minimal part br br the film lacks entertainment value and only features one cool character and one or two scenes that can hold your attention i do not recommend this film unless you are desperate for something to watch and this is the only movie left at blockbuster
<START> dean book watchers is one of the finest books i have read sadly the movie is a sad caricature of the book the disillusioned middle aged hero and the lonely spinster with whom he finds a meaning to his life are converted in the movie into a couple of silly teenagers the stoic security agent and the conscientious sheriff are combined into a farcical villain you get the picture the moviemakers have taken a moving tale of love horror and adventure and converted it into a z grade horror flick aimed very poorly at the teen market br br buy the book and enjoy many hours of reading it will be far far more rewarding than watching the movie br br
<START> i was delighted when i saw that my husband rented labyrinth of passion i love almodovar's films we both loved the movie we both couldn't stop laughing we especially enjoyed the scene in which the transvestite is shooting a photo novel and while supposedly being menaced by a killer with an electric drill is told to answer the phone and say i can't talk to you right now i'm being attacked by a sadistic serial killer if i survive i will call you back that would make a great answering machine message come to think of it we also loved the lady telling her new found beloved i went to an orgy after the concert but i couldn't stop thinking of you i'm waiting to use that line on twitter labyrinth of passion is a rollicking farce with plenty of high jinks hilarious dialog and eye candy for everyone the film has aged well the 1980s costumes and hairdos add to the wackiness i would give it a 10 out of 10 rating but i am giving it a 8 for two reasons the first is the scene which involves laxatives which includes a shot of a lady soiling herself totally unnecessary and it brings down the tone of the film to hollywood gross out comedy for a moment the second is the suggestion that is sleeping with her father shocking yes but again it ruins the tone of the film still i would recommend the film to anyone who wants a sophisticated spicy and fun time
<START> ingrid bergman playing dentist walter matthau's faithful receptionist who harbors a little crush on her boss is absolutely wonderful in this film she handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and goldie hawn talk in a record booth ingrid's monologue is a front but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart matthau is an odd choice for the leading man he's too old for goldie hawn and too unrefined for bergman not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist but i liked the way he tries hard to please goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie hawn who won a supporting oscar is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today this bedroom farce isn't terribly sophisticated and faintly reminds one of any wednesday besides but it's a welcome relief from the noisy teen oriented comedies they turn out today cactus flower is a lovely sigh from
<START> is one of the most fun and enjoyable low budget films i've seen in quite some time director jeff smith who also served as co writer cinematographer and editor definitely shows his love of under appreciated 80's horror films with this movie anyone who loves the cheesiness preposterous situations wacky and stereotypical characters of 80's horror movies will definitely love this very tongue in cheek homage to the past br br definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some it has all the excessive violence and gratuitous nudity that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80's horror movies we all love i had a blast watching from the 80's outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone i just couldn't get enough
<START> this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the cast was fantastic but the movie itself was horrible it was so awful i had to register just to say how bad it was br br i watched this movie and i wanted to break it every minute i watched it could have been great had a great premise if you're going to rob an armored car and there's a homeless person which sees you you have to do what you have to do for the main character to decide to get a cop killed and kill his friends and co workers after the homeless guy was already dead it's just ridiculous and yes i'm sure there will be responses to this about how his conscious got to him but come on br br the main character crawled out the bottom of the armored truck no one saw him he blew up the stash of money and grabbed and dragged the cop right behind the other guards and no one saw him he was able to get back in the armored car and no one saw him this movie had potential but blew it br br you couldn't pay me to watch this movie ever again don't ever watch it aggravating
