<START> i own this movie i've seen it over 20 times and every time i still get weepy its a great love story surprises and you can definately feel chemistry between klein and i definately give this movie a perfect 10 i recommend this to anyone
<START> i first saw this film in the mid 60's when i was a teenager and it moved me so much in fact the end scene where han hears of mark's death and then rushes to the hill in disbelief where you then hear mark's voice saying give me your hand and then the image of him disappears the butterfly with it's superstitious meaning the music the shattered emotions of love of han just left me sobbing my heart out i was outwardly crying bitterly my mother and sister looked up and were shocked at my reaction i just left the room to be on my own fortunately i do not react like that any more but i always cry at the end i love everything about the film the music mostly the costumes of han and location the beauty of jennifer jones and the handsome william holden they were both at their best i have the vhs and dvd of this wonderful movie i also have two versions of the music lyrics by arthur newman and sammy i also have the book a many thing by han i recommend this film 100
<START> my take even splendid underwater photography can salvage a familiar script and paper thin characters br br for those who haven't already got enough of the free willy pictures flipper might serve up a decent rental others are heavily suggested to stay away although flipper is harmless affair it hardly showcases anything for the adult audience unless it's your first time to see a dolphin br br a remake of a 1960's tv show and film flipper may have sound like a good idea back then a dolphin charms the life of boy and a girl they help ave the environment by first getting rid of toxic wastes thrown in on the sparkling waters of the florida keys and at the same time battle a shark and a salty sea baddie who happens to be the one responsible for the toxic dumping and also happens to hate dolphins but even for the 90's especially if an eerily similar film like free willy was a recent hit flipper is just another harmless yet occasionally empty summer splash movie for the kids although the animals this in case is the main dolphin a clumsy pelican and a realistic looking hammerhead shark typecast as the villain and the pristine underwater cinematography steal the show there's nothing much in flipper to steal from anyway br br the story is completely predictable something than nowadays even a 6 year old may find evident the human cast led by a pre lord of the rings elijah wood and an out of work paul hogan have rarely anything to do but stand around and look pretty their acting skills whatever they may be to this movie is rarely revealed on screen unless you consider the acting talents of cheerful dolphin i guess not trying to recommend flipper as mindless family entertainment won't be fair but anyone over the age of 10 no make that 8 are better off renting or buying something else besides the film is about 95 minutes tops that might just give you enough time to something elsewhere without worrying about your kids that alone might be worth the rental br br rating out of 5
<START> the untold is one of the worst films i ever saw the story really seems original but it was badly bestow on screen lance henriksen a good actor ended up in this crap but hey he made a lot of low budget films you need to pay the bills you know kidding lance is a great actor but he ended up with this bunch of silly actors seriously andrea roth was there just to have a nudity scene and other actors well they were just there there was constantly a fade out fade in editing and that makes me sick that was the most horrible move that just keeps on coming and it really makes you angry it was also very predictable boring and slow it has a bizarre tempo that goes just wrong br br can't say more don't rent it or buy it you can watch it if on tv
<START> this is one of the best tv productions of a musical ever i have heard the merman cast album the angela lansbury album i have seen tyne daly live and i've seen the rosalind russell movie countless times i think bette is if not the best then tied with the best she captures not just the bravura but also the pathos of mama rose i was never a natalie wood fan so i really enjoyed cynthia in what is arguably her best role everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful the three strippers led by the always dependable christine ebersole are hard to top there was supposed to be a tv production of mame a few years back with cher but i think bette would be the best bet pun intended for auntie mame
<START> first of all this is an art film and a good one at that i loved the presentation and way it was shot very cool certain scenes were some of the more graphic horror sequences i've ever seen this film did scare me not because of suspense or shock but because i was deathly afraid that i'd soon see something really appalling that did happen in a few places but mostly at the beginning this film also dragged and the 74 minutes seemed long however if you're into film you have to see this to date i've seen nothing like it 8 10
<START> this movie is a fascinating example of luis bunuel's storytelling abilities this is a comedy that is not a comedy and a social drama that is not a social drama even though i don't think it was particularly funny it made me laugh also despite the fact that you can never take bunuel too seriously the movie made think about religion and its importance in some people's lives bunuel tells the story of a catholic priest devoted to his faith like no one else and the viewer witness what happens when the priest's undying commitment to serve others is put to test as usual bunuel's target is catholicism but i don't think he tried to mock the church as he often does at least i didn't take the film as a mockery of the institution i think he is trying to make an interesting point about how religion could be a nuisance in today's modern society not because faith in itself is bad but because people always mange to the concept message aside i think this is one of bunuel's most clever works francisco is superb as the priest definitely one of the filmmaker's best movies
<START> when a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to a remote island they soon find that their new home is inhabited by a strangely menacing doctor richard johnson of zombi 2 fame a mad scientist joseph cotten his beautiful daughter barbara bach and a horde of superstitious natives the tribesmen say that the doctor has created grotesque half human half fish creatures for evil secretive purposes and though at first the prisoners do not believe this as they disappear one by one they begin to change their minds is a very entertaining mix of mysterious island and humanoids from the deep there is plenty of gore with really cool decapitation scene and throat tearing to boost the acting is so so but the film is fast paced and entertaining give it a look 8 out of 10
<START> i love this show it's clever and very well acted david morse and andre braugher have great chemistry the writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief after every new episode i'm always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is my only complaint would be donna murphy's absence at this point in the second season as david morse ex wife heather she added such character to the show br br i think this show is a credit to the crime drama genre with that said i can not for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating would someone please who gave this show a 1 rating back it up with a critique
<START> this movie is a real shame not just for the plot the empty performance of the characters it is for the lack of creativity from the director and all the crew this is maybe one of the worst movies of all times and it is hard to believe that is the sequel of one of the most famous movies of the 90's br br i am a great fan of the mask when i went to see this movie i was expecting to a movie with a good sense of humor a movie with a acceptable plot instead i saw a really bad copy of chuck jones and tex avery cartoons the movie was not funny even for my 7 years old sister so i wonder what was wrong new line cinema was it trying to repeat the success of the first movie or was it trying to create another masterpiece like the lord of the rings because if they did they were completely out of their minds
<START> i was surprised to read the comments of the person who so disliked this film it really is quite funny there are definitely a few laugh out lines that my boyfriend and i quote to each other some of the situations might be unsettling bisexuality drugs a particularly strange child's view of sexuality but believable at the same time it's about communication and miscommunication between men and women
<START> amazing one of my favorite movies way down at the bottom guess i can take some pride in not liking what the general populace tends to go for jackie mason is hilarious in this movie and so's randy quaid i can never get enough of his strong arm tactics just like in moving he was also notable in national lampoon's christmas vacation love that guy
<START> death bed the bed that eats is a supremely bizarre horror film that truly has to be seen to be believed there is an ancient four poster bed that just loves to eat humans and it does so anytime it can lure anyone to lie upon it there is also a long dead artist imprisoned behind one of his paintings who provides a voice over narration george barry's the first and only one film offers some truly surreal moments such as the bed absorbing its victims in a mysterious sea of yellow foam and liquid the atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a little bit of gore unfortunately the premise is rather silly and the acting is amateurish still as fan of unusual cinema i enjoyed this low budget oddity give it a chance 8 out of 10
<START> quite possibly one of the greatest wastes of celluloid of the past 100 years not only does it suffer from a painfully and enormously predictable disjointed script but it's clearly a carbon copy of alien ii within five minutes i had correctly predicted who would die and who wouldn't and in which order the special effects are laughable there is a scene where one crew member is mauled unconvincingly by two that look like a pair of teddy bears and the sparse humor is misplaced and dire there are better things to do with a vcr remote than use it to watch this movie
<START> i couldn't even sit through the whole thing this movie was a piece of crap i had more fun watching tell mom the dead it was just too painful to watch say besides austin powers has tom arnold ever been in a hit movie
