<START> this is a dreadful adaption of charles kingsley's story the animation is to put it bluntly awful and the songs are a disgrace to film songs the high song which they keep repeating i feel sorry for jon pertwee and david jason 2 of britain's finest talents providing the voice for the depressing animation sequence tries his best to perform in this awful production but fails br br avoid this film at all costs even if it is the last film on this planet
<START> wagon master is a very unique film amongst john ford's work mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by john ford himself the story that was elaborated by frank nugent and director's son Â patrick ford and turned into a screenplay and because of director's personal opinion regarding it wagon master is the film john ford called the one which came closest to being what i had wanted to to say so is not to say a little but as ford confessed once to lindsay anderson his favourite was nonetheless my darling clementine and not any other br br wagon master has all ingredients one might expect to find in a john ford's film wonderful cast delivering his best thou not featuring any major stars except the most of all actors Â ben johnson very peculiar small characters who provide an obligatory comic relief and wagon master has quite a few of them such as horn blowing sister jane darwell in her shot but very inspired gigs and last but not least legendary monument valley with john ford's fifth passage through it after stagecoach my darling clementine fort apache and she wore a yellow ribbon br br the film starts with two friends cowboys travis blue ben johnson and sandy owens harry carey jr being hired to be wagon masters or guides for a caravan of mormon settlers who are headed to silver valley a place that's for them like a promised land on their way they are joined by a very peculiar dr hall alan mowbray with two beautiful women who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors they are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest town and have no other place to go nothing particularly unpleasant happens till they bump into a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are on the run from the marshal of the town where they recently committed murder and bank robbery br br overall wagon master is no more nor less than one more precious pearl in a necklace of john ford's wonderful westerns a must see 9 10 br br
<START> in out in my opinion is a very hilarious movie i thought that cameron matt dillon was wrong to say that howard kevin kline was gay the part i liked most was howard's bachelor party this was because they were cracking jokes about a lot of things including barbra streisand films i also thought that emily joan cusack looked very beautiful in her wedding dress and that howard looked good in his tuxedo my favorite quote of in out is is everybody gay is this 'the twilight zone' that was absolutely hilarious the one character i couldn't stand was sonya shalom harlow this was because she was very conceited and snobby in conclusion i recommend this movie to all you kevin kline fans who have not seen it be prepared to laugh hard and have a good time when you see it
<START> this film is engaging and complex while maintaining simple beauty our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness but it is a springboard for learning these people they 're life styles and pasts which support this br br the two lead actors were in the moment as any two actors i have ever seen 100 believable they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly into their world the actors' seamless acting teamed with beautiful realistic dialog and his truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finale this film is visual treat soft increasing the intensity of the story the soundtrack the viewer soothing yet drawing out the emotional content of the film i find this project to be nothing short of a masterpiece intriguing intense
<START> minor plot spoilers br br i must confess to having a soft spot for wayne crawford i know little about him but he appears to have masses of enthusiasm to compensate for his lack of talent in his films he usually performs multi tasks perm any 3 from lead male director producer and script writer tackling story lines from the sub basement despite this the end product is usually enjoyable fun for the non discerning br br 'the evil features crawford as a down on his luck captain of a ramshackle charter boat a bit like bogart in 'to have have not' the similarities between the films ends here though br br the story begins with an underwater scene with two divers searching a wreck before being attacked by an unseen creature bit like the start of 2' the wreck turns out to be that of the 'el diablo' which went down centuries earlier the ship was manned by heretic priests on the run from spain with a cargo of stolen church treasure this allows the introduction of various links to supernatural forces with lucifer and the armageddon both getting a look in the films title refers to this sunken devil ship rather than any malevolent sea creature br br whatever faults the film has and there are many it is fun to watch and competently made you can't help but like a film which in the final 5 minutes copies the famous beach scene in 'from here to and the final line from 'casablanca'

<START> we saw this film in toronto at the film festival last year it was a truly moving experience i had heard of the truth and process but as others have written did not know much about the details of the process this film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts understand the events from the points of view of others involved and grieve together archbishop tutu and the others involved in developing the t r process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions seeing this film gave me hope for the human race if we can do t r we just might not destroy ourselves people will look back at t and r as the first step out of human adolescence and toward maturity br br as a film of course there were flaws i did not notice any major problems in acting directing or writing but for the first time in years i was totally lost in a film so perhaps i did not notice br br see this film the audience in toronto would not give up the stage for the next film we had so many questions and comments for the stars and director tom hooper jamie bartlett and went outside to the sidewalk to continue the conversation people came by just to shake their hands and thank them for the film it moved us all
<START> bilge 2002 film distant his third feature film his first was 1997's black and white the small town is a significant step up from his good but flawed 1999 film clouds of may the earlier film had potential but reeked of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst ways plot holes and wooden acting from amateurs that clouds of may succeeded on any level was a testament to talent as a budding filmmaker however distant is arrival on the international scene as a great artist one who has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like ingmar bergman although his screenplay is not as dialogue heavy it is just as brooding and he lacks bergman's penchant for close ups his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors and yasujiro ozu whose penetrating scenes of contemplation the bulk of the film takes place in snowy istanbul the fact that it in turkey will likely surprise some which lends the film a definite feel as well as reminding one of some of the bleak snowy urban images from kieslowski's the decalogue the natural images invoke the best of werner herzog as they tend to go on a beat or two longer than standard film theory would dictate which is what makes them even more memorable while the urban landscapes range from the nearly compositions of michelangelo antonioni to the cultural hagiography of woody allen one shot of a bench overlooking water is a direct quotation read steal from manhattan save the lack of the brooklyn bridge in the background in another scene similarly quotes a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from ozu's tokyo story yet like all great artists makes his appropriations his own art by slightly altering them and keeping them apropos to his own film's distant is a film whose title the characterization within the film and the feeling some viewers will have toward them but it does not describe the film itself for scenes stay with one long after the film ends perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when stalks his ex wife at the istanbul airport and watches her with her new husband as they head to board the plane that will remove her from his life forever as he watches her from a distance we see her catch just a glance of him watching her will she leave her husband and return to not in this film he pulls back behind a column and merely turns her head back to her future is her past and she knows how to best move on just keep moving will never get it most rarely get such moments of insight into themselves of life that some viewers will get the film and that gets his own powers of creation shows that ignorance can teach as long as one moves about it distant does albeit it at just the right length
<START> this movie was one of those movies where it completely fooled me into thinking that it was a cheesy 80's slasher flick based on the cover but it wasn't it was quite possibly one of the worst slasher films that i have ever seen the picture on the cover did not match any part or scene in the movie in fact it didn't involve a chainsaw not even the tag line fit the movie the film is about a group of cheerleaders and two potheads who escape to a desolate cabin in the cold woods for a weekend getaway however things get extra chilly when they start to get murdered by an unknown killer at the same time the local sheriff's department is hunting down a dangerous killer i'll name the problems in a list br br 1 the acting boy was it cheap and horribly bad it felt unnatural and it seemed as thought it was very scripted none of the actors seemed as though they tried to perform with good intentions and therefore they seemed silly and tired there was bad acting by all the characters in the movie so i won't point out specific people but i wills say that the stoners did a horrible job as well as the police and the cheerleaders which is not a surprise br br 2 the plot this story had set up a perfect storyline for good ol' fashion slasher flick but instead they peppered it with plot holes useless and unnecessary scenes and an overall stupid back story to the killer's intentions there were major plot holes including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and yet still be there in the group of girls when it happened the ex con virtually served no purpose in the movie aside from being a useless plot device there was random and unnecessary sex and nudity sprinkled throughout it even for a b movie or my taste it was a bit too much as for the killer's intentions lets just say it was stupid and it makes no sense as to why she he is killing young girls plus there was also some very predictable kills that i saw coming about 30 miles away br br 3 the technical side the lighting was okay it certainly wasn't the worse lighting that i've seen in a movie but there were points where it was supposed to be dark but it looked more like the afternoon the house seemed darker with the lights on then with the lights off the camera work was average it didn't have any good establishing shots or amazing pans or zooms thought it did get the job done is building some suspense with it's framing br br overall this movie in the sense of plot character development and performance was a huge disappointment and a waste of my time what i thought would have been a great slasher flick turned out to be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen the acting was really bad and wooden there was hardly any sense in the plot and there was no emotion to this film however the technical aspect of this film saved it for me because if the camera work or the lighting was bad then i would have turned off the dvd player and popped in something else i would recommend this movie to those who enjoy really cheesy b movies as well as those who follow cult classics because this movie certainly is i would partially recommend this film for those who enjoy 80s slasher flicks but for me this movie was pitiful and utterly horrible
<START> a really terrible movie really low budget with terrible acting a convoluted and inane plot a modest reworking of the vampire tales mixed with modern science br br the result is a total mess without meaning for most parts with very limited and cheap effects it is not even fun like several of the low budget independent movies of this kind br br a waste of time
<START> i honestly dont know why so many people hate this movie i have always thought that it was one of my absolute faves the fight with tiger and his men rocked the fight with the pirates with the axes rocked the whole skit with everyone trying to avoid one another in the house is pure genious ok so it didnt have the requisite kick ass final confrontation but the manchus were pretty good i give it a 8 10
<START> what could be expected from any adam sandler produced comedy grandma's boy is predictable and so dumb it is sickening allen covert stars as alex in the film a 35 year old pothead who works as a video game tester and has had to move in with his grandma and her two roommates after losing his apartment some usual plot turns occur he has trouble adjusting to his new living situation which in turn makes him have trouble at work which is particularly bad because he is trying to nail one of the new consultants throw a weird boss almost alien company star really nerdy best friend a few scenes at burnt out pot dealer's place a really big party scene and an original video game alex is trying to finish by himself into the mix you have grandma's boy in its entirety allen covert does make a marginally good lead linda is cute enough for her role as the just one of the nerds office consultant samantha and a few scenes do manage to squirt out a chuckle or two but none of that makes grandma's boy worth much of anyone's time most of the supposed funny jokes or gags or whatever you want to call them are nothing but humor that would make anyone at national lampoons embarrassed to watch joel moore is incredibly unfunny in his role as video game mastermind j p and the entire film actually manages to be boring on top of not funny or substantial well at least grandma's boy did something for someone adam sandler was able to get a few paychecks to his out of work friends david spade kevin and rob schneider
<START> mr baseball was a fun video rental with my fiancÃ© susan susan said that she had been looking forward to seeing the movie ken oda as a tough yet honorable manager makes sense ken has made so many wonderful asian movies i correct the one reviewer and say is still a cinematic presence with films like of course everyone likes tom selleck yet ken is the better dramatic actor of the two today someone accused me of being yakuza well i say that my great uncle shadow president jack f kennedy myself and others are part of the legitimate human leadership in our universe and thanks to our humans are free people fighting all the parts of adversity that president kennedy talked about in his inaugural address to be honest someone has kept food prices very low in canada on things like bread in honor of our please stop eating amphibians reptiles and eggs i hope that there will one day be a sequel to mr baseball with father ken oda still as manager thank you to imdb for supporting freedom of speech like the kind president george w bush and i support support imdb
<START> jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles his performance is simply genius he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself ray charles is legendary he is well established as a musician and the music is deep complex and innovative even more innovative than i realized before watching this movie the film should make new fans of a young audience who might come into it knowing little about his music ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician i confess that i knew very little about the man's life until i saw this film i came out of it being impressed with ray charles' courage strength and innovation as man and musician
<START> the new celebrity deathmatch is terrible they kill off the popular people and make the low budget celebs win i mean andy lil' flip lil flip and lil wayne should of both died lil' flip sucks the fight between lil' jon and lil' bow wow and lil flip was mad corny and short they should of just kill off all of them why did tobey lose to jake and christian lose to adam they are better actors and superheroes they also spend too much time on talking rather than fighting which can bore the viewers everything seems rushed for some reason they can't just make a long fight the old deathmatch is way better
