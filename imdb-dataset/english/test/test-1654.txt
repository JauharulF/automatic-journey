<START> this movie wasn't good i thought it'd be a cute disney movie just like the original wrong it was awkward for christina ricci whom i expect so much more than this you could just tell by watching i think doug e doug did the best he could sit 5 year olds in front of the this any older and they might start to fall asleep

<START> wow the french are really getting the hang of it if we look at their first asterix movie we see a good story with nice actors especially thanks to gerard depardeu but very lame special effect in a fantasy story like asterix special effects are really important well they did it right this time it looks terrific i think mission cleopatra is the best asterix story ever written in the movie there's not one moment you're bored go and watch this one thing they didnt go exactly by the script which i think is a little bit for example in the comic breaks the nose of the sphinx immediatly all the little storekeepers start breaking of the nose of their miniature sphinx really funny to see well they didnt put it in the movie instead they the nose under the sphinx asterix they will never look for it here guess again was funny but not as good as the original another thing i disliked about the movie was their choice for music it maked the film to but never the less it's a must c br br da jean holland
<START> i enjoyed this movie okay it just could have been so much better i was expecting more action than what i got which was more of a comedy than anything else granted it was serious in parts and it had a good fight scene here and there for the most part it was more romance and comedy with some action and no horror at all which is hard to do with a vampire movie a vampire hunter loses his partner and must train another his sister is going through a difficult break up but she is being pursued by a vampire of all things granted this vampire is rather nice and not into sucking blood so that is all there is really to it except for a plot of another vampire after certain royal vampires so he can gain ultimate power some of the problems with this movie is that its plot went here and there and the movie had a very uneven flow to it that and it seemed to shift genres a bit much too one minute action the next pure comedy however the girls were cute there is good action the comedy was worthy of a chuckle or two and jackie chan makes a rather energetic appearance or two this movie probably just needed more development in some areas such as the villain who is basically not really explored at all so for a movie with a few good fights and a chuckle or two this is rather good though why was it rated r i have seen stuff we have made that is pg 13 that is a lot worse than this
<START> brief marital infidelity comes back to haunt loving wife grace needham portrayed by the always sexy nastassja kinski br br she had left town and her depressing husband to embark on a trip to sunny miami where she was pursued and ultimately seduced by julian grant a handsomely evil and manipulative business executive who is portrayed very well by william baldwin why do all of the baldwin brothers play evil people so damn well br br the seducing of grace took place as the two drank champagne on a deserted beach they reached privately by grace admitted she drank too much for her own good and revealed the many problems in her marriage julian gained her confidence by claiming he would never allow those types of problems to occur if he had a relationship with grace julian's manipulation continued as he described a lost at sea fantasy involving the now uninhibited grace who sat near listening to his every word and becoming more and more engaged with his romantic dream br br his manipulation paid off as a few subtle nudges led to grace's soft kisses paused momentarily by her pulling back as if suddenly thinking to herself what am i doing i'm a wife i'm a mother i have a real life real responsibilities sure the two of us have talked about being together lost at sea but that is just a fantasy look at what we're doing here the consequences are real we're really alone on a secluded beach am i going to let this fantasy really happen ' br br she succumbs to the dream as her kisses became more passionate the once guarded grace who used to respond to men's propositions by saying i'm married enjoyed watching as julian her shirt leading to more kisses body caresses and her climbing onto julian's lap she smiles kisses moans laughs and frequently looks up at the sun throughout what unfortunately was a brief love making scene in which everybody seemed to have most of their clothes on br br while i thoroughly enjoyed the look of illicit passion on grace's face as the once devoted wife was being thoroughly satisfied by having sex with a man that clearly enjoys manipulating others i will say that on the whole the scene was undeserving of the movie's r rating br br julian returned home to find her husband rejuvenated from his securing of a high paying job and she is excited about being able to return to a normal life where she can once again be a loving wife and caring mother br br but the evil julian grant reenters the picture and is not willing to give up so easily on grace grace has a plan to rid her life of julian but will it work br br obviously i don't want to ruin the remaining story line for you however i will say that i always enjoy movies involving sexual pretense by a wife especially when she exhibits uninhibited attraction and behavior that is normally reserved for her husband but in actuality is seeking revenge against the antagonist this movie would have been much much better if the movie had included more of that in the story line my feelings are if the movie brings it up then the movie should finish it and this movie definitely brought it up unfortunately certain constraints in the story line prevented this from being significantly pursued there are many other movies available that succeed with that very point and i'll include their titles in the recommendations portion of this section i'm also open to receiving emailed suggestions of other movies that contain a good story line involving sexual pretense on the part of a seemingly devoted wife br br overall nastassja kinski and william baldwin are both very good the movie is not
<START> the egyptian is set during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world the pharaoh who thirteen centuries before christ attempted to introduce a monotheistic religion to ancient egypt the main character however is not but rather the fictitious as a baby is found mysteriously floating in a basket on the river nile and adopted by the physician and his wife when he grows to manhood he follows his adopted father into the medical profession initially working as his father did among the poor of the city but he comes to prominence after he and his friend the ambitious young soldier save the pharaoh's life while on a hunting expedition in the desert is appointed court physician but becomes obsessed with the babylonian courtesan not only ruins himself in a vain attempt to win her love but is also disgraced when his neglect of his duties means that he is unable to save the life of daughter br br flees into exile where he achieves success as a healer in neighbouring countries but returns to egypt when he learns of a hittite plot to invade although readily forgives him for his previous finds the country in turmoil the pharaoh's attempts to introduce a new religion have led to civil strife between his followers and those of the priests of the old faith and he is too pacific by nature to take any steps to confront the hittite threat becomes embroiled in a plot by now the general of the egyptian army and sister princess to overthrow the pharaoh and replace him with a more effective monarch br br the film's weaknesses arise mostly from its two romantic subplots in the course of the film is revealed as the long lost son of the previous pharaoh and half brother to and it might therefore surprise a modern audience that she should fall in love with him marriage between brothers and sisters were not necessarily considered as incestuous by the standards of egyptian royalty but the standards of 1950s cinema audiences were generally less liberal on this point in any case the love triangle is an unnecessary complication and detracts from role in the film that of the voice of cold eyed cynical br br the subplot which takes up most of the first hour of the film is overwritten and excessively melodramatic is morally worthless but fascinating and the role needed an actress of great beauty and also great dramatic skill to make her credible especially as achieves the difficult task of winning away from a woman as lovely as jean simmons who plays merit rival for her affections it is therefore unfortunate that the role went to an actress as comically inept as bella whose only qualification was that she was the mistress of the producer darryl f zanuck was not only a wooden actress but also spoke with a thick foreign accent made even more incomprehensible by a lisp she was not even particularly attractive by comparison with the two legendary hollywood beauties in the film simmons and gene tierney who plays br br the film is better when it concentrates on its main political and religious themes the other actors are better than although peter ustinov as servant makes the same mistake as in spartacus that of trying to bring comic relief into a film that does not need it his voice anyway was far too patrician for a comic servant role br br edmund purdom a little known british actor was thrust into the main role when marlon brando pulled out at the last minute but more than adequately fills the great man's shoes even though his style of acting was quite different he copes well with the challenge of showing the changes in character from unworldly idealist to lovesick fool to embittered cynic to the enlightened visionary of the final scenes victor mature was never the most expressive of actors but he is well suited to the role of a practical down to earth man of action he is better here than he was in his other epic from 1954 and the gladiators simmons is luminously beautiful as merit br br michael wilding hitherto best known to me as the second mr elizabeth taylor plays as a would be philosopher king who ends as a sort of holy fool his inability to make difficult decisions makes him an unsuitable ruler but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice which lend him an air of moral greatness far beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne although had more in common with the supreme being of the than with the old testament jehovah or the christian god there is a quite deliberate attempt to draw parallels between and christianity in the film the symbol is the doubtless chosen because of its resemblance to a cross but in reality it was a common egyptian for life not unique to language often has a biblical ring to it his comparison of himself to wind whistling in the desert recalls john the voice crying in the wilderness hence the title of this review finding in the river parallels the old testament story of moses br br at the end of the film who has become the inheritor of the spirit of the dead achieves a moral greatness of his own the message of the film is that while we may need practical men of action like we also need visionaries and thinkers who are prepared to ask the question why for all its faults the egyptian is a film which is idealistic and humane in its approach to both religion and politics 7 10
<START> worth it for if not for mick work then for judith lucy she brings her usual classy style of unbridled foul to the role and steals the show in parts br br imho i'm not much of an autograph hunter but i have collected 3 the first is samuel l jackson's the other 2 are in this movie tony martin and mick altho martin only makes a cameo appearance not only stars but co wrote and co produced this flick i've been a fan of their for years now apparently i was the only one laughing during the on set urination in the first episode of the short lived the mick show so i went in to this with high expectations i'm happy to say i wasn't disappointed with mick doing a lot of the work on this thing there's plenty of his usual trademarks phrases like blow it out your arse and these bowls are s house are all over the place aswell as plenty of winnie blues being sucked down it's also the sort of stupid original story you'd expect from someone like him this is like one of those american sporting comedies where they make a baseball team out of prisoners or something but rather than trying to make a dull american sport like baseball or gridiron interesting this movie focuses on a sport usually left to grey army lawn bowls but the main difference between this and other sporting type comedies is that this is actually very very funny what's even better is that even tho the subject of this movie is a young lout joining an old folks game it's never insulting to the elderly and it never gets sickeningly soppy or anything it's just good laughs at genuine 1972 prices mick is great in the first real acting role i've ever seen him in as is judith lucy and the rest of the cast but then most of them have had a lot of practice this is the best australian comedy i've seen in a long time go see it and learn the joys of lawn bowls br br it's a bit like major league br br score 8 10
<START> a team of tough rogue new york cops led by the rugged hard nosed buddy manucci superbly played by the always excellent roy scheider go after a group of nasty mobsters involved in a kidnapping ring after one of their number gets killed by them director philip the producer of bullet and the french connection ably creates a potent gritty starkly amoral no nonsense tone maintains a steady pace throughout and stages the action scenes with considerable rip roaring vigor don ellis' rousing string score further pumps up the intensity while the scrappy big apple locations and rough grainy cinematography both greatly enhance the overall grungy realism moreover the fine line distinguishing cops from criminals gets chillingly blurred in this picture the titular squad use harsh brutish and morally dubious strong arm tactics as a means to an end for enforcing the law and there's certainly no code of honor amongst the thugs and thieves who populate the seedy urban underbelly that's vividly depicted in this movie nice supporting performances by tony lo bianco as wormy sniveling snitch vito lucia the undertaker richard lynch as vicious psychotic hoodlum moon bill hickman as moon's equally coldblooded partner bo jerry leon as funky and joe spinell as a parking garage attendant an extremely wild and exciting protracted heart in your throat mondo destructo car chase qualifies as a definite highlight the climactic shootout likewise delivers the stirring goods a real bang up little winner
<START> i love juan piquer simÃ³n he's my absolute favorite bad movie director and throughout his whole career he incompetently tried to cash in on simply every successful contemporary trend in the horror and fantasy genres after the big hit that was superman j p made his own and hilarious supersonic man he picked in on the violent slasher movie madness with the insane pieces and he really over trumped himself with the return of e t the unofficial and downright laughable sequel to spielberg's sf blockbuster the rift is obviously inspired by the series of profitable underwater monster movies like the abyss and six from start to finish you can amuse yourself by spotting all the stolen ideas and shameless rip offs of these and other classics when a completely new and fancy type of submarine vanishes near the deep rift a second mission with u boat designer hayes on board is sent out to investigate what really happened to siren one in the dark depths of the ocean the rescue mission discovers an underwater cavern where the government secretly experiments with mutant sea creatures the monsters are quite aggressive but there's also the danger of a government enemy among the crew members the rift is a forgettable film but it nevertheless has some ingenious Â though very dodgy Â monster models fans of blood and gore won't complain neither as the beastly attacks are quite gruesome and merciless the acting is very wooden although many of the cast names can definitely do better it's advisable that you simply enjoy the clichÃ©s and gory effects in the the rift because if you start contemplating about the screenplay you'll find that it makes absolutely no sense
<START> okay i really tried to tap into the so called silly surreal humor that this film sets out to be i'm told that the japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one shipped to america go figure and has less political references apart from all that i found this sexual political farce just as boring and pointless as standard porn the central female lead is easy on the eyes and could actually act i would love to see her in a non pink film where she could actually flex her acting muscles and no not the ones you're thinking of it's obvious that japan can and does produce just as much crap as other countries i couldn't recommend this to anyone with the distant possibility of someone who has a jones for asian porn go see a real japanese film
<START> this movie is everything but the true story of devi director shekhar kapoor's claims are countered by the fact that he made the entire movie without even once meeting devi on whose life this movie is supposed to be based the excuse being that meeting the woman would have interfered with director's conception of the story the film wastes the opportunity of the society of the plight of low caste women in the indian society and ends up as a stereotype portraying devi as an angry woman whose sole motivation is revenge no wonder this shekhar kapoor's film was successful in the west as it catered to their non bollywood tastes
<START> farscape is the one sci fi show which restarted the interest in science fiction in me br br but farscape is so much more then plain and simple sci fi comedy drama and much more the acting is very good luckily farscape survived also it's cancellation and showed with wars that it is not dead yet i hope there is a future for farscape in my opinion it is also not problematic that some of the characters in the show are muppets you have to look behind that and you will see what a beauty farscape is br br farscape set a new standard in television and i think it will be truly hard for new shows to prove that they can be equal or better than farscape i love this show br br
<START> i'm not sure this film could ever match the first one even if it starred the original seven notwithstanding the fact that four were killed it just doesn't have the spark and chemistry all the actors seem tired and look as if they are just going through the motions to get their paychecks br br it's interesting how yul brynner is magnificent in the original film but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel yet when he stars in westworld and futureworld in the 1970s his character in the same matching black pants shirt and hat evokes the same mystery and presence of the 1960 film's chris adams br br there's nothing in this 1966 flick to make it worth watching even on cable
<START> the time i wasted seeing this movie i demand back i felt sick afterward but not because it touched me in any way it's pretentious trying to get the audience to feel bad for the people involved but i couldn't care less the characters are soulless and stupid you don't get an explanation for some of the scenes and it doesn't leave any thoughts afterward to come up with your own explanation all of the students in the movie has issues but since you don't feel for them you don't believe their problems br br if i could write better in english i'd never stop but i can't so i'll stop now br br don't watch this
<START> i saw the episode about living on minimum wage it went as far as an oprah appearance for the said episode it's bad enough people struggle making ends meet week to week then having this hypocrite exploiting the problem i didn't appreciate the constant complaining from him or his significant other throughout is how any people have the power to pay their medical bills from the er sure he shows that the bill is high but he paid the remaining balance from his own pocket after wards from his harrowing experience how many poor people have that type of privilege after 30 days to pay off their bills instead they are starving and robbing peter to pay paul complaining throughout the episode isn't a humbling thing for him the movie and restaurant scene is appalling another privilege he has that poor people don't
