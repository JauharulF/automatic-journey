<START> never mind if 'national velvet 1944 ' is a bit hackneyed and occasionally unconvincing clarence brown's equestrian fable is an endearing and very likable story with a good moral after achieving modest success through her appearance in come home 1943 ' young elizabeth taylor age 12 landed her first leading role as velvet brown a passionate schoolgirl with an obsession for horses though filmed in california the story adapted from a novel by enid is set in a small township on the english countryside and full advantage is taken of the technicolor photography to present the vibrant and handsome landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs mickey rooney takes top billing as mi taylor a misguided ex jockey with devious intentions whose relationship with young velvet reawakens his sense of dignity and opens a new optimistic chapter in his life though he noticeably struggles in one sequence when he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses rooney is enjoyable as the surly but passionate young man who must prove his worth br br it is perhaps a good thing that elizabeth taylor had those entrancing violet eyes because her acting abilities at this young age were rather limited her more emotional sequences in which she displays courage and integrity in the face of adversity strike one as being rather hollow and the touchingly naive notion that simply believing will accomplish everything is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by practically every unmemorable inspirational sporting film ever made nevertheless taylor is bright eyed and enthusiastic and she works well with mickey rooney who was no stranger to being a child star anne revere plays a very important role as mother once a famous athlete who not only swam the english channel but was lovingly trained by none other than mi taylor's own father i liked that mi was not told about this until the film's final seconds with mrs brown correctly deciding that the young man would first need to develop his own sense of decency rather than exploiting the memory of his late father for financial gain as he would undoubtedly have done at the film's beginning br br the film reaches its climax at the grand national sweepstakes where velvet has at the last moment decided to ride her own horse the pi in the world famous competition under the guise of a latvian male she goes on as expected to win the race but is later disqualified either because she's a girl or because she tumbled from the horse before she was allowed to dismount what a stupid rule this extended race sequence is exceedingly well done effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve racking pre race seconds and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as rooney's character stranded behind tall spectators and waiting anxiously for somebody to provide an accurate update it doesn't really matter that we know it's a stunt double doing most of the difficult riding in several scenes we can clearly see a creepy looking man in a wig but the positive message remains the same i'll wager that 'national velvet' has nurtured the imaginations of millions of young girls over the last sixty years and it's power to inspire has decreased little with time
<START> is a charming if slightly animated movie that considering it was made in the 1941 has stood the test of time incredibly well now i have to admit i have a soft spot for to town' as it is called in the united kingdom having watched a vhs version taped of the tv by our parents many times with my siblings imagine my surprise when i woke up this morning just in time to catch it on channel four at never the less the film was just as delightful as i remembered it with the animation standing the test of time and a lovely moral tale which should appeal to parents and children alike maybe one day i to shall share this forgotten classic with children of my own with a nice running time for kids 88 min's and a simple yet involving storyline there really is something for everyone in this tale of the little guy coming good i really could see this being successfully remade in cgi take note pixar
<START> pam grier is the super soul sister of the 1970's appearing in many blaxploitation films that have recently been discovered and appreciated by a new generation i can safely say that black mama white mama may be the worst pam grier movie i've ever seen br br grier is lee and margaret markov is karen they are two female prisoners who escaped from prison after karen's revolutionary friends attacked the paddy wagon chained to each other the film becomes the defiant ones for women but has three separate plots a fat criminal filipino sleaze star vic diaz wants lee dead a cowboy bounty hunter the excellent sid haig searches for the two girls and karen's revolutionary friends search for her the film eventually becomes so convoluted and uninvolved with the two women that the title should have been men chasing women grier an action star is not given any chance to participate in any of the many overlong action scenes markov is excellent as karen and grier is ok as lee but both are eventually forgotten in the many subplots one interesting scene has the bounty hunter forcing a police officer and his chief to drop their pants so he can shoot the one with the smallest penis judged by his whore but is easily forgotten amidst all the mayhem br br black mama white mama starts out great as a women in prison film complete with lesbian wardens and a shower scene then completely switches to a chase film if director eddie romero famous for directing filipino horror films had just stuck with the wip theme he would have been fine instead gets real old real fast and the surprise ending just makes the audience wonder why they sat through a 90 minute film for it to end like this another problem where is the film supposed to be set while some of the accents are hispanic and cities have spanish names los etc all the natives are obviously asian hmmm recommended only for die hard grier fans who even then will be disappointed
<START> i just got done watching this movie and i have to say it was a good film i loved some of the good guy's and i loved the killer robot but the movie had some in it br br the name's of the people in it was kind of stupid i think people should of sued the maker's of this movie for how lame it was at the end the first half hour was good but then it just dragged on and on then i was happy it was over but still loved the the killer robot and some of the movie's good guy's in it br br i think it was the best two buck's i have ever spent because i do like stupid b movie's like this one and come on it is a b movie everyone
<START> the dresser is perhaps the most refined of backstage films the film is brimming with wit and spirit for the most part provided by the energetic character of norman tom although his character is clearly gay and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer albert finney that he assists the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is br br the gritty style of peter yates that worked so well in bullitt is again on display and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence this is much appreciated in a story that could so easily have become tedious in the end the dresser will bore many people silly but it will truly be a delight to those who love british cinema br br 7 7 out of 10
<START> this film is a tour de force from julie who directs and does the stage design and masks no one comes near to matching her imagination on the modern operatic stage since making this film in 1992 she has had much success in film making and in directing musicals one can only hope that she can be persuaded to return to opera one day i would love to see a ring cycle directed by her the current at covent garden has giants with over sized hands just like the characters in this film the current butterfly at uses japanese puppetry coincidence maybe or evidence that influence is pervasive br br uses fantastical costumes masks puppets and origami birds to recreate the story of oedipus on a stage set on stilts above a lake red ribbons are a recurring theme they are used as an umbilical chord when oedipus is born they hang down from eyes after he has blinded himself in a breathtaking effect they are used to make a crossroads when slaying of his father is by puppets br br this neo classical opera ballet by enjoyed justified obscurity until this film brought it to life the music is uninspired but inoffensive and philip jesse norman and a very young make the most of it the singers are fairly immobile in accordance with wishes min tanaka is the dancing oedipus to singing oedipus this creates some slight confusion towards the end when dancing oedipus pokes out the eyes of singing oedipus br br the libretto is in latin but do not worry if your high school latin is a bit rusty there is a helpful narrator who introduces and describes each scene in japanese
<START> when i was 8 years old and going through my marx brothers phase my father read in the tv guide that they were showing the marx brothers film the big store late on friday night and set the vcr to tape it for me when i woke up on saturday due no doubt to a in the tv guide my father and i discovered the story of mankind had been recorded instead br br the big store was probably one of the least funny of all the marx brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the century's finest works of cinema when compared with the story of mankind i can almost justify tv error in that the marx brothers groucho chico and harpo appear in both movies although in the story of mankind they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes groucho plays peter chico plays some guy talking to christopher columbus and harpo plays isaac newton harpo's scene lasts about half a minute chico only has two or three lines groucho's scene is at least funny but horribly racially insensitive by today's standards the rest of the movie doesn't bear mentioning they trotted out some of the finest actors of the day and made them recite total garbage what a disappointment br br tv guide i sent you a nice letter i'm still waiting for an apology br br for the record the big store has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the marx brothers on roller skates and a couple of songs by virginia o'brien i was really looking forward to seeing it
<START> this movie is honestly the worst piece of rubbish i have ever seen this is slow plot less and boring the cinematographer deserved to be shot there were various aspects of unintentional comedy one of which was jared being oddly camp raised many laughs but also many yawns don't watch with anyone anytime any place if u hate someone recommend they buy or rent this big waste of time and money thanks gus van sant not i cant think of anything else to say except don't ever see this movie it will make u want to jump off a cliff hope gus and his mates read this comment before it's too late and he makes a sequel or some other catastrophe with what appeared to be shot with a camera phone
<START> peter cushing and donald pleasance are legendary actors and director kostas was the man behind the successful greek giallo esquire thriller death kiss in 1974 and yet when you combine the three talents all you get is this complete load of drivel god only knows what drove the likes of peter cushing and donald pleasance to star in this cheapie devil worship flick but i really do hope they were well paid as neither one deserves something as amateurish as this on their resumes the story focuses on a group of devil worshippers that kidnap some kids leading another group to go after them the pace of the plot is very slow and this ensures that the film is very boring the plot is also a long way from being original and anyone with even a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something a bit like this and no doubt done much better the obvious lack of budget is felt throughout and the film doesn't manage to overcome this at any point this really is a depressing and miserable watch and not even a slightly decent ending manages to up the ante enough to lift this film out of the very bottom of the barrel extremely poor stuff and definitely not recommended
<START> saw this movie when it came out and then a couple more times years later i'm watching it now 20 years later and it's still a very good story does it wreak of lifetime movie network yes but alas lifetime was not even in existence back then so it needed to air br br the cast was excellent the story was a little schmaltzy two women become close friends and unbeknownst to either one friend is having an affair with he other friends husband she's invited over to the house for a dinner party which is how she discovers that her lover is the husband of her best friend she is horrified and tries to break off the affair shortly afterwards he is tragically killed in a car accident which is for both women of course the wife finds out by accident about this affair and wants holly out of her life now but their friendship is able to prevail because they need each other br br i thought it was a very good story a great cast and i really enjoyed it
<START> this is christmas time a nativity in terms of rebirth or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the italian cinema it was something like 30 40 years that the italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size this is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the italian masterpieces of the past needless to quote any name and finally this is also a big production for italian standards of the time in this movie there is a rare balance of different elements all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition real poetry real humor real tenderness real drama real beauty no rhetoric no easy surreal shortcuts no typical like picturing no over acting no director there is also a cool use of two heartbreaking nina simone's songs whose music i reckon has never been used in a proper way for a score so if this will not be a real for the italian cinema it is an extraordinary evolution for emanuele after his another definitive beautiful film is not to be missed it is that kind of film' helpful to enjoy movie making movie watching helpful to enjoy and understand life francesco
<START> a rather silly little film you just may love br br although rather corny and clichÃ© at times it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun five teams are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest just for the sheer joy knowing yours is the best team br br notable for several screen debuts including david naughton's first film role after his dr pepper be a pepper commercials and before his major 1981 hit american werewolf in london also features paul in what i believe is his first pee wee herman esquire roll a year before he became known for it and last but not least mr spin city and alex keaton himself michael j fox gets his first film role here fans will remember stephen furst as flounder in animal house outside of that no names but all funny characters br br doubt it has ever made it to dvd but there are still probably some vhs copies floating around and you might even catch on a late late show sometime if you do is worth your watch you may hate it but it may also become a quirky little movie you come to love
<START> the world may never know the film that did take the best animated short oscar that year anna and bella is very good but it's no big snit both are available on expanded entertainment's world's greatest animation compilation in case you'd like to compare br br snit and its director richard have attracted so much attention that there's little for me to add i'd like to note however that the film contains one of my very favorite single shots in an animated short the one where the man opens the door to let the cat out i don't want to give away the actual events depicted here but the first time i saw the shot i was from one mood to another then seconds later to still another that shot has never failed to affect me that way since for this shot and for the way builds up to that set of moments the big snit deserves the tag of masterpiece
<START> first of all this movie is gross to the point of nauseating and my advice is to avoid it at all costs if you ever want to eat ice cream again i tried watching it because it looked like it might be funny but it soon became quite disturbing with the ice cream made out of body parts and surprisingly graphic effects it opens with a boy named greg witnessing the gruesome murder of an ice cream man greg subsequently goes crazy and grows up to be the title character by what appear to be mob assassins there is no explanation for this murder making it the biggest wtf moment in the entire movie other lesser wtf moments include the surreal asylum greg goes to featuring evil clowns a woman speaking in tongues because she has been possessed by the holy spirit what this has to do with anything i don't know and the fact that olivia holy crap has her career tanked this badly hussey is in it br br none of these are good enough reasons to watch it the only reason is for the character tuna who is a skinny kid with pillows stuffed under his shirt so that he looks like a fat kid for some reason this struck me as hilarious i stayed up far longer into the night than i should have watching this movie just to figure out if there was some reason they couldn't use an actual fat kid for the role although i fell asleep before the end i've gathered from other reviews that tuna ends up losing the weight okay so they didn't have the budget to pull this off realistically suggestion to the director how about making the character not overweight br br that's it if the prospect of tuna has not interested you enough there is no other reason to acknowledge this film's existence if disgusting horror movies about ice cream are your preferred source of entertainment check out the far superior the stuff instead
<START> susan sarandon and natalie portman play adele and ann august a single mother who's the working definition of the word dreamer and her solemn pragmatic daughter adele wanting to make a fresh start in a big city moves them from wisconsin to california br br decent if not exceptional or particularly memorable with some serious and sad moments it pushes some emotional buttons that's for sure best thing it offers is a solid cast and sarandon and portman are quite good in the leads even if their characters are one dimensional at times br br could be better could be worse br br i gave this one seven out of ten
