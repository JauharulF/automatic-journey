<START> i started watching this because i was looking for a nice comedy for my sunday morning then i noticed that this was going to be a road movie and i decided to actually watch this br br first 15 minutes were awful but i wanted to give this a chance because i never judge a movie without watching it throughly then things started to get little better this seemed like a nice road movie about friendship but then the movie started to get horrible predictable clichÃ© twists and when the movie was over it left you feeling like you had wasted your time did this have anything to say why did they even make a movie like this and i wasn't expecting a modern citizen kane but still i have several ideas how this movie could have been improved br br so take my piece of advice leave this alone and go watch a real road movie there are many of those i won't make the directors of those movies seem bad by putting their names on this review br br 1 10
<START> if this film had been made in the 50's or 60's critics and fans alike would have praised it i myself enjoyed the film from beginning to end it's not a timeless piece and has not aged well over the years but it is enjoyable to watch nonetheless as for mrs ritchie's acting in the film not the best on the planet but it adds to the film's unique slapstick comedy aspirations and showcases madonna's often underrated sense of comedic timing madonna plays nikki finn an ex convict who was framed for a crime she didn't commit griffin dunne plays the hapless future groom puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station where a series of unfortunate events occurs thus creating the plot and there is one folks give the film a shot you might be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is
<START> on the face of it this film looked like it might be really good it isn't br br the cast is pretty good but most of them seemed embarrassed by the whole thing the real disaster in this film is not the flood but the script it attempts to include every clichÃ© in the book all done incredibly poorly the ending is very abrupt but this is a blessing in disguise if you make it that far br br all three main male actors carlyle courtney and suchet would surely agree that this is the low point in their careers i hope they got paid a lot of cash because none of their reputations come out in tact br br the special effects are quite good but the same thing was done to much better effect in the day after tomorrow br br in short a pointless exercise don't waste your time
<START> the historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented it was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds errol flynn was never better as this role was tailored for him olivia dehavilland was never more beautiful arthur kennedy never more villainous anthony quinn never more noble than as crazy horse it had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout the one historical aspect i found most glaringly inaccurate was the final last stand which occurred on the banks of the little big horn the film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight however i still consider it marvelous entertainment typical of hollywood's golden age
<START> is an awful movie the dialogue was pointless the acting was pathetic it had virtually no story line and you can't really tell what the hell is going on half the time due to the continuity errors and plot holes br br but you will love it anyway because it pushes the boundaries on gore violence death destruction and chaos they even kill children and unborn babies in this movie you will be sitting there thinking oh my god that is disgusting and they surprise you by killing the chick who always makes it out alive' when the predator and aliens are fighting in the hospital br br it's like the movie industry has said we know what we did in the first alien vs predator movie was was bad so we're doing it again but this time we're getting help from psychopaths with vivid imaginations it's predicable moronic and down right pointless but you will be thinking about it for a while after you see it
<START> the best thing about is the dialogue like scream and i know what you did last summer this movie is cognizant of the conventions of this type of horror movie and manages to come up with a few good lines and scenes that play on those conventions unfortunately is just boring the plot is your basic ten little indians whodunnit with a monster controlled by one of the suspects victims you know from the beginning that each of the characters will get bumped off until only the hero is left to defeat the evil and this is exactly what happens absolutely no surprises and no tension production values and acting were ok but i had no motivation to watch to the end although i did because i already knew how the end scene would play out the ending did surprise me a bit because it managed to fizzle out literally instead of throwing out a bucket of special effects maybe the special effects budget had been spent up by the end
<START> now that i have seen it it was not what i was expecting at least not until the very end i read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this from amazon and was glad i did having been first introduced to park's work via oldboy i was curious to how he'd treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which he executed it i think park has matured in terms of presentation because while oldboy and some of his other work has very nice and deliberate camera work he has some nice innovations in that i had not seen in other vamp movies for example the scene where father is realizing the beast growing within him as he gives his shoes to the always barefoot tae ju and he is able to see the blood pumping through tae skin and his eye's widen in blood lust for it that was a nice effect i was also happy that park did not cg the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little cg at all i came away from being totally set up to think one thing was going to happen and get taken for a ride in true park fashion additionally i liked that park played with a little symbolism and reversal whereas we don't usually get this is asia cinema during the beginning of the movie we see the plot develop slowly and get to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that are transpiring park treats you a little like ghost of christmas future coming to show you albeit a bit boringly what life is like outside your world ah but then we start to feel a little kinship with the befallen father and his burgeoning lust for tae ju and conflict with duty as a priest we almost start to root for them even until park not so nicely slaps us back into reality and we really see that in the end is a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong it won't spoil it if i tell you to watch from the mindset of a priest and i think you'll come away from it with what park wants you to come away with don't expect oldboy and stylization because that's not what you'll get here a very interesting take on the genre indeed those who missed the many literary elements and religious allusions watched some other movie not after watch let the right one in it's also not what you'll expect either
<START> basic structure of a story beginning middle end br br sometimes this structure is played with and we get memento or irreversible and the story plays backwards sometimes it's just not linear a la pulp fiction regardless they all have a beginning middle and end br br this is the first film i have ever seen that doesn't have an end br br beginning girl's best friend is expelled br br middle girl needs to cope without best friend br br end non existent br br not that having an end would've saved this film but at least it would have been complete br br it's an exercise in apathy we get a party mix of characters and they all turn out to be duds boring vain vapid and pallid imitations of people br br and here's the action within this film nothing happens nothing at all happens mischa barton tries to talk with a plummy english accent dominique swain whines a lot and brad receives a blow job from some old guy end of movie br br by the time the credits rolled i had a horrible feeling that many prisoners must feel periods of time those precious minutes of our life have just been wasted br br the only passable point and that is a very emphatic only is brad he acts well lacey chabert i tend to like but no luck here due to good work in other films i will forgive mischa barton this travesty but i hope all cast members were slapped in the face for their involvement br br please i implore you avoid don't fool yourself into thinking i'll make up my own mind my sister told me to never see this and i ignored her wanting to make up my own mind that was a bad decision br br i have never hated a film there are many i don't like but i have never hated a film until i saw this
<START> bess was the very first movie my parents ever took me to see even at the tender age of 5 years i was so greatly moved by the drama that i cried aloud at the screen crown please don't take bess i was fortunate enough to see the one tv broadcast of bess so many years ago and now all i have are the great memories and the record album to remember this wonderful wonderful movie i have been waiting and wishing and hoping that one day i might own a copy of bess but it doesn't look like it will happen what is the hold up obviously there is enough public interest in this movie to warrant a release after all these years i remember it and it sure seems like i'm not alone this movie is brimming with human emotion jealousy lust anger bravery determination bess is a buried gem that deserves to be brought forth into the light for a new audience to admire and an old audience to relish
<START> i found this robin williams vehicle mildly amusing at best i guess you would call it a political satire of sorts it's about a political talk show host comedian who decides to run for president and unexpectedly wins i found most of the humour dry myself and robin williams is much more restrained and sedate than usual i would say the movie is more of a drama than a comedy with a bit of mystery and suspense i think the dramatic parts worked better than the comedy parts and the mystery and suspense aspect though that's a small part of the movie worked the best still i wouldn't rate this movie very high for me it was an ok waste of 2 hours but nothing special my best advice would be to catch it on tv cable or rent it cheap first before making a decision on whether to purchase my vote for man of the year is a 4 10
<START> an unusual film for an audience outside the usa lena horne looks fabulous and so does ralph cooper there is not added background of tap steps as in other musicals so you do not hear the beat of the taps which is great realism music is muted to hear what dancing steps there are acting is a little stilted and the casts speak slowly so that you think the movie is older than it is costumes are daring for the time in the dance routines at the end often feels like you are part of an audience at a stage show what furniture you see is very modern which adds to the movies feeling of other worldliness a must for all film buffs
<START> not as bad as 1992's nails where hopper plays an unstable cop but pretty bad how can a movie with such a great cast go so wrong this film manages to find a way the story was pretty stupid and hopper's direction seemed like he had never directed before all of the long shots in the beginning were bothersome lots of meaningless scenes with a lot of meaningless dialogue
<START> i was able to see a preview of this movie through pre screening program and let me tell you this movie is unbelievably good i have seen many movies but few have made me laugh so sincerely or talk about the movie afterward as much as this one i had a decent respect for tenacious d before seeing the movie and now i am mad about them i will most definitely buy their album when it is released on the 14th and will see this movie again br br if you were on the fence about seeing this movie get off and go see it it is worth the extremely expensive price of movie tickets these days as you will surely bust a nut laughing during the whole thing br br aside from the comedy the glorious and divine music that flows from guitar and voice is awe inspiring the audience is left in a stupor that such beautiful harmonies and amazing riffs can be created in conjunction with such ridiculous and hilarious lyrics if for nothing other than the music itself this movie is worth the price of admission br br with a wonderfully coherent storyline tying in almost all aspects of the traditional d history and hallmarks great new songs hilarious comedy and some pretty awesome cameos this movie ranks up there with the best go see it
<START> going' down to south park is a 1hr long documentary about south park with interviews with trey parker and matt stone and all the other people who work on south park there really isn't much to say it shows the history of south park and what it takes to make one episode it is basically a behind the scenes of the show it shows the different merchandise that south park has made it was really comedy central who put it out it also shows the controversy which was caused by south park it shows plenty of funny clips from the show as well it's a fairly funny documentary any fan of south park should check this out you can find it on youtube br br 9 10
<START> edward crossfire is a rare film coming from the hollywood of the 1940s this was groundbreaking territory for mr and the studio because of what the director and his adapter john paxton decided to do with the novel in which the film is based br br if you haven't seen the film please stop reading now br br richard brooks novel was about the killing of a gay soldier in the movie the subject matter was turned around to prejudice against jews a theme that was taboo during that time in the american cinema it's to mr credit to have had the courage to get involved with this film project at all br br the movie is an outstanding piece of film making because the way the director presents it obviously influenced by the film noir style we are taken to the washington of the post war the opening scene about the brutal murder of shows such unusual cruelty being inflicted to a decent man who we don't know yet or why has been killed but who didn't deserve to die in such horrible fashion br br the basis of the murder is prejudice pure and simple we realize how in the mind of an ignorant man the mere fact of being successful and different plays in the mind of the assassin stands as the sacrificial lamb the same way the gay soldier is the victim in the novel the parallels are well drawn br br this film makes compelling viewing because of the brilliant star turn of robert ryan as montgomery mr ryan was an actor that always played interesting roles but never so well as in crossfire also there is a great appearance by gloria grahame as ginny the prostitute with her heart in the right place br br the rest of the cast play as an ensemble robert young as the police detective in charge of the investigation plays is a decent man who has known prejudice first hand in his own family and speaks loudly against it robert mitchum plays a cool sgt who is deeply touched by the crime when one of his men is accused of committing it sam levene is excellent in his small role of br br this is a film to watch because of it probably the first to speak out loud against ignorance
