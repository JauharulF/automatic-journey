<START> this film is simply appalling how the talent involved made this is beyond human belief they must have been boozing when they thought of this idea i feel as if 2 hours of my life have been taken from me harvey will try and distance himself from this rubbish it should have been a great crime movie but it develops into a gory mess of vampires i would recommend this film to people who like to sleep through movies you wont miss a thing the humour is set to appeal to the lowest common dominate movies can uplift us and remind us that life is worth living this film just depresses you as deniro said in one movie the saddest thing in life is wasted talent this film is a perfect example of this statement
<START> i remember seeing a clip of this movie on hbo when i was a kid and it scared the ever living crap out of me when i found it i watched it i wish i hadn't the movie wasn't scary br br the plot revolves around an old woman running the castle she feeds this horribly disfigured person in the cellar of a 12 century castle she continuously beats the poor guy every day and feeds him well that day she dies then a few months later a family moves in a father a mother and their blind daughter the father was involved in a horrific car accident that got their son killed and left their daughter blind br br later through the film the daughter hears sounds things break etc and everybody is not concerned about anything at all that is until a few people turn up dead apparently the creature in the cellar has broken free and is killing people how this thing survived for the past few months without food or water is impossible every time i saw the creature it gave me the creeps the creature goes on a gory killing spree and the police blame the father for the deaths br br it was a pretty bad film br br i give this film 3 stars out of 10 creepy not scary
<START> i really refused to see this movie i refused to go with the school and i refused to go with my parents just by looking at the trailer it looked stupid to me anyway one of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me 2 choices the dukes of hazzard or wallace and gromit the curse of the were rabbit it took me 17 minutes to decide time was running out i had to choose it came up on the screen few as in a few tickets left by the time we had to line up and get our ticket only one of us could go in i desperately wanted nicholas to go in to see it but he forced me i crossed my arms and was very moody and disappointed that i was going in to see this childishness i walked in sat in the only seat that was available and prepared for the movie must say i was very surprised that i sat through that masterpiece it was amazing i don't know what i was complaining about the clay animation was by far the most best i've ever seen in my life the story was brilliant about a rabbit disrupting and crashing a carnival that had been planned for over 500 years basically anti pest control are protecting the people who are competing in the vegetable competition anti known as wallace and gromit who are in charge of this business try to keep all the rabbits away from the vegetable carnival i wont say anymore it's just too good to tell i'll admit that the whole idea of a were rabbit is ab it unbelievable and ab it childish but nick park adds substance to it which what makes everyone love it i mean there wont be a 10 foot rabbit on the loose and there definitely wont be 8 foot werewolves as said in dog soldiers then again were rabbits and werewolves aren't actual creatures but either way it worked out very well br br the jokes also were more grown up the kids wont get some of the jokes it goes way above their heads it had a lot of british jokes in there if you love british humor this is the movie for you br br i also loved the cast and the voices everything about the movie is so incredibly well done the direction and pacing was absolutely fantastic i recommend this to fans of the old wallace and gromit shorts and no i haven't seen them yet and i recommend it to fans who liked shrek and shrek 2 and most importantly i recommend it to the people who love clay animation cracking good movie 10 10
<START> saw the film at the hollywood film festival in oct '04 mark robertson took a huge chance writing an extremely difficult part for his first film and it paid off big in his casting of kelly i had a strong feeling she came from the theater so i looked her up here and surprise i'm right more hollywood actors should follow her lead give up the expensive acting classes and get back to theater because only with that kind of training will you be prepared for a ride like this for all the great things i can say about the film and the director and there are many i just can't stop talking to people about kelly masterful performance we'll be seeing a lot more of her work no doubt br br congratulations to mark and kelly on a daring film get it out in the theaters so i can bring all the people i made want to see the film asap
<START> i see that c thomas howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor br br i bought this dvd because it was cheap and in part for the internet related plot and to see how much older c thomas howell is i do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s br br in just a few words what a very big disappointment i give some low budget movies a chance but this one started out lame within the first 15 minutes of the movie this elusive woman is chatting with an asian guy in a they basically stimulate themselves to their own chat she then insists on meeting the participant in person she meets him has sex ties him up and then murders him in cold blood the plot then deteriorates further br br the plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff do not bother renting it much less purchasing it even if it is in the 1 dvd bin i plan to take my copy of the dvd to goodwill i am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating
<START> i remember seeing this years ago it had a reasonably promising start with an interesting premise but then it degenerated into nonsense quite quickly uninteresting characters failed attempts to add drama and tension and a bit of simplistic philosophy thrown in too all culminating in a terrible ending br br simply it's trash br br before i saw this tv film i didn't think i would ever have any film that i thought was the worst i had seen but after i finished watching this i knew that from then on if anyone asked me what the worst film i had ever seen was i could say without hesitation the second coming br br avoid
<START> while there is a lot to recommend about maetel legend both in concept and finished product it's ultimately a poor film plot wise it's a retelling of maetel's early life which is usually unclear at the same time the writers take the opportunity to tell the story of the machine empire and since leiji matsumoto has trouble not including his other work we get a starting point for emeraldas her sister her mother the queen of la and a bit of galaxy express 999 to flesh out the film br br in short maetel is a princess on the planet la a planet with an irregular orbit thus meaning its cycle around the nearest sun is reaching a cold stage and it's artificial sun is dying the planet grows increasingly colder throughout the story thus increasing the sense of doom in order to protect her subjects and family the queen decides that mechanisation is the only way to ensure survival of la people enter lord a robot cyborg who provides the means for the job through the film the characters are left to question mechanisation will they still be human can be trusted do souls and hearts remain so for a fan of matsumoto's work there's lots to enjoy questions to be answered themes continued except it's obvious that the film is meant to be an introduction as well as a fan curiosity the negatives foremost the animation while galaxy express 999 a tv series from over 20 years ago has shoddy mouth animation and at times sketchy character design maetel legend has all the worst traits of modern animation and thus earns an air of respectability to galaxy express 999 the design is well detailed but unfortunately the animation has suffered leaving well drawn characters that as in the backgrounds move or the camera zooms a quick way of animating however the few yes few well animated scenes are re used over and over in dream sequences repetition and in extra scenes anyone who's seem the film will wonder how many times lord can drink the same glass of wine br br next the story while in concept everything sounds great the finished product is in fact a series of conversations of plot which are repeated over and over to little effect the number of times the characters encounter the same problems and learn the same things is practically insulting to the audience and the characters which are seemingly much more articulate in former incarnations add to all of that some terrible character design that seem lifeless over exaggerated and the audience is left with a movie so miss handled it might as well have been rewritten as a different film at least the newcomers wouldn't be left baffled br br and yet it really has its moments the ending at least is surprising the plight of the citizens of la was quite affecting and rightly disturbing i guess i find that whole man machine theme distressing it's hard know who to recommend maetel legend to since it's not well animated written or executed plus confusing once leiji matsumoto's mandatory cross referencing is introduced however i can't help but brighten up when the magnificent entrance of three nine occurs now that's good cinema br br 1 5 stars out of 5 2 if you're a fan
<START> orson welles' 1974 documentary f for fake examines trickery and fraud mainly focusing on two men who have been exposed as frauds themselves clifford irving is a biographer who wrote the allegedly fraudulent howard hughes autobiography yet at least it seems purports his innocence the other main subject of the film is artist de a man who has spent his life painting fakes of famous masterpieces sometimes selling them to museums as real works by the original artists interspersed among these stories are bits where welles does magic tricks to illustrate points etc and he also addresses the fact that his career began as a fraud when he first lied on his resume and then created a radio sensation with war of the worlds br br i really wanted to love this film and find it profound since i am such a welles devotee but i couldn't bring myself to do it part of the problem lied with the fact that it was not just non linear it was completely scattered while i appreciate stylish editing and quick jumps and zooms particularly when used in an unusual format such as a documentary there was simply too much of it going on in f for fake they created a distraction as opposed to lending style if the story had been more clear and comprehensive i think that the editing probably would not have been as annoying the scattered storytelling was made all the more obnoxious by the fact that these were truly interesting subjects particularly de his artistic fakery brings up the topic of fraud in the art world and who is truly able to determine the authenticity of certain works and if the works are not authentic what does it say about those who admire the pieces in museums this is one documentary that i would say to at least give a shot but don't be afraid to turn it off if you're not enjoying it it is certainly the most discombobulated documentary i have ever seen it is a cross between a documentary an art film and experimental film none of which is properly represented or isolated i don't have any lesser opinion of welles after seeing it but it certainly in my opinion doesn't stand out as a glowing specimen in his oeuvre 4 10 shelly
<START> warning this review may contain spoilers the back of the box is misleading it says all this crap about kids telling ghost stories which they do but then it implies that they will all be killed by some killer in the woods this doesn't happen the stories they tell are a little interesting specifically the one with the dog and all that licking but most are rather boring monsters in the woods some mute girl and the main one the whole movie
<START> i only saw this film once a quarter of a century ago yet it's impact has never left me and i can still remember even now my reactions to it i was mesmerised by the breadth and the sheer beauty of so much of the photography i was astounded that an american studio could produce such a european film with it's slow pace and its unfocused plot the lack of any strong characters felt like a flaw but i raged at the completely unnecessary ending on the yacht which seemed as though it was bolted on to give some kind of plot cohesion and which was entirely at odds with the style of the rest of the picture it was also refreshing to see a western which made no pretence about the brutality and exploitation that so often was the unfortunate detritus of the american dream the western scenes and sets also had an authenticity which was entirely new to me and which the recent deadwood series the film was massively cut for the american audience and its my very real wish that in these days of director's cuts that michael cimino is given the opportunity of a fresh edit in the light of reflection a cut which could turn this ill fated movie into the masterpiece it had the potential to become i have now seen the original first cut and the network of relationships makes so much more sense although christopher walken is responsible mainly for carrying this off if only de niro and not kris kristofferson had played the main lead there was still a massive preoccupation with creating the reality and atmosphere to the detriment of a good script nevertheless the camera work was so cleverly handled that at times you could almost believe you were inside the action yourself and there were many special moments everybody arguing in the hall in different languages trying to overcome their national differences and seek some unity of action in face of the impending disaster gave a real insight into the difficulties facing the welding together of the usa especially when the threat came from a combination of the old elite and money faltering approach to ella when she first visited his cabin stood in stark contrast to the violence that was to follow and was another one i had a special showing with a large group of mates to see the new cut and we all enjoyed it whilst having varying reservations this revisionist and much closer to the truth version of events was probably too much for americans to take when the film was first released but we all felt it had enormous merit and that its place in cinema history was also due for major revision
<START> george mildred the movie lacks the talents of its tv writer john mortimer who brings the close quarter cut and thrust of george's class war with the alive br br the plot is cut from standard spin off cloth hit man mistaken identity and has as little tension as there are laughs the producers should have taken a leaf from rising damp also 1980 which was also bought to the big screen after the tv series demise and kept much of the story in familiar setting br br yootha joyce died in 1980 but she should not be remembered for this creaking piece of work encumbered as she was by her illness mildred lacks the sharpness of her tv incarnation cutting asides and withering looks largely directed at georges lack of libido george's sputtering incredulity also gets lost in the more expansive sets this is not to say that they were much to shout about the budget for this movies looks pathetically small a restaurant they go to is clearly a new semi starched house with some christmas lights adorning the front door br br for fans of 70's british comedy or those who just want to revisit an old tv companion from their youth this film can add nothing to the experience and they should just stick to the first four tv series out now on dvd
<START> this film was really terrible br br however it's worth seeing as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene ever i mean this thing went on for about 7 8 minutes repeating the same over and over thats almost 10 of the whole film i haven't laughed as hard as i laughed at that for a long time br br there were some seriously strange and pointless goings on in this film but the one that i found funniest was when for no reason whatsoever a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run in to the complex near the end 2 minutes later they run out again what the hell was that for also the tiny white forklift that magically changed into a huge yellow digger was pretty classic i'm led to beleive that this is because they used footage from the trilogy to patch up this absolute donkey i'm gonna have to see those now br br the film is worth watching for a laugh or two but if you dont find bad movies funny stay away
<START> set in bam hometown of westchester pa is a semi true story about the life of ryan dunn and his buddies falcone and br br dunn has been dumped by his girlfriend of 2 years who is now seeing a beer swilling long haired metal head named and this is driving dunn insane with jealousy br br in a desperate attempt to find out the truth about what is going on between and hellboy dunn pays his friends and falcone to break into her house and produce evidence of the affair with somewhat disastrous results for all concerned i found this movie very funny maybe partly because i am a total jackass and fan and it has to be said that a lot of the humour will probably be lost on those that do not have prior knowledge of insane brand of 'comedy' br br the movie contains much that will be of interest to skaters not least the cameo appearance of skateboarding legend tony hawk as a police officer there are also cameo's from brandon novak jason ellis and long suffering parents april and phil br br the dvd extra's include music video's from featuring brother jess on drums and favourite band him character in the movie takes his name from him frontman ville there is also a documentary and a too hot for jackass skit br br in summary as i said before this movie will mainly be of interest to skaters and jackass fans but i do feel that and co have made a great effort with and i for one thoroughly enjoyed it
<START> i saw this movie on it's opening night and enjoyed it i probably would have enjoyed it more if i hadn't been sitting by my father my father saw the original unfortunately i have not seen it yet and kept talking through the whole thing he kept saying that the movie sucked and that it was stupid the thing is he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film in every horror movie there is always a certain character depicted if they weren't in the movie well you might not really like it too much the trademark characters are br br the lead character carly elisha cuthbert the lead character's boyfriend wade jared the lead character's sibling soon to be reformed jerk nick chad michael murray the annoying sluttish character paige paris hilton characters who are just around to look pretty dalton jon abrahams blake robert ri'chard br br with those characters it makes it slightly predictable who will die and who will live obviously you know who will with what i just typed the movie may be predictable in fact i had a pretty good idea who would die just by watching the trailer but it was still enjoyable it may seem stupid why is there a sugar mill in the middle of a deserted camp site that wasn't there in the beginning at times but it is very easy to watch the comedy and gore were the perfect amount for weak stomached movie goers it does get gory don't get me wrong less than final destination 2 but it works very well so in conclusion this movie wasn't as hot as the fire the set went up in but the temperature could still burn the wax
<START> i waited long to watch this movie also because i like bruce willis the plot was quite different from what i had expected but still quite good its a good mix of emotions humor and drama br br left me thinking over and again
